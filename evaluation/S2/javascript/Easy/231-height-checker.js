// Problem Description:
// A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.
//
// You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
//
// Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].
//
// Example:
// Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 
// heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
// expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
// Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= heights.length <= 100
// 	1 <= heights[i] <= 100
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: When asked to count the total number of valid or well-formed bracket sequences of a certain length or with a specific number of pairs. This often involves combinatorial reasoning or dynamic programming.
//   • Idea: Counts the total number of valid bracket sequences of a given length or with a specific number of pairs, where each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. This problem often has a combinatorial solution, typically involving Catalan numbers, with a time complexity of O(N) or O(N^2) for DP.
//   • Invariants: At any prefix of the sequence, the number of open brackets is greater than or equal to the number of closing brackets.; The total number of open brackets in the sequence equals the total number of closing brackets.
//   • Tips: Recognize the pattern for Catalan numbers if applicable.; Dynamic programming can be used for more complex variations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the balance constraint (open count >= close count).; Overcounting or undercounting sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
