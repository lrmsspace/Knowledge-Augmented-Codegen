// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-distinct-averages/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length.
//
// As long as nums is not empty, you must repetitively:
//
//
// 	Find the minimum number in nums and remove it.
// 	Find the maximum number in nums and remove it.
// 	Calculate the average of the two removed numbers.
//
//
// The average of two numbers a and b is (a + b) / 2.
//
//
// 	For example, the average of 2 and 3 is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
//
//
// Return the number of distinct averages calculated using the above process.
//
// Note that when there is a tie for a minimum or maximum number, any can be removed.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [4,1,4,0,3,5]
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// 1. Remove 0 and 5, and the average is (0 + 5) / 2 = 2.5. Now, nums = [4,1,4,3].
// 2. Remove 1 and 4. The average is (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5, and nums = [4,3].
// 3. Remove 3 and 4, and the average is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.
// Since there are 2 distinct numbers among 2.5, 2.5, and 3.5, we return 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	nums.length is even.
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 100

// - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer, merge-sort, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this when finding the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance in a 2D plane. It efficiently handles large datasets by recursively dividing the problem and merging results.
//   • Idea: It finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively dividing the set, solving subproblems, and merging results in O(N log N) time. The merge step efficiently handles cross-boundary pairs within a narrow strip.
//   • Invariants: The minimum distance returned by a recursive call is the true minimum for its input subset.; All points in the left subproblem have x-coordinates less than or equal to the median x-coordinate.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort points by x-coordinate to enable efficient splitting.; Maintain a y-sorted list of points for efficient merging of the strip.
//   • Pitfalls: An inefficient merge step can degrade complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2).; Failing to correctly identify and process cross-boundary pairs.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (ds, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently find the smallest non-negative integer not present in a dynamic sequence or range, supporting both updates and queries in logarithmic time.
//   • Idea: This technique finds the Minimal Excluded (MEX) value in a sequence by maintaining counts of distinct elements in ranges using a specialized data structure, typically a segment tree. It supports both updates and queries in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each segment tree node accurately reflects the count of distinct numbers within its corresponding range.; If a range [L, R) contains R-L distinct numbers, then all integers from L to R-1 are present.
//   • Tips: Implement a segment tree where each node stores the count of distinct numbers in its range.; The binary search for MEX checks if a range [0, k) contains k distinct numbers to decide which child to traverse.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating distinct counts in segment tree nodes, especially after updates.; Off-by-one errors when comparing the number of distinct elements with the expected count for a full range.
// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
