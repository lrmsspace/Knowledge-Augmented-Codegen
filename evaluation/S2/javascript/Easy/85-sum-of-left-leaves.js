// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-left-leaves/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.
//
// A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
// Output: 24
// Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
// 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, quickselect)
//   • When to use: Use when maintaining an ordered collection of elements that requires efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. It is also suitable for finding minimum, maximum, floor, and ceiling values.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Core operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(h) time, where h is the tree's height.
//   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are less than its own key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are greater than its own key.
//   • Tips: Maintain subtree sizes for order-statistic operations like finding the k-th smallest element.; Consider self-balancing variants (AVL, Red-Black) to guarantee O(log N) worst-case performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade to O(N) performance for all operations.; Forgetting to update parent pointers or subtree sizes during modifications.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
