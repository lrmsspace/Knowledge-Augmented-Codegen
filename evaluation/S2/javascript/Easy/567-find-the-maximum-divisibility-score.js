// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-divisibility-score/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two integer arrays nums and divisors.
//
// The divisibility score of divisors[i] is the number of indices j such that nums[j] is divisible by divisors[i].
//
// Return the integer divisors[i] with the maximum divisibility score. If multiple integers have the maximum score, return the smallest one.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,9,15,50], divisors = [5,3,7,2]
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
// The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 2 since nums[2] and nums[3] are divisible by 5.
//
// The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 2 since nums[1] and nums[2] are divisible by 3.
//
// The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 0 since none of the numbers in nums is divisible by 7.
//
// The divisibility score of divisors[3] is 2 since nums[0] and nums[3] are divisible by 2.
//
// As divisors[0], divisors[1], and divisors[3] have the same divisibility score, we return the smaller one which is divisors[3].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length, divisors.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= nums[i], divisors[i] <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer, typically by leveraging its prime factorization.
//   • Idea: The number of divisors d(n) and sum of divisors sigma(n) are arithmetic functions derived from the prime factorization of an integer n. Both can be computed efficiently by first finding prime factors and their exponents, resulting in an O(sqrt(N)) or O(log N) complexity with precomputed primes.
//   • Invariants: The current count of divisors is the product of (exponent + 1) for all prime factors found so far.; The current sum of divisors is the product of (1 + p + ... + p^e) for all prime factors found so far.
//   • Tips: Precompute primes using a sieve for efficiency when dealing with multiple queries or large numbers.; For sum of divisors, the formula is sigma(n) = product((1 + p_i + ... + p_i^e_i)) for each prime factor p_i^e_i.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle n=1 correctly, which has one divisor.; Integer overflow when calculating sums or products of large powers, especially for sum of divisors.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
