// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-tested-devices-after-test-operations/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array batteryPercentages having length n, denoting the battery percentages of n 0-indexed devices.
//
// Your task is to test each device i in order from 0 to n - 1, by performing the following test operations:
//
//
// 	If batteryPercentages[i] is greater than 0:
//
// 	
// 		Increment the count of tested devices.
// 		Decrease the battery percentage of all devices with indices j in the range [i + 1, n - 1] by 1, ensuring their battery percentage never goes below 0, i.e, batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1).
// 		Move to the next device.
// 	
// 	
// 	Otherwise, move to the next device without performing any test.
//
//
// Return an integer denoting the number of devices that will be tested after performing the test operations in order.
//
// Example:
// Input: batteryPercentages = [1,1,2,1,3]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:
// At device 0, batteryPercentages[0] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,2].
// At device 1, batteryPercentages[1] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
// At device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,1].
// At device 3, batteryPercentages[3] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
// At device 4, batteryPercentages[4] > 0, so there are now 3 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.
// So, the answer is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == batteryPercentages.length <= 100 
// 	0 <= batteryPercentages[i] <= 100

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (array, heap, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when given a set of tasks with deadlines and durations, and the objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks without interruption.
//   • Idea: This greedy algorithm aims to maximize the number of jobs completed by prioritizing tasks that finish earliest. It typically involves sorting and using a min-heap, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed up to the current point have been considered for scheduling.; The set of jobs in the heap represents the jobs currently scheduled to meet their deadlines.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by their deadlines in ascending order.; Maintain a min-heap of durations for jobs currently scheduled.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing job count maximization with total duration or profit.; Failing to update the current time correctly after scheduling a job.
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It is ideal for scenarios requiring both fast query and update operations on an array.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is an array-based data structure that efficiently calculates prefix sums and updates individual elements in an array. It supports both point updates and prefix sum queries in O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each `T[i]` stores the sum of a specific range `[g(i), i]` from the original array.; The `sum(idx)` function correctly aggregates values from `A[0]` to `A[idx]`.
//   • Tips: Understand the bit manipulation (`i & -i`) for navigating parent/child relationships.; Consistently choose and apply either 0-based or 1-based indexing throughout the implementation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0-based versus 1-based indexing can lead to off-by-one errors.; Forgetting to initialize the tree or performing updates incorrectly will yield wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
