// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-to-target-string-in-a-circular-array/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed circular string array words and a string target. A circular array means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.
//
//
// 	Formally, the next element of words[i] is words[(i + 1) % n] and the previous element of words[i] is words[(i - 1 + n) % n], where n is the length of words.
//
//
// Starting from startIndex, you can move to either the next word or the previous word with 1 step at a time.
//
// Return the shortest distance needed to reach the string target. If the string target does not exist in words, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["hello","i","am","leetcode","hello"], target = "hello", startIndex = 1
// Output: 1
// Explanation: We start from index 1 and can reach "hello" by
// - moving 3 units to the right to reach index 4.
// - moving 2 units to the left to reach index 4.
// - moving 4 units to the right to reach index 0.
// - moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 0.
// The shortest distance to reach "hello" is 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 100
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 100
// 	words[i] and target consist of only lowercase English letters.
// 	0 <= startIndex < words.length
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Substring Search (string, array, kmp, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern within a larger text, especially when the pattern might have repeating or overlapping prefixes.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that avoids re-scanning characters in the text by pre-processing the pattern to build a 'longest proper prefix suffix' (LPS) array. It achieves optimal O(N + M) time complexity, where N is the text length and M is the pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `j` pointer always indicates the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `text[0...i-1]`.; The `lps[j]` value stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...j-1]`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the LPS array (also known as failure function or border array) for the pattern.; The LPS array helps determine the next best match position after a mismatch, avoiding redundant comparisons.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the LPS array can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors when indexing the pattern or text are common.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring within a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity for this task.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all maximal palindromic substrings centered at each position in a string by leveraging symmetry and previously computed results. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: d_odd[i] stores the radius of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.; The (l, r) interval always defines the rightmost palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with delimiters to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Maintain the current rightmost boundary `r` of the largest palindrome found.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update the `(l, r)` boundaries after processing each center.; Incorrectly calculating mirror positions or handling boundary cases for `i > r`.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
