// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.
//
// Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows
//
//
// 	a, b are from arr
// 	a < b
// 	b - a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [4,2,1,3]
// Output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
// Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= arr.length <= 105
// 	-106 <= arr[i] <= 106
//

// - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer, merge-sort, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this when finding the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance in a 2D plane. It efficiently handles large datasets by recursively dividing the problem and merging results.
//   • Idea: It finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively dividing the set, solving subproblems, and merging results in O(N log N) time. The merge step efficiently handles cross-boundary pairs within a narrow strip.
//   • Invariants: The minimum distance returned by a recursive call is the true minimum for its input subset.; All points in the left subproblem have x-coordinates less than or equal to the median x-coordinate.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort points by x-coordinate to enable efficient splitting.; Maintain a y-sorted list of points for efficient merging of the strip.
//   • Pitfalls: An inefficient merge step can degrade complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2).; Failing to correctly identify and process cross-boundary pairs.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
// - bucket-sort (array, bucket-sort)
//   • When to use: When the input elements are uniformly distributed across a specific range, allowing for efficient partitioning and sorting.
//   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket, then concatenates them. It achieves O(N+K) average time complexity, where N is elements and K is buckets, assuming uniform distribution.
//   • Invariants: All elements from the input are initially present in the unsorted collection.; After distribution, each element resides in exactly one bucket, corresponding to its value range.
//   • Tips: Choose the number of buckets carefully based on data range and distribution.; Use an efficient sorting algorithm for individual buckets (e.g., insertion sort for small buckets).
//   • Pitfalls: Poor performance with non-uniform data distribution, leading to elements clustering in few buckets.; Requires knowing the range of input values beforehand to define bucket boundaries.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
