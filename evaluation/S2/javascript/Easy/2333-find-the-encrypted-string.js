// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-encrypted-string/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s and an integer k. Encrypt the string using the following algorithm:
//
//
// 	For each character c in s, replace c with the kth character after c in the string (in a cyclic manner).
//
//
// Return the encrypted string.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "dart", k = 3
//
// Output: "tdar"
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	For i = 0, the 3rd character after 'd' is 't'.
// 	For i = 1, the 3rd character after 'a' is 'd'.
// 	For i = 2, the 3rd character after 'r' is 'a'.
// 	For i = 3, the 3rd character after 't' is 'r'.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 100
// 	1 <= k <= 104
// 	s consists only of lowercase English letters.

// - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Josephus Problem (number, dp-1d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used to determine the position of the last remaining person in a circle where every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains. It models sequential removal processes in a circular arrangement.
//   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the position of the survivor in a circle of N people, where every K-th person is eliminated. The standard solution uses a recursive relation or dynamic programming, typically achieving O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The result J(n, k) represents the survivor's original 0-indexed position among n people.; Each recursive step J(n, k) correctly transforms the result from J(n-1, k) based on the k-th elimination.
//   • Tips: Use 0-indexing for a simpler and more elegant recursive formula.; Establish the base case for N=1 (the survivor is always 0 or 1).
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when switching between 0-indexing and 1-indexing.; Incorrectly applying the modulo operator, especially with negative results in some languages.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
