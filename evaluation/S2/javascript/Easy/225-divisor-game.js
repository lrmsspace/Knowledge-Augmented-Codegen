//
// Problem Description:
// Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
//
// Initially, there is a number n on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
//
//
// 	Choosing any integer x with 0 < x < n and n % x == 0.
// 	Replacing the number n on the chalkboard with n - x.
//
//
// Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
//
// Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 2
// Output: true
// Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Primality tests (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to determine if a single number is prime, especially for numbers where trial division up to its square root is computationally feasible.
//   • Idea: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This method checks for primality by attempting to find a non-trivial divisor up to the square root of the given number, running in O(sqrt(N)) time.
//   • Invariants: No integer k in the range [2, current_divisor - 1] has been found to divide n.; The current value current_divisor is a candidate divisor being tested against n.
//   • Tips: Only check numbers between 2 and sqrt(n).; Handle 2 as a special case before iterating.
//   • Pitfalls: O(sqrt(N)) complexity can be too slow for very large numbers.; Incorrectly handling edge cases like 0, 1, or 2.
// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
// - Euler's totient function
//  (array, number, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. It is also useful for problems involving modular arithmetic, group theory, and cryptographic applications.
//   • Idea: Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. It can be computed using prime factorization in O(sqrt(N)) or for a range using a sieve in O(N log log N).
//   • Invariants: For a sieve, phi[i] correctly stores the totient value for i after processing all its prime factors.; When factorizing n, n is continuously reduced by its smallest prime factor until it becomes 1.
//   • Tips: For a single n, find its prime factors and apply the product formula.; For computing φ(n) for all n up to a limit, use a sieve similar to Sieve of Eratosthenes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling repeated prime factors in the formula.; Integer overflow when calculating products for very large n.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
