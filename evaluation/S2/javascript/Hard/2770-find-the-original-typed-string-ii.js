// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.
//
// You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen. You are also given a positive integer k.
//
// Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of size at least k.
//
// Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 7
//
// Output: 5
//
// Explanation:
//
// The possible strings are: "aabbccdd", "aabbccd", "aabbcdd", "aabccdd", and "abbccdd".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= word.length <= 5 * 105
//  word consists only of lowercase English letters.
//  1 <= k <= 2000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare strings, find duplicate strings, or perform fast substring searches and pattern matching in O(1) time after initial O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to a numerical value using a polynomial function, enabling O(1) comparison of strings or substrings after O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: prefix_hash[i] stores the polynomial hash of the substring s[0...i-1].; p_power[k] stores p^k mod m for efficient calculation.
//   • Tips: Use two different hash functions with distinct prime `p` and `m` values to minimize collision probability.; Precompute powers of `p` and prefix hashes to enable O(1) substring hash calculation.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions can lead to incorrect results; always consider their possibility.; Integer overflow if modulo operations are not applied correctly at each step of calculation.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
