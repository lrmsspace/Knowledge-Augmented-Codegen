// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-rearrange-sticks-with-k-sticks-visible/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There are n uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from 1 to n. You want to arrange the sticks such that exactly k sticks are visible from the left. A stick is visible from the left if there are no longer sticks to the left of it.
//
//
// 	For example, if the sticks are arranged [1,3,2,5,4], then the sticks with lengths 1, 3, and 5 are visible from the left.
//
//
// Given n and k, return the number of such arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, k = 2
// Output: 3
// Explanation: [1,3,2], [2,3,1], and [2,1,3] are the only arrangements such that exactly 2 sticks are visible.
// The visible sticks are underlined.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 1000
// 	1 <= k <= n
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Factorial modulo 
// p (number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total count of possibilities or arrangements that can be naturally broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems. It's effective for exploring decision trees or state spaces.
//   • Idea: Counting determines the number of elements or event occurrences. It uses combinatorial or iterative/recursive methods, often with O(N) or O(log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each recursive call processes a smaller, well-defined subproblem.; The base cases correctly return the count for the simplest scenarios.
//   • Tips: Identify the smallest subproblem and its base cases to stop recursion.; Define the recursive relation clearly, showing how larger problems depend on smaller ones.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect results.; Overlapping subproblems without memoization can lead to exponential time complexity.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Josephus Problem (number, dp-1d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used to determine the position of the last remaining person in a circle where every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains. It models sequential removal processes in a circular arrangement.
//   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the position of the survivor in a circle of N people, where every K-th person is eliminated. The standard solution uses a recursive relation or dynamic programming, typically achieving O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The result J(n, k) represents the survivor's original 0-indexed position among n people.; Each recursive step J(n, k) correctly transforms the result from J(n-1, k) based on the k-th elimination.
//   • Tips: Use 0-indexing for a simpler and more elegant recursive formula.; Establish the base case for N=1 (the survivor is always 0 or 1).
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when switching between 0-indexing and 1-indexing.; Incorrectly applying the modulo operator, especially with negative results in some languages.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
