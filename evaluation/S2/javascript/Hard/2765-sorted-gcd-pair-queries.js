//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer array queries.
//
// Let gcdPairs denote an array obtained by calculating the GCD of all possible pairs (nums[i], nums[j]), where 0 <= i < j < n, and then sorting these values in ascending order.
//
// For each query queries[i], you need to find the element at index queries[i] in gcdPairs.
//
// Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the value at gcdPairs[queries[i]] for each query.
//
// The term gcd(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,3,4], queries = [0,2,2]
//
// Output: [1,2,2]
//
// Explanation:
//
// gcdPairs = [gcd(nums[0], nums[1]), gcd(nums[0], nums[2]), gcd(nums[1], nums[2])] = [1, 2, 1].
//
// After sorting in ascending order, gcdPairs = [1, 1, 2].
//
// So, the answer is [gcdPairs[queries[0]], gcdPairs[queries[1]], gcdPairs[queries[2]]] = [1, 2, 2].
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n == nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	0 <= queries[i] < n * (n - 1) / 2
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Euler's totient function
//  (array, number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. It is also efficient for computing totient values for all numbers in a given range.
//   • Idea: Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. It can be computed for a single n in O(sqrt(n)) using prime factorization, or for all numbers up to N in O(N log log N) using a sieve-like algorithm.
//   • Invariants: phi[i] stores the current totient value for i, which is i initially, then updated by (1 - 1/p) for each prime p dividing i.; After iterating through all primes p up to sqrt(N), phi[i] holds the correct totient value for all i <= N.
//   • Tips: For a single n, compute φ(n) using its prime factorization.; For all φ(i) up to N, use a sieve approach similar to Sieve of Eratosthenes.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 'relatively prime' with 'prime number'.; Applying the multiplicative property incorrectly when numbers share common factors.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Tarjan's off-line algorithm (tree, ds, dfs, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer multiple Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries on a static tree, and all queries are available before processing.
//   • Idea: Tarjan's off-line LCA algorithm efficiently computes the Lowest Common Ancestor for multiple pairs of nodes in a tree using a single Depth-First Search traversal combined with a Disjoint Set Union data structure, achieving nearly linear time complexity.
//   • Invariants: When DFS is at node `v`, all its children's subtrees have been fully processed and merged into `v`'s DSU set.; For any node `x` whose DFS has completed, `ancestor[find_set(x)]` stores an ancestor of `x` on the path to the root.
//   • Tips: Initialize each node as its own set in DSU with itself as the ancestor.; Process queries for a node only after its children's subtrees are fully processed.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for online LCA queries or dynamic tree structures.; Incorrectly updating the `ancestor` array in the DSU can lead to wrong LCAs.
// - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when performing many range queries on a static array where the query operation is idempotent (e.g., min, max, GCD) to achieve O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
//   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths, allowing O(1) query time for idempotent operations like range minimum/maximum queries. Precomputation takes O(N log N) time and space.
//   • Invariants: The `st[k][i]` entry stores the result of the operation for the range `[i, i + 2^k - 1]`.; All ranges of length `2^k` starting at `i` are correctly computed in `st[k][i]` during precomputation.
//   • Tips: Precompute logarithms for O(1) lookup of `floor(log2(length))` during queries.; Sparse tables are most efficient for idempotent operations (min, max, GCD, OR, AND) due to overlapping segments.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for dynamic arrays or scenarios requiring updates, as modifications invalidate the precomputed table.; High memory usage: requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
