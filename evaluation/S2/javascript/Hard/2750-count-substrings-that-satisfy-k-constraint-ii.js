//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a binary string s and an integer k.
//
// You are also given a 2D integer array queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri].
//
// A binary string satisfies the k-constraint if either of the following conditions holds:
//
//
// 	The number of 0's in the string is at most k.
// 	The number of 1's in the string is at most k.
//
//
// Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the number of substrings of s[li..ri] that satisfy the k-constraint.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "0001111", k = 2, queries = [[0,6]]
//
// Output: [26]
//
// Explanation:
//
// For the query [0, 6], all substrings of s[0..6] = "0001111" satisfy the k-constraint except for the substrings s[0..5] = "000111" and s[0..6] = "0001111".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
// 	1 <= k <= s.length
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	queries[i] == [li, ri]
// 	0 <= li <= ri < s.length
// 	All queries are distinct.

// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, sparse-table, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to perform O(1) range queries on a static array for an associative operation, after an O(N log N) preprocessing step.
//   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries using an associative operation on a static array. It achieves O(1) query time and O(N log N) build time by storing prefix-like sums within logarithmically sized blocks.
//   • Invariants: For each level k, the array is partitioned into 2^k segments.; Within each segment, table[k][j] stores the result of the associative operation from j to the segment's midpoint (or midpoint to j).
//   • Tips: Ensure the operation is associative (e.g., min, max, sum, gcd, bitwise operations).; Preprocessing takes O(N log N) time and space.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for mutable arrays; updates require rebuilding the table.; Requires O(N log N) memory, which can be substantial for very large N.
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
