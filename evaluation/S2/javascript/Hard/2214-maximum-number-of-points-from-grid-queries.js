// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-points-from-grid-queries/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an m x n integer matrix grid and an array queries of size k.
//
// Find an array answer of size k such that for each integer queries[i] you start in the top left cell of the matrix and repeat the following process:
//
//
// 	If queries[i] is strictly greater than the value of the current cell that you are in, then you get one point if it is your first time visiting this cell, and you can move to any adjacent cell in all 4 directions: up, down, left, and right.
// 	Otherwise, you do not get any points, and you end this process.
//
//
// After the process, answer[i] is the maximum number of points you can get. Note that for each query you are allowed to visit the same cell multiple times.
//
// Return the resulting array answer.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[2,5,7],[3,5,1]], queries = [5,6,2]
// Output: [5,8,1]
// Explanation: The diagrams above show which cells we visit to get points for each query.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	2 <= m, n <= 1000
// 	4 <= m * n <= 105
// 	k == queries.length
// 	1 <= k <= 104
// 	1 <= grid[i][j], queries[i] <= 106

// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, sparse-table, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to perform O(1) range queries on a static array for an associative operation, after an O(N log N) preprocessing step.
//   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries using an associative operation on a static array. It achieves O(1) query time and O(N log N) build time by storing prefix-like sums within logarithmically sized blocks.
//   • Invariants: For each level k, the array is partitioned into 2^k segments.; Within each segment, table[k][j] stores the result of the associative operation from j to the segment's midpoint (or midpoint to j).
//   • Tips: Ensure the operation is associative (e.g., min, max, sum, gcd, bitwise operations).; Preprocessing takes O(N log N) time and space.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for mutable arrays; updates require rebuilding the table.; Requires O(N log N) memory, which can be substantial for very large N.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
