// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-in-sums-after-removal-of-elements/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.
//
// You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:
//
//
// 	The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
// 	The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.
//
//
// The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.
//
//
// 	For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
// 	Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.
//
//
// Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,1,2]
// Output: -1
// Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
// Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
// - If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
// - If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
// - If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
// The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1.
//
// Constraints:
// nums.length == 3 * n
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
//

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
// - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
//   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
//   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
// - Second Best Minimum Spanning Tree (graph, array, mst-kruskal, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find a spanning tree with the second smallest total edge weight, often for redundancy or alternative network path planning. It's applicable in scenarios requiring fault tolerance beyond a single optimal solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds a spanning tree with the second minimum total edge weight in a connected, undirected graph. It involves finding the primary MST, then modifying it by replacing one MST edge with a non-MST edge.
//   • Invariants: The primary MST is always a valid spanning tree with minimum total weight.; Adding any non-MST edge (u,v) to the MST creates exactly one cycle.
//   • Tips: First, compute the primary Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using an algorithm like Kruskal's or Prim's.; For each edge not in the MST, adding it to the MST creates a unique cycle. Find the maximum weight edge on this cycle.
//   • Pitfalls: Naively recomputing an entire MST for each removed edge is inefficient (O(V * E log E)).; Incorrectly identifying the maximum weight edge on the cycle formed by adding a non-MST edge.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
