// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-all-possible-routes/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of distinct positive integers locations where locations[i] represents the position of city i. You are also given integers start, finish and fuel representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.
//
// At each step, if you are at city i, you can pick any city j such that j != i and 0 <= j < locations.length and move to city j. Moving from city i to city j reduces the amount of fuel you have by |locations[i] - locations[j]|. Please notice that |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
//
// Notice that fuel cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit any city more than once (including start and finish).
//
// Return the count of all possible routes from start to finish. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
// 1 -> 3
// 1 -> 2 -> 3
// 1 -> 4 -> 3
// 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= locations.length <= 100
// 	1 <= locations[i] <= 109
// 	All integers in locations are distinct.
// 	0 <= start, finish < locations.length
// 	1 <= fuel <= 200

// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Discrete Logarithm (array, number, binary-search, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when solving for the exponent 'x' in the modular equation a^x = b (mod m), especially when 'm' is large and a and m are coprime. It's suitable for finding a solution within O(sqrt(m) log m) time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm, also known as Baby-step Giant-step, finds the smallest non-negative integer 'x' satisfying a^x = b (mod m) using a meet-in-the-middle approach. It achieves a time complexity of O(sqrt(m) log m).
//   • Invariants: The map stores (a^q mod m, q) for all baby steps q in [0, n-1].; For each giant step p, a^(np) mod m is correctly computed.
//   • Tips: Choose 'n' as ceil(sqrt(m)) for balanced steps.; Use a hash map to store baby steps for O(1) average lookup.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect choice of 'n' can lead to suboptimal time complexity.; Failure to check if 'a' and 'm' are coprime may yield no solution or incorrect results.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
