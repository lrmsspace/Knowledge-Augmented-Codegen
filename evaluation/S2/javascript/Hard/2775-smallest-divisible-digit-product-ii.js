// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-divisible-digit-product-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string num which represents a positive integer, and an integer t.
//
// A number is called zero-free if none of its digits are 0.
//
// Return a string representing the smallest zero-free number greater than or equal to num such that the product of its digits is divisible by t. If no such number exists, return "-1".
//
// Example:
// Input: num = "1234", t = 256
//
// Output: "1488"
//
// Explanation:
//
// The smallest zero-free number that is greater than 1234 and has the product of its digits divisible by 256 is 1488, with the product of its digits equal to 256.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= num.length <= 2 * 105
// 	num consists only of digits in the range ['0', '9'].
// 	num does not contain leading zeros.
// 	1 <= t <= 1014
//

// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - Primitive Root (number, mod-exp, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find a generator for the multiplicative group of integers modulo n, or to check if a number is a primitive root. This is often required in number theory problems involving modular arithmetic and cyclic groups.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds a primitive root modulo n by checking candidate numbers and verifying their order using Euler's totient function and its prime factors. The optimized approach significantly reduces checks from O(phi(n)) to O(k * log(n)) for each candidate, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of phi(n).
//   • Invariants: The current candidate g is coprime to n.; The order of g modulo n is being checked against divisors of phi(n).
//   • Tips: First, determine if a primitive root exists for the given n.; Calculate Euler's totient function phi(n) for the modulus n.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check the existence condition for primitive roots.; Incorrectly calculating Euler's totient function phi(n).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
