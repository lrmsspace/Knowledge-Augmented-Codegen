// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-palindrome/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
//
// Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "aacecaaa"
// Output: "aaacecaaa"
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters only.

// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring in a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity by leveraging symmetry.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all palindromic substrings in a string by expanding around centers and utilizing symmetry to avoid redundant comparisons. It achieves a linear time complexity of O(N) by maintaining the rightmost boundary of the longest palindrome found so far.
//   • Invariants: For any index k < i, d[k] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at k.; The pair (l, r) always represents the exclusive boundaries of the palindrome that extends furthest to the right among all processed centers.
//   • Tips: Pre-process the string with delimiters (e.g., '#') to uniformly handle both odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage symmetry: for a center 'i' within the current rightmost palindrome, its mirror 'j' provides a lower bound for the palindrome length at 'i'.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when the mirror palindrome extends beyond the current rightmost palindrome.; Forgetting to update the 'l' and 'r' boundaries after finding a new palindrome that extends further to the right.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, tree, string, recursion)
//   • When to use: When needing to efficiently represent all substrings of a string and perform various string operations like counting occurrences, finding distinct substrings, or pattern matching. It is particularly useful for problems involving properties of all substrings or suffixes.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal deterministic finite automaton that accepts all suffixes of a given string. It efficiently encodes all substrings and their occurrences, typically constructed in O(N) time and space for a string of length N.
//   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton corresponds to a unique endpos set.; All substrings represented by a state are suffixes of the longest string in that state's endpos set.
//   • Tips: Understand the endpos equivalence classes and suffix links.; Construction is typically incremental, character by character.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of implementation can be high due to many edge cases.; Incorrectly handling suffix links during construction.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
