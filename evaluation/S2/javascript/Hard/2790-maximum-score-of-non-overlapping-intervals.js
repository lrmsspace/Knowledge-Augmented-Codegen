// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-of-non-overlapping-intervals/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [li, ri, weighti]. Interval i starts at position li and ends at ri, and has a weight of weighti. You can choose up to 4 non-overlapping intervals. The score of the chosen intervals is defined as the total sum of their weights.
//
// Return the lexicographically smallest array of at most 4 indices from intervals with maximum score, representing your choice of non-overlapping intervals.
//
// Two intervals are said to be non-overlapping if they do not share any points. In particular, intervals sharing a left or right boundary are considered overlapping.
//
// Example:
// Input: intervals = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5],[6,9,3],[6,7,1],[8,9,1]]
//
// Output: [2,3]
//
// Explanation:
//
// You can choose the intervals with indices 2, and 3 with respective weights of 5, and 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= intevals.length <= 5 * 104
// 	intervals[i].length == 3
// 	intervals[i] = [li, ri, weighti]
// 	1 <= li <= ri <= 109
// 	1 <= weighti <= 109

// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: When tasks need to be processed sequentially on a single resource to optimize a cumulative metric like total completion time or weighted sum of completion times.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal sequence for processing jobs on a single machine by applying a greedy strategy, often involving sorting based on specific criteria. It typically achieves an optimal schedule in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The list of jobs is sorted according to the chosen greedy criterion.; For any prefix of the sorted jobs, the current schedule minimizes the objective function for those jobs.
//   • Tips: Identify the correct sorting key (e.g., processing time, weight/time ratio) for the objective function.; Prove optimality using an exchange argument to justify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying an incorrect sorting criterion for the specific optimization objective.; Assuming a greedy approach is always optimal without a formal proof.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, segment-tree, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence such that elements in the subsequence are in strictly increasing order, preserving their original relative order.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search or a segment tree.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or DP array) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index 'i', 'tails[i]' stores the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array where dp[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Binary search is used to find the correct position for the current element in the dp array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates for strictly increasing versus non-decreasing requirements.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
