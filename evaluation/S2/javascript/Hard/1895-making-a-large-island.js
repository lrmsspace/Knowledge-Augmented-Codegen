// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/making-a-large-island/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an n x n binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1.
//
// Return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.
//
// An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with area = 3.
//
// Constraints:
// n == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= n <= 500
// 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Search for connected components in a graph (graph, dfs, bfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to partition an undirected graph into maximal connected subgraphs where every node is reachable from every other node within its subgraph.
//   • Idea: This algorithm identifies all connected components in an undirected graph by iteratively performing graph traversals (DFS or BFS) from unvisited nodes. It has a time complexity of O(V + E) for adjacency list representation.
//   • Invariants: All nodes visited so far belong to an identified connected component.; Any node currently being visited is part of the current connected component being explored.
//   • Tips: Maintain a visited array or set to track processed nodes.; Iterate through all nodes, starting a new traversal if a node is unvisited.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to iterate through all nodes to find all components in a disconnected graph.; Not correctly marking nodes as visited during traversal, leading to infinite loops or re-processing.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
