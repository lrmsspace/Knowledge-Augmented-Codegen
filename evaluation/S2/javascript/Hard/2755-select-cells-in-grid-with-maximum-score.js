// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/select-cells-in-grid-with-maximum-score/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D matrix grid consisting of positive integers.
//
// You have to select one or more cells from the matrix such that the following conditions are satisfied:
//
//
// 	No two selected cells are in the same row of the matrix.
// 	The values in the set of selected cells are unique.
//
//
// Your score will be the sum of the values of the selected cells.
//
// Return the maximum score you can achieve.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,3,2],[1,1,1]]
//
// Output: 8
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
// We can select the cells with values 1, 3, and 4 that are colored above.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 10
// 	1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
//

// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Minimum spanning tree - Prim's algorithm (graph, heap, array, mst-prim, greedy, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree in a connected, weighted graph. It is efficient for both dense graphs (O(V^2)) and sparse graphs (O(E log V)) depending on the implementation.
//   • Idea: Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds an MST by iteratively adding the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the growing tree to a vertex outside the tree. It has a time complexity of O(V^2) for dense graphs using an adjacency matrix or O(E log V) for sparse graphs using a priority queue.
//   • Invariants: All selected vertices and edges form a connected component of the final MST.; For any unselected vertex `v`, `min_e[v]` stores the minimum weight of an edge connecting `v` to the currently selected component.
//   • Tips: For dense graphs, an O(V^2) implementation using an an adjacency matrix and simple array scans is efficient.; For sparse graphs, use a priority queue (min-heap) with an adjacency list to achieve O(E log V) complexity.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating the `min_e` array or priority queue entries can lead to an incorrect MST or performance issues.; Forgetting to mark vertices as 'selected' can lead to cycles or infinite loops.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (matrix, array, dp-2d, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count elements satisfying "at least one" of several properties, especially when direct counting is complicated by overlapping sets. It's also applicable for counting elements satisfying "none" of the properties by subtracting from the total.
//   • Idea: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle is a combinatorial method to determine the size of the union of multiple finite sets. It works by summing the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all pairwise intersections, adding back the sizes of all three-way intersections, and so on, with alternating signs.
//   • Invariants: The count for any element satisfying `k` properties is adjusted to be exactly 1 in the final sum.; Each term in the sum corresponds to the size of an intersection of a distinct subset of properties.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the universe and the properties (sets) you are interested in.; Systematically list all combinations of properties for intersection terms.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying or defining the properties or sets.; Missing certain intersection terms or double-counting them.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
