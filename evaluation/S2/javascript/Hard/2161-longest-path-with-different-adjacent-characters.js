// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-path-with-different-adjacent-characters/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) rooted at node 0 consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array parent of size n, where parent[i] is the parent of node i. Since node 0 is the root, parent[0] == -1.
//
// You are also given a string s of length n, where s[i] is the character assigned to node i.
//
// Return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.
//
// Example:
// Input: parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = "abacbe"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
// It can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions.
//
// Constraints:
// n == parent.length == s.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1 for all i >= 1
// 	parent[0] == -1
// 	parent represents a valid tree.
// 	s consists of only lowercase English letters.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Tries (trie, tree, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing a collection of strings and requiring efficient prefix-based operations like search, insertion, deletion, or finding the longest common prefix.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where nodes represent characters and paths from the root represent strings. Operations like insertion, search, and deletion typically take O(L) time, where L is the length of the key.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node's children pointers correspond to the next character in a string.
//   • Tips: Mark nodes as 'end of word' to distinguish prefixes from complete words.; Use an array for children pointers if the alphabet size is small and fixed (e.g., ASCII).
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or very deep tries due to many empty child pointers.; Deletion can be complex, requiring careful handling of nodes that are part of other words.
// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
