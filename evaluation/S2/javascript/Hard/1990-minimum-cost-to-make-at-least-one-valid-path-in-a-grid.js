// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-at-least-one-valid-path-in-a-grid/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:
//
//
// 	1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
// 	2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
// 	3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
// 	4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])
//
//
// Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.
//
// You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.
//
// You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.
//
// Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: You will start at point (0, 0).
// The path to (3, 3) is as follows. (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (1, 3) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 0) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (2, 0) --> (2, 1) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (3, 3)
// The total cost = 3.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 100
// 	1 <= grid[i][j] <= 4
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - N/A
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
