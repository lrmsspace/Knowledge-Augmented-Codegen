// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-prefix/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// A string is called a happy prefix if is a non-empty prefix which is also a suffix (excluding itself).
//
// Given a string s, return the longest happy prefix of s. Return an empty string "" if no such prefix exists.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "level"
// Output: "l"
// Explanation: s contains 4 prefix excluding itself ("l", "le", "lev", "leve"), and suffix ("l", "el", "vel", "evel"). The largest prefix which is also suffix is given by "l".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s contains only lowercase English letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Used for efficient string searching and pattern matching in linear time. It's also fundamental for various string algorithms that leverage self-matching properties.
//   • Idea: The prefix function computes for each position in a string the length of the longest proper prefix of its substring that is also a suffix of that substring. This forms the core of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm, enabling linear time O(N) string matching.
//   • Invariants: For each i, pi[i] is the length of the longest proper prefix of s[0...i] that is also a suffix of s[0...i].; The current j (length of the matched prefix) always represents pi[i-1] or a shorter valid prefix length.
//   • Tips: The prefix function array (pi array) stores lengths, not indices.; It can be used to build the KMP automaton for pattern matching.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing proper prefix/suffix with non-proper ones.; Incorrectly handling the base case pi[0] = 0.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently represent all distinct substrings of a string, or perform various string operations like counting unique substrings, finding occurrences, or string matching in an online fashion.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a powerful data structure that represents all distinct substrings of a given string in a compact form, typically as a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG). It can be constructed in linear time O(N) and space O(N) for a string of length N.
//   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end-positions in the original string.; For any state `v`, `len(v)` is the length of the longest string represented by `v`.
//   • Tips: Understand the properties of `len` (length of the longest string in a state) and `link` (suffix link to the longest proper suffix).; The construction is online, processing characters one by one from left to right.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `link` updates, especially when cloning states during construction.; Forgetting to update the `last` pointer after each character addition step.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
