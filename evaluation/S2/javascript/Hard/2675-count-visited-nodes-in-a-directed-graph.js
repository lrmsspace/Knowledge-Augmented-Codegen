// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-visited-nodes-in-a-directed-graph/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a directed graph consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n directed edges.
//
// You are given a 0-indexed array edges where edges[i] indicates that there is an edge from node i to node edges[i].
//
// Consider the following process on the graph:
//
//
// 	You start from a node x and keep visiting other nodes through edges until you reach a node that you have already visited before on this same process.
//
//
// Return an array answer where answer[i] is the number of different nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node i.
//
// Example:
// Input: edges = [1,2,0,0]
// Output: [3,3,3,4]
// Explanation: We perform the process starting from each node in the following way:
// - Starting from node 0, we visit the nodes 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
// - Starting from node 1, we visit the nodes 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
// - Starting from node 2, we visit the nodes 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
// - Starting from node 3, we visit the nodes 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 4.
//
// Constraints:
// n == edges.length
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= edges[i] <= n - 1
// 	edges[i] != i
//

// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (array, sparse-table)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the lowest common ancestor of many pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It excels in scenarios with numerous queries after initial setup.
//   • Idea: This technique finds the LCA by transforming the problem into a Range Minimum Query (RMQ) on an Euler tour of the tree. It achieves O(N log N) precomputation time and O(1) query time.
//   • Invariants: The sparse_table[k][i] stores the minimum depth in the Euler tour array segment starting at index i and spanning 2^k elements.; The first_occurrence array correctly maps each node to its initial appearance index in the Euler tour.
//   • Tips: Perform an Euler tour (DFS traversal) to linearize the tree into an array of nodes and their depths.; Store the first occurrence index of each node in the Euler tour array.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when calculating range lengths or sparse table indices.; Incorrectly handling the Euler tour array, especially when mapping back to original nodes.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, matrix, matrix-exp, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count the number of paths of a specific length between all pairs of vertices in a graph, or to find reachability in a fixed number of steps.
//   • Idea: This algorithm leverages matrix exponentiation to find the number of paths of a fixed length `k` between all pairs of vertices in a graph. Each matrix multiplication step extends path lengths by one, resulting in an O(N^3 log K) time complexity for an N-vertex graph.
//   • Invariants: After `m` matrix multiplications, `C_m[i][j]` stores the number of paths of length `m` from `i` to `j`.; The initial adjacency matrix `G` remains constant throughout the exponentiation process.
//   • Tips: Represent the graph as an adjacency matrix where `G[i][j]` is the number of direct edges.; Matrix multiplication `C_k * G` yields `C_{k+1}` for path counts.
//   • Pitfalls: Standard matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to O(N^3 log K) overall time complexity.; Memory usage is O(N^2) for storing matrices, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
