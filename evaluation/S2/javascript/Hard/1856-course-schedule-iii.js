// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There are n different online courses numbered from 1 to n. You are given an array courses where courses[i] = [durationi, lastDayi] indicate that the ith course should be taken continuously for durationi days and must be finished before or on lastDayi.
//
// You will start on the 1st day and you cannot take two or more courses simultaneously.
//
// Return the maximum number of courses that you can take.
//
// Example:
// Input: courses = [[100,200],[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 
// There are totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
// First, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day.
// Second, take the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day. 
// Third, take the 2nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day. 
// The 4th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which exceeds the closed date.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= courses.length <= 104
// 	1 <= durationi, lastDayi <= 104
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (array, heap, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when given a set of tasks with deadlines and durations, and the objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks without interruption.
//   • Idea: This greedy algorithm aims to maximize the number of jobs completed by prioritizing tasks that finish earliest. It typically involves sorting and using a min-heap, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed up to the current point have been considered for scheduling.; The set of jobs in the heap represents the jobs currently scheduled to meet their deadlines.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by their deadlines in ascending order.; Maintain a min-heap of durations for jobs currently scheduled.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing job count maximization with total duration or profit.; Failing to update the current time correctly after scheduling a job.
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal ordering of non-contiguous elements.
//   • Idea: This DP approach calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in an array. It builds upon previously computed subsequence lengths, resulting in an O(N^2) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] stores the length of the LIS ending at index i.; For any j < i, if A[j] < A[i], then dp[j] + 1 is a candidate length for dp[i].
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element itself forms an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling the strict increasing condition (e.g., allowing equality).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
