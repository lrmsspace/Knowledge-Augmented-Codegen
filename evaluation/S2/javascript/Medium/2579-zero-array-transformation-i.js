//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri].
//
// For each queries[i]:
//
//
// 	Select a subset of indices within the range [li, ri] in nums.
// 	Decrement the values at the selected indices by 1.
//
//
// A Zero Array is an array where all elements are equal to 0.
//
// Return true if it is possible to transform nums into a Zero Array after processing all the queries sequentially, otherwise return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,0,1], queries = [[0,2]]
//
// Output: true
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	For i = 0:
//
// 	
// 		Select the subset of indices as [0, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
// 		The array will become [0, 0, 0], which is a Zero Array.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	queries[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= li <= ri < nums.length

// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It provides logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that can efficiently update individual elements and calculate prefix sums in an array. Both operations are performed in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each `tree[i]` element stores the sum of a contiguous range of elements from the original array, specifically from `i - (i & -i) + 1` to `i` (inclusive, 1-based).; After any `update(idx, val)` operation, `query(idx)` will reflect the new sum up to `idx`.
//   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for array elements to simplify bitwise logic; The `idx & -idx` operation is key to navigating the implicit tree structure
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-based and 1-based indexing can lead to incorrect results; Off-by-one errors when calculating range sums (e.g., `query(R) - query(L-1)`)
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
