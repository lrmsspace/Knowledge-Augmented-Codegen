// Problem Description:
// There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.
//
// You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:
//
//
// 	Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).
// 	A team is valid if: (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).
//
//
// Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).
//
// Example:
// Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1).
//
// Constraints:
// n == rating.length
// 	3 <= n <= 1000
// 	1 <= rating[i] <= 105
// 	All the integers in rating are unique.

// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total number of valid arrangements of opening and closing brackets, ensuring all pairs are matched and correctly nested. It applies to combinatorial problems requiring structured pairing.
//   • Idea: This technique counts the number of ways to form sequences of opening and closing brackets such that they are balanced and properly nested. It is a classic combinatorial problem, typically solved in O(N) or O(N^2) time.
//   • Invariants: At any point in sequence construction, the count of open brackets placed must be greater than or equal to the count of closed brackets placed.; The total number of open brackets in a complete valid sequence must exactly equal the total number of closed brackets.
//   • Tips: Recognize the connection to Catalan numbers for common variations (e.g., N pairs of parentheses).; Dynamic programming can solve more complex variations with different bracket types or constraints.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the 'prefix sum' condition: the count of open brackets must always be greater than or equal to close brackets at any point.; Incorrectly applying Catalan numbers to problems with additional constraints or different bracket types.
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - Ternary Search (interval, number, binary-search, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use Ternary Search to find the minimum or maximum of a unimodal or bitonic function over a continuous or discrete interval. It is effective when the function's derivative is hard to compute or unavailable.
//   • Idea: Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that repeatedly narrows down the search space for the extremum of a unimodal function by evaluating two points within the current interval. It reduces the search interval by one-third in each step, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function lies within the current interval [l, r].; The function value at m1 is compared with m2 to narrow the search.
//   • Tips: Ensure the function is strictly unimodal or bitonic within the search range.; Handle floating-point precision carefully for continuous functions.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying to non-unimodal functions yields incorrect results.; Floating-point errors can lead to incorrect bounds or infinite loops.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
