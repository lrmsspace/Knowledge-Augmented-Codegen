//
// Problem Description:
// There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) structure country network consisting of n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 roads. The capital city is city 0. You are given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.
//
// There is a meeting for the representatives of each city. The meeting is in the capital city.
//
// There is a car in each city. You are given an integer seats that indicates the number of seats in each car.
//
// A representative can use the car in their city to travel or change the car and ride with another representative. The cost of traveling between two cities is one liter of fuel.
//
// Return the minimum number of liters of fuel to reach the capital city.
//
// Example:
// Input: roads = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], seats = 5
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 
// - Representative1 goes directly to the capital with 1 liter of fuel.
// - Representative2 goes directly to the capital with 1 liter of fuel.
// - Representative3 goes directly to the capital with 1 liter of fuel.
// It costs 3 liters of fuel at minimum. 
// It can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of liters of fuel needed.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 	roads.length == n - 1
// 	roads[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ai, bi < n
// 	ai != bi
// 	roads represents a valid tree.
// 	1 <= seats <= 105

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Finding articulation points in a graph in O(N+M) (graph, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when identifying critical nodes whose removal would increase the number of connected components in an undirected graph. It's essential for analyzing network robustness and vulnerability.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all articulation points (cut vertices) in an undirected graph using a single Depth First Search traversal. It operates in linear time, O(N+M), where N is vertices and M is edges.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u`, `tin[u]` is its discovery time, and `low[u]` is initialized to `tin[u]`.; After visiting all children `v` of `u` (and their subtrees), `low[u]` will hold the minimum `tin` value reachable from `u` or its descendants via tree edges and at most one back-edge.
//   • Tips: Initialize `tin` (discovery time) and `low` (lowest reachable ancestor) arrays for all vertices.; The root of the DFS tree is an articulation point if it has more than one child in the DFS tree.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize `low[u]` with `tin[u]` before processing children.; Incorrectly applying the `tin[u] <= low[v]` condition to the root node of the DFS tree.
// - Minimum spanning tree - Prim's algorithm (graph, matrix, array, mst-prim, greedy)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a minimum spanning tree in a connected, weighted graph, especially efficient for dense graphs or when starting from an arbitrary vertex.
//   • Idea: Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that constructs a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by iteratively adding the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the growing tree to a vertex outside it. It typically runs in O(E log V) with a priority queue or O(V^2) with an adjacency matrix.
//   • Invariants: The set of edges chosen so far forms a tree (no cycles) and connects a subset of vertices.; At each step, the chosen edge is the minimum weight edge connecting a vertex in the current MST to a vertex outside it.
//   • Tips: Initialize distances (or minimum edge weights) for all vertices not in the MST to infinity.; Use a priority queue to efficiently retrieve the minimum weight edge connecting to the current MST.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly update edge weights to neighbors when a new vertex is added to the MST.; Not handling disconnected graphs, which will result in only an MST for the starting component.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
