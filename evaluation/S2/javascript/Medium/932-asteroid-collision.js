// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row. The indices of the asteriod in the array represent their relative position in space.
//
// For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
//
// Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
//
// Example:
// Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
// Output: [5,10]
// Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= asteroids.length <= 104
// 	-1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000
// 	asteroids[i] != 0
//

// - Minkowski sum of convex polygons (geometry, array, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to compute the sum of two convex polygons, or efficiently determine the minimum distance or intersection between them.
//   • Idea: The Minkowski sum of two convex polygons P and Q is a new convex polygon formed by vector addition of all points from P and Q. It can be computed in O(|P| + |Q|) time by merging their edge vectors.
//   • Invariants: The current edge added to the Minkowski sum is the one with the smallest angle among the remaining edges from both polygons.; The sequence of edges in the Minkowski sum maintains convexity.
//   • Tips: The vertices of P+Q are sums of vertices of P and Q.; The edges of P+Q are the edges of P and Q, sorted by angle.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like collinear edges or degenerate polygons.; Floating point precision issues in geometric calculations.
// - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to evaluate expressions given in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation) to compute their final numerical value.
//   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an expression in Reverse Polish Notation by processing elements sequentially. Numbers are pushed onto a stack, and operators pop two operands, compute, and push the result.
//   • Invariants: The stack always contains only numbers (operands or intermediate results).; For a valid RPN expression, the stack will have at least two elements when an operator is processed.
//   • Tips: Process the RPN expression from left to right, token by token.; Push numerical operands directly onto the stack.
//   • Pitfalls: Attempting to pop from an empty stack when an operator is encountered, indicating an invalid RPN expression.; Incorrect order of operands for non-commutative operations like subtraction or division.
// - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit or precompute primality for a range. It is efficient for generating primes within a reasonable upper bound.
//   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer by iteratively marking multiples of primes as composite. It achieves a time complexity of O(N log log N).
//   • Invariants: All numbers less than the current prime 'p' have already been processed.; If 'i' is marked as prime, then all its multiples less than 'i*i' have been marked composite by smaller primes.
//   • Tips: Optimize by starting inner loop from p*p, as smaller multiples would have been marked.; Use a boolean array for primality, or an integer array to store smallest prime factor (SPF).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0 and 1, which are neither prime nor composite.; Off-by-one errors when setting array bounds or loop conditions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
