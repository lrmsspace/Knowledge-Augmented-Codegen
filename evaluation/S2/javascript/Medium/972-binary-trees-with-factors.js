// Problem Description:
// Given an array of unique integers, arr, where each integer arr[i] is strictly greater than 1.
//
// We make a binary tree using these integers, and each number may be used for any number of times. Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of its children.
//
// Return the number of binary trees we can make. The answer may be too large so return the answer modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [2,4]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [4, 2, 2]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
// 	2 <= arr[i] <= 109
// 	All the values of arr are unique.

// - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, prefix-sum, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compute modular inverses for multiple numbers in an array or a range, especially when efficiency is critical, by leveraging prefix and suffix products to reduce inverse computations.
//   • Idea: This technique efficiently computes modular inverses for multiple numbers by transforming individual inverse calculations into a product of prefix, suffix, and a single overall inverse. It achieves O(N + log M) complexity for an array or O(M) for a range.
//   • Invariants: For 0 <= i < N, prefix_products[i] holds (arr[0] * ... * arr[i-1]) % m.; For 0 <= i < N, suffix_products[i] holds (arr[i+1] * ... * arr[N-1]) % m.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix products and suffix products of the array elements modulo m.; Calculate the modular inverse of the total product of all elements once using modular exponentiation.
//   • Pitfalls: Ensure all numbers for which an inverse is sought are coprime to the modulus m.; Watch for off-by-one errors when calculating prefix and suffix product indices.
// - Euler's totient function
//  (array, number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. It is also efficient for computing totient values for all numbers in a given range.
//   • Idea: Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. It can be computed for a single n in O(sqrt(n)) using prime factorization, or for all numbers up to N in O(N log log N) using a sieve-like algorithm.
//   • Invariants: phi[i] stores the current totient value for i, which is i initially, then updated by (1 - 1/p) for each prime p dividing i.; After iterating through all primes p up to sqrt(N), phi[i] holds the correct totient value for all i <= N.
//   • Tips: For a single n, compute φ(n) using its prime factorization.; For all φ(i) up to N, use a sieve approach similar to Sieve of Eratosthenes.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 'relatively prime' with 'prime number'.; Applying the multiplicative property incorrectly when numbers share common factors.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
