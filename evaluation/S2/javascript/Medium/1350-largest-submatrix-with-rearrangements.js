// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-submatrix-with-rearrangements/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a binary matrix matrix of size m x n, and you are allowed to rearrange the columns of the matrix in any order.
//
// Return the area of the largest submatrix within matrix where every element of the submatrix is 1 after reordering the columns optimally.
//
// Example:
// Input: matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
// The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 4.
//
// Constraints:
// m == matrix.length
// 	n == matrix[i].length
// 	1 <= m * n <= 105
// 	matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
//

// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, segment-tree, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence such that elements in the subsequence are in strictly increasing order, preserving their original relative order.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search or a segment tree.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or DP array) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index 'i', 'tails[i]' stores the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array where dp[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Binary search is used to find the correct position for the current element in the dp array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates for strictly increasing versus non-decreasing requirements.
// - Calculating the determinant of a matrix by Gauss (matrix, number, simulation, counting)
//   • When to use: When needing to compute the determinant of a square matrix, especially when Gaussian elimination is a familiar or efficient approach. It is suitable for matrices where direct cofactor expansion is computationally too expensive.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes the determinant of a square matrix by transforming it into an upper triangular form using Gaussian elimination. The determinant is the product of diagonal elements, adjusted by a sign factor from row swaps, with O(N^3) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Before processing column 'k', all elements A[i][j] where i > j and j < k are zero.; The determinant of the current matrix, multiplied by (-1)^swaps, equals the original matrix's determinant.
//   • Tips: Track the number of row swaps to correctly determine the determinant's sign.; Pivot selection can improve numerical stability, especially with floating-point numbers.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to adjust the sign after row exchanges.; Division by zero if a pivot element is zero, requiring a row swap.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
