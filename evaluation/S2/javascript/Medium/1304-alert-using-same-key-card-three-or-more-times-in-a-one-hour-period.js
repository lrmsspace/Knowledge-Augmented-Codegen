// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/alert-using-same-key-card-three-or-more-times-in-a-one-hour-period/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and the time when it was used. The system emits an alert if any worker uses the key-card three or more times in a one-hour period.
//
// You are given a list of strings keyName and keyTime where [keyName[i], keyTime[i]] corresponds to a person's name and the time when their key-card was used in a single day.
//
// Access times are given in the 24-hour time format "HH:MM", such as "23:51" and "09:49".
//
// Return a list of unique worker names who received an alert for frequent keycard use. Sort the names in ascending order alphabetically.
//
// Notice that "10:00" - "11:00" is considered to be within a one-hour period, while "22:51" - "23:52" is not considered to be within a one-hour period.
//
// Example:
// Input: keyName = ["daniel","daniel","daniel","luis","luis","luis","luis"], keyTime = ["10:00","10:40","11:00","09:00","11:00","13:00","15:00"]
// Output: ["daniel"]
// Explanation: "daniel" used the keycard 3 times in a one-hour period ("10:00","10:40", "11:00").
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= keyName.length, keyTime.length <= 105
// 	keyName.length == keyTime.length
// 	keyTime[i] is in the format "HH:MM".
// 	[keyName[i], keyTime[i]] is unique.
// 	1 <= keyName[i].length <= 10
// 	keyName[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - N/A
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
