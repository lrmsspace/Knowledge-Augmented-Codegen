// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-count-of-numbers-which-are-not-special/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given 2 positive integers l and r. For any number x, all positive divisors of x except x are called the proper divisors of x.
//
// A number is called special if it has exactly 2 proper divisors. For example:
//
//
// 	The number 4 is special because it has proper divisors 1 and 2.
// 	The number 6 is not special because it has proper divisors 1, 2, and 3.
//
//
// Return the count of numbers in the range [l, r] that are not special.
//
// Example:
// Input: l = 5, r = 7
//
// Output: 3
//
// Explanation:
//
// There are no special numbers in the range [5, 7].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= l <= r <= 109
//

// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to efficiently calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer. It is applicable in number theory problems or combinatorial tasks involving factors.
//   • Idea: This method computes the number of divisors and sum of divisors of an integer n by first finding its prime factorization. The core idea leverages properties of multiplicative functions, with a typical complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for factorization.
//   • Invariants: During prime factorization, temp_n always holds the remaining unfactored part of the original number.; The current_prime_factor iterates through potential prime divisors in increasing order.
//   • Tips: First find the prime factorization n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak.; Number of divisors d(n) = (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the special case of n=1 (1 divisor, sum 1).; Incorrectly calculating powers or sums, especially for large exponents.
// - The Stern-Brocot tree and Farey sequences (number, tree, binary-search, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this when representing positive rational numbers as unique paths in a binary tree or when efficiently approximating irrational numbers. It's ideal for finding a fraction's path or its position within ordered sequences.
//   • Idea: The Stern-Brocot tree uniquely maps every positive rational number to a binary path, constructed by repeatedly taking mediants. This allows for efficient search and representation of fractions with O(log(p+q)) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The target fraction p/q always lies strictly between the current left boundary pL/qL and right boundary pR/qR.; The current left and right boundary fractions (pL/qL, pR/qR) are always adjacent terms in some Farey sequence.
//   • Tips: Initialize search boundaries with 0/1 and 1/0 (or 1/1 for positive fractions).; Calculate the mediant (pL+pR)/(qL+qR) to determine the next candidate fraction.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive O(p+q) search without run-length encoding can be too slow for large fractions.; Incorrectly handling initial boundary conditions (e.g., 0/1, 1/0, 1/1).
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
