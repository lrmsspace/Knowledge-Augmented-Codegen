// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-level-sum-of-a-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.
//
// Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 
// Level 1 sum = 1.
// Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
// Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
// So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// 	-105 <= Node.val <= 105
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Heavy-light decomposition (tree, array, dfs, divide-and-conquer, tree-dp)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently perform path queries or updates on a tree, transforming tree paths into linear segments for data structures like segment trees.
//   • Idea: Heavy-light decomposition partitions a tree into disjoint heavy paths, ensuring any root-to-node path crosses at most O(log N) heavy paths. This reduces tree path queries to segment operations, typically achieving O(log^2 N) or O(log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Every node is part of exactly one heavy path.; Traversing from any node to the root involves at most O(log N) heavy path switches.
//   • Tips: Precompute subtree sizes for all nodes to identify heavy edges.; Map heavy paths to contiguous array segments for efficient range queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Misidentifying heavy edges or having more than one heavy child per node.; Off-by-one errors when converting tree path segments to array indices.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
