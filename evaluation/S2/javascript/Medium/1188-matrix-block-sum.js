// Problem Description:
// Given a m x n matrix mat and an integer k, return a matrix answer where each answer[i][j] is the sum of all elements mat[r][c] for:
//
//
// 	i - k <= r <= i + k,
// 	j - k <= c <= j + k, and
// 	(r, c) is a valid position in the matrix.
//
// Example:
// Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 1
// Output: [[12,21,16],[27,45,33],[24,39,28]]
//
// Constraints:
// m == mat.length
// 	n == mat[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n, k <= 100
// 	1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Operations on polynomials and series (array, recursion)
//   • When to use: Apply when multiplying polynomials or combining two sequences where the resulting element's index is the sum of indices from the original sequences. This is typically for enumerative counting problems.
//   • Idea: Convolution computes the coefficients of the product of two polynomials or series by summing products of coefficients whose indices add up to the target index. A direct computation has a time complexity of O(N*M).
//   • Invariants: For any k, c_k correctly represents the coefficient of x^k in the product polynomial.; The sum i + (k-i) always equals k for each term contributing to c_k.
//   • Tips: Understand the index relationship: c_k = sum(a_i * b_{k-i}) for all valid i.; Handle array bounds carefully for both input sequences and the result.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in loop bounds for indices i and k-i.; Incorrectly determining the size of the result array (should be n+m+1 elements for degrees n and m).
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
