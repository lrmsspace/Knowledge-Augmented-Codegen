// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-make-array-complementary/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums of even length n and an integer limit. In one move, you can replace any integer from nums with another integer between 1 and limit, inclusive.
//
// The array nums is complementary if for all indices i (0-indexed), nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] equals the same number. For example, the array [1,2,3,4] is complementary because for all indices i, nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] = 5.
//
// Return the minimum number of moves required to make nums complementary.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,4,3], limit = 4
// Output: 1
// Explanation: In 1 move, you can change nums to [1,2,2,3] (underlined elements are changed).
// nums[0] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 = 4.
// nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 2 = 4.
// nums[2] + nums[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.
// nums[3] + nums[0] = 3 + 1 = 4.
// Therefore, nums[i] + nums[n-1-i] = 4 for every i, so nums is complementary.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= limit <= 105
// 	n is even.

// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
// - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
//   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
//   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).
// - Range Minimum Query (array, sparse-table)
//   • When to use: When performing many range minimum queries on a static array, especially when query time needs to be logarithmic after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes minimums for all possible ranges of power-of-two lengths, allowing O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing. It efficiently answers range minimum queries on an immutable array.
//   • Invariants: For any `j`, `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum value in the segment starting at `i` with length `2^j`.; The `log_table[k]` stores `floor(log2(k))` for efficient length calculation.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values or use `std::log2` for efficient length calculations.; The `dp[i][j]` entry stores the minimum in the range `[i, i + 2^j - 1]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to the array elements; it's for static data only.; Higher memory consumption compared to some other range query structures.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
