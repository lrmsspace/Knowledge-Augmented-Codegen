// Problem Description:
// You are the owner of a company that creates alloys using various types of metals. There are n different types of metals available, and you have access to k machines that can be used to create alloys. Each machine requires a specific amount of each metal type to create an alloy.
//
// For the ith machine to create an alloy, it needs composition[i][j] units of metal of type j. Initially, you have stock[i] units of metal type i, and purchasing one unit of metal type i costs cost[i] coins.
//
// Given integers n, k, budget, a 1-indexed 2D array composition, and 1-indexed arrays stock and cost, your goal is to maximize the number of alloys the company can create while staying within the budget of budget coins.
//
// All alloys must be created with the same machine.
//
// Return the maximum number of alloys that the company can create.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, k = 2, budget = 15, composition = [[1,1,1],[1,1,10]], stock = [0,0,0], cost = [1,2,3]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: It is optimal to use the 1st machine to create alloys.
// To create 2 alloys we need to buy the:
// - 2 units of metal of the 1st type.
// - 2 units of metal of the 2nd type.
// - 2 units of metal of the 3rd type.
// In total, we need 2 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 3 = 12 coins, which is smaller than or equal to budget = 15.
// Notice that we have 0 units of metal of each type and we have to buy all the required units of metal.
// It can be proven that we can create at most 2 alloys.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n, k <= 100
// 	0 <= budget <= 108
// 	composition.length == k
// 	composition[i].length == n
// 	1 <= composition[i][j] <= 100
// 	stock.length == cost.length == n
// 	0 <= stock[i] <= 108
// 	1 <= cost[i] <= 100

// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
// - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, recursion, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when an exhaustive list of all subsets of a specific size K from a set of N items is required. It's suitable for problems needing to explore every possible configuration of K elements.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique subsets of size K from a set of N distinct elements, commonly employing recursion or bit manipulation. The typical time complexity is O(N choose K * K) for construction or O(N choose K) if just iterating.
//   • Invariants: The current partial combination always contains unique elements.; The number of elements chosen so far does not exceed K.
//   • Tips: Employ backtracking or recursion for a straightforward implementation.; Utilize bitmasks for efficient representation and generation, especially for smaller N.
//   • Pitfalls: Accidentally generating duplicate combinations if elements are not handled uniquely.; Failing to correctly define base cases or termination conditions for recursive calls.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
