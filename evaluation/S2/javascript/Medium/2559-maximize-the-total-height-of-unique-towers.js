// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-total-height-of-unique-towers/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array maximumHeight, where maximumHeight[i] denotes the maximum height the ith tower can be assigned.
//
// Your task is to assign a height to each tower so that:
//
//
// 	The height of the ith tower is a positive integer and does not exceed maximumHeight[i].
// 	No two towers have the same height.
//
//
// Return the maximum possible total sum of the tower heights. If it's not possible to assign heights, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: maximumHeight = [2,3,4,3]
//
// Output: 10
//
// Explanation:
//
// We can assign heights in the following way: [1, 2, 4, 3].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= maximumHeight.length <= 105
// 	1 <= maximumHeight[i] <= 109

// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, coordinate-compress, segment-tree, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements must be strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal substructure on sequences with an increasing property.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are in increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree with coordinate compression.
//   • Invariants: The `dp` array (or segment tree) stores information about the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The `dp` array, if used, remains sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) solution uses a `dp` array storing the smallest ending element for all increasing subsequences of a given length.; Binary search (`lower_bound`) efficiently finds the correct position to update in the `dp` array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates; LIS typically requires strictly increasing elements.
// - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in order. It is efficient for both convex and non-convex polygons.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing signed trapezoidal areas formed by each edge and the x-axis, or equivalently, using the shoelace formula. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of vertices.
//   • Invariants: Vertices are processed sequentially in their given order, forming edges.; The running sum `current_sum` accumulates the signed contribution from each edge processed so far.
//   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in a consistent order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; Use a data type with sufficient range (e.g., long long or double) for intermediate sums to prevent overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect vertex order will result in an incorrect signed area or even zero.; Integer overflow can occur if coordinates are large and sums exceed standard integer limits.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
