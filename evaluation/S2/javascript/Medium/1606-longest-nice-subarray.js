// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-nice-subarray/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.
//
// We call a subarray of nums nice if the bitwise AND of every pair of elements that are in different positions in the subarray is equal to 0.
//
// Return the length of the longest nice subarray.
//
// A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
//
// Note that subarrays of length 1 are always considered nice.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,3,8,48,10]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The longest nice subarray is [3,8,48]. This subarray satisfies the conditions:
// - 3 AND 8 = 0.
// - 3 AND 48 = 0.
// - 8 AND 48 = 0.
// It can be proven that no longer nice subarray can be obtained, so we return 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (array, stack, monotonic-stack, max-window)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to find the largest rectangular submatrix composed entirely of zeros within a binary matrix. It efficiently reduces the 2D problem to a series of 1D largest rectangle in histogram problems.
//   • Idea: The algorithm transforms a 2D matrix problem into a series of 1D 'largest rectangle in histogram' problems, one for each row. It uses a monotonic stack to find the nearest smaller elements for each bar in O(N) time, leading to an overall O(N*M) complexity for the 2D problem.
//   • Invariants: The stack always stores indices of elements in strictly increasing order of their corresponding heights.; When an element is popped from the stack, the element below it is its nearest smaller element to the left.
//   • Tips: Precompute heights for each column, representing consecutive zeros upwards from the current row.; The 2D problem is effectively reduced to finding the largest rectangle in a histogram for each row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when using the stack (e.g., empty stack, end of array).; Off-by-one errors when calculating the width of the rectangle (k2 - k1 - 1).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
