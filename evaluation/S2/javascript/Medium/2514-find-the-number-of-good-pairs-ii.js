// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-good-pairs-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given 2 integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of lengths n and m respectively. You are also given a positive integer k.
//
// A pair (i, j) is called good if nums1[i] is divisible by nums2[j] * k (0 <= i <= n - 1, 0 <= j <= m - 1).
//
// Return the total number of good pairs.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [1,3,4], nums2 = [1,3,4], k = 1
//
// Output: 5
//
// Explanation:
// The 5 good pairs are (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), and (2, 2).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n, m <= 105
// 	1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 106
// 	1 <= k <= 103

// - Binomial Coefficients (array, number, dp-1d, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating binomial coefficients C(n, k) modulo a composite number M, especially when M is not prime and direct modular inverse computation for factorials is not possible.
//   • Idea: This technique computes binomial coefficients modulo an arbitrary composite number M by factoring M into prime powers. For each prime power, it calculates prime exponents in factorials and combines coprime parts, then uses Chinese Remainder Theorem.
//   • Invariants: For any `i <= N`, `c[i]` correctly stores the exponent of prime `p` in `i!`.; For any `i <= N`, `g[i]` correctly stores `(i! / p^c[i]) % (p^b)`.
//   • Tips: Precompute factorials and their prime exponents up to N using dynamic programming.; Apply Legendre's formula to efficiently find the exponent of a prime 'p' in 'x!'.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly factorize the modulus 'M' into its prime power components.; Incorrectly computing modular inverses when a number is not coprime to the modulus.
// -  
// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
