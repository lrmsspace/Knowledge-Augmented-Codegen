//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a sorted array nums of n non-negative integers and an integer maximumBit. You want to perform the following query n times:
//
//
// 	Find a non-negative integer k < 2maximumBit such that nums[0] XOR nums[1] XOR ... XOR nums[nums.length-1] XOR k is maximized. k is the answer to the ith query.
// 	Remove the last element from the current array nums.
//
//
// Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [0,1,1,3], maximumBit = 2
// Output: [0,3,2,3]
// Explanation: The queries are answered as follows:
// 1st query: nums = [0,1,1,3], k = 0 since 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 3.
// 2nd query: nums = [0,1,1], k = 3 since 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 3.
// 3rd query: nums = [0,1], k = 2 since 0 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 3.
// 4th query: nums = [0], k = 3 since 0 XOR 3 = 3.
//
// Constraints:
// nums.length == n
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= maximumBit <= 20
// 	0 <= nums[i] < 2maximumBit
// 	nums​​​ is sorted in ascending order.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Sqrt Tree (array, tree, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to perform O(1) range queries and support efficient updates (single element or range) on an array, leveraging a hierarchical decomposition.
//   • Idea: A Sqrt Tree is a data structure that supports O(1) range queries and efficient updates on an array. It recursively decomposes the array into blocks and layers, using precomputed information and bitwise operations to quickly answer queries and propagate updates.
//   • Invariants: Each element is part of exactly one block at each layer of the Sqrt Tree.; The highest differing bit between `l` and `r` identifies the specific layer for processing `q(l, r)`.
//   • Tips: Precompute highest bit for efficient layer selection.; Decompose queries into intra-block and inter-block segments.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive updates can result in O(N) complexity per update.; High memory consumption due to multiple layers of precomputed arrays.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Gray code (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
//   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
//   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
