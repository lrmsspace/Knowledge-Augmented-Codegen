// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-prime-factors-of-product-of-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of positive integers nums, return the number of distinct prime factors in the product of the elements of nums.
//
// Note that:
//
//
// 	A number greater than 1 is called prime if it is divisible by only 1 and itself.
// 	An integer val1 is a factor of another integer val2 if val2 / val1 is an integer.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,4,3,7,10,6]
// Output: 4
// Explanation:
// The product of all the elements in nums is: 2 * 4 * 3 * 7 * 10 * 6 = 10080 = 25 * 32 * 5 * 7.
// There are 4 distinct prime factors so we return 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 104
// 	2 <= nums[i] <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Euler's totient function
//  (array, number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. It is also efficient for computing totient values for all numbers in a given range.
//   • Idea: Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. It can be computed for a single n in O(sqrt(n)) using prime factorization, or for all numbers up to N in O(N log log N) using a sieve-like algorithm.
//   • Invariants: phi[i] stores the current totient value for i, which is i initially, then updated by (1 - 1/p) for each prime p dividing i.; After iterating through all primes p up to sqrt(N), phi[i] holds the correct totient value for all i <= N.
//   • Tips: For a single n, compute φ(n) using its prime factorization.; For all φ(i) up to N, use a sieve approach similar to Sieve of Eratosthenes.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 'relatively prime' with 'prime number'.; Applying the multiplicative property incorrectly when numbers share common factors.
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer, typically by leveraging its prime factorization.
//   • Idea: The number of divisors d(n) and sum of divisors sigma(n) are arithmetic functions derived from the prime factorization of an integer n. Both can be computed efficiently by first finding prime factors and their exponents, resulting in an O(sqrt(N)) or O(log N) complexity with precomputed primes.
//   • Invariants: The current count of divisors is the product of (exponent + 1) for all prime factors found so far.; The current sum of divisors is the product of (1 + p + ... + p^e) for all prime factors found so far.
//   • Tips: Precompute primes using a sieve for efficiency when dealing with multiple queries or large numbers.; For sum of divisors, the formula is sigma(n) = product((1 + p_i + ... + p_i^e_i)) for each prime factor p_i^e_i.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle n=1 correctly, which has one divisor.; Integer overflow when calculating sums or products of large powers, especially for sum of divisors.
// - Binomial Coefficients (array, number, dp-1d, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating binomial coefficients C(n, k) modulo a composite number M, especially when M is not prime and direct modular inverse computation for factorials is not possible.
//   • Idea: This technique computes binomial coefficients modulo an arbitrary composite number M by factoring M into prime powers. For each prime power, it calculates prime exponents in factorials and combines coprime parts, then uses Chinese Remainder Theorem.
//   • Invariants: For any `i <= N`, `c[i]` correctly stores the exponent of prime `p` in `i!`.; For any `i <= N`, `g[i]` correctly stores `(i! / p^c[i]) % (p^b)`.
//   • Tips: Precompute factorials and their prime exponents up to N using dynamic programming.; Apply Legendre's formula to efficiently find the exponent of a prime 'p' in 'x!'.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly factorize the modulus 'M' into its prime power components.; Incorrectly computing modular inverses when a number is not coprime to the modulus.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
