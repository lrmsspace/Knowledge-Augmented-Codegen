// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unreachable-pairs-of-nodes-in-an-undirected-graph/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.
//
// Return the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: There are no pairs of nodes that are unreachable from each other. Therefore, we return 0.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 105
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ai, bi < n
// 	ai != bi
// 	There are no repeated edges.

// - Finding Bridges Online (graph, ds, union-find, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when edges are added one by one to an initially empty graph and you need to efficiently track the number of bridges or 2-edge-connected components after each addition.
//   • Idea: This algorithm dynamically maintains the number of bridges in an undirected graph as edges are added incrementally. It leverages a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to achieve an amortized time complexity of O((N+M) log N).
//   • Invariants: Each DSU set represents a 2-edge-connected component or a collection of such components connected by bridges.; The total count of bridges accurately reflects edges whose removal increases connected components.
//   • Tips: Understand the properties of 2-edge-connected components and how they relate to bridges.; Carefully manage DSU operations, including path compression and union by rank/size, for optimal performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating the bridge count after an edge addition, especially when cycles are formed.; Inefficient DSU operations leading to a higher than expected time complexity.
// - Undirected Graphs (graph, matrix, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when modeling symmetric relationships between entities, analyzing graph properties like connectivity or degrees, or simulating processes on a network where connections are bidirectional.
//   • Idea: An undirected graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges, where each edge connects two vertices symmetrically. Basic operations often have a time complexity of O(V+E) or O(V^2) depending on representation.
//   • Invariants: For every edge (u, v) in the graph, the edge (v, u) also exists.; The sum of degrees of all vertices equals twice the number of edges.
//   • Tips: Choose adjacency list for sparse graphs, adjacency matrix for dense graphs.; Degrees of vertices are easily calculated from adjacency representations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to add both (u,v) and (v,u) when using an adjacency matrix or list.; Not handling disconnected components during full graph traversals.
// - Counting labeled graphs (number, dp-2d, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: When counting the total number of labeled graphs with a specific number of vertices and connected components. Useful for problems requiring enumeration of graph structures based on their connectivity properties.
//   • Idea: This technique uses dynamic programming to count labeled graphs with a given number of vertices and connected components by building up solutions from smaller subproblems. It leverages a recurrence relation that considers the component containing a specific vertex, leading to an O(N^2 * K) time complexity for N vertices and K components.
//   • Invariants: D[i][j] correctly stores the number of labeled graphs with i vertices and j components.; All C_s values for s < n are correctly precomputed before calculating D[n][k].
//   • Tips: Precompute binomial coefficients for efficiency.; Precompute the number of connected graphs (C_s) for all relevant s.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for the dynamic programming table.; Off-by-one errors in binomial coefficient calculations or array indexing.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
