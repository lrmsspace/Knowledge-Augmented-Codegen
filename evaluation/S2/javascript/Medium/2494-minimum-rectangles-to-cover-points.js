// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-rectangles-to-cover-points/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. You are also given an integer w. Your task is to cover all the given points with rectangles.
//
// Each rectangle has its lower end at some point (x1, 0) and its upper end at some point (x2, y2), where x1 <= x2, y2 >= 0, and the condition x2 - x1 <= w must be satisfied for each rectangle.
//
// A point is considered covered by a rectangle if it lies within or on the boundary of the rectangle.
//
// Return an integer denoting the minimum number of rectangles needed so that each point is covered by at least one rectangle.
//
// Note: A point may be covered by more than one rectangle.
//
// Example:
// Input: points = [[2,1],[1,0],[1,4],[1,8],[3,5],[4,6]], w = 1
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation: 
//
// The image above shows one possible placement of rectangles to cover the points:
//
//
// 	A rectangle with a lower end at (1, 0) and its upper end at (2, 8)
// 	A rectangle with a lower end at (3, 0) and its upper end at (4, 8)
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= points.length <= 105
// 	points[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= xi == points[i][0] <= 109
// 	0 <= yi == points[i][1] <= 109
// 	0 <= w <= 109
// 	All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.

// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - Manhattan Distance (geometry, graph, sweep-line, mst-kruskal, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use this when finding the Minimum Spanning Tree for points in a 2D plane where edge weights are Manhattan distances, or when a geometric problem can be simplified by transforming Manhattan to Chebyshev distance.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Tree for points in a 2D plane using Manhattan distance. It leverages a sweep-line approach to efficiently find nearest neighbors in specific octants, reducing the number of candidate edges for Kruskal's algorithm, achieving O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any point 's' in the active set, its nearest neighbor in the current octant has not yet been processed.; Points are processed in non-decreasing order of 'x + y' (or transformed coordinate), ensuring local optimality for distances.
//   • Tips: Consider transforming Manhattan distance problems into Chebyshev distance problems using (x+y, y-x) coordinates.; Divide the plane into 8 octants around each point to simplify nearest neighbor searches.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining or handling the 8 octants, especially near boundaries or for points with equal coordinates.; Inefficiently managing the 'active set' during the sweep-line, leading to higher than O(N log N) complexity.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
