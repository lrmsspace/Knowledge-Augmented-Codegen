// Problem Description:
// An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
//
//
// 	For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.
//
//
// Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.
//
// A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
// 	-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
//

// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Catalan Numbers (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when counting arrangements of objects that follow a specific non-crossing or balancing rule, often involving recursive decomposition or paths constrained by a diagonal.
//   • Idea: Catalan numbers count the number of ways to arrange certain combinatorial objects, such as balanced parentheses sequences or monotonic paths that do not cross a diagonal. They can be computed using a recurrence relation (O(N^2) with DP) or a direct binomial coefficient formula (O(N) or O(N log N)).
//   • Invariants: dp[i] stores the i-th Catalan number, correctly computed from dp[0] through dp[i-1].; For each n, the sum sum(dp[k] * dp[n-1-k]) iterates through all valid partitions of the problem.
//   • Tips: Memoize the recursive solution to avoid redundant computations, transforming it into dynamic programming.; For large N, use modular arithmetic if results are required modulo a prime to prevent integer overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to correctly handle the base cases, typically C0 = 1 and C1 = 1.; Encountering integer overflow when calculating large binomial coefficients without appropriate modular arithmetic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
