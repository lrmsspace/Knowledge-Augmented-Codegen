//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array nums comprising of n non-negative integers.
//
// In one operation, you must:
//
//
// 	Choose an integer i such that 1 <= i < n and nums[i] > 0.
// 	Decrease nums[i] by 1.
// 	Increase nums[i - 1] by 1.
//
//
// Return the minimum possible value of the maximum integer of nums after performing any number of operations.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,7,1,6]
// Output: 5
// Explanation:
// One set of optimal operations is as follows:
// 1. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes [4,6,1,6].
// 2. Choose i = 3, and nums becomes [4,6,2,5].
// 3. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes [5,5,2,5].
// The maximum integer of nums is 5. It can be shown that the maximum number cannot be less than 5.
// Therefore, we return 5.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 109

// - Maximum flow - Push-relabel method improved (graph, array, greedy, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this for maximum flow problems on graphs where an optimized push-relabel approach is required. It improves performance by prioritizing vertices with the greatest height for push and relabel operations.
//   • Idea: This algorithm is an optimized variant of the push-relabel maximum flow method, which improves efficiency by always selecting the vertex with the greatest height that has excess flow. This specific vertex selection strategy leads to a better theoretical time complexity, typically O(V^2 * sqrt(E)) or O(V^3) depending on implementation details.
//   • Invariants: For any edge (u, v) in the residual graph, h(u) <= h(v) + 1.; The total excess flow in the network is always non-negative.
//   • Tips: Always select the active vertex with the highest current height.; Maintain a data structure (e.g., buckets or lists) to quickly find highest-height vertices.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly managing the list of highest-height vertices.; Failing to update residual capacities after a push operation.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
