//
// Problem Description:
// You are given three positive integers: n, index, and maxSum. You want to construct an array nums (0-indexed) that satisfies the following conditions:
//
//
// 	nums.length == n
// 	nums[i] is a positive integer where 0 <= i < n.
// 	abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1]) <= 1 where 0 <= i < n-1.
// 	The sum of all the elements of nums does not exceed maxSum.
// 	nums[index] is maximized.
//
//
// Return nums[index] of the constructed array.
//
// Note that abs(x) equals x if x >= 0, and -x otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, index = 2,  maxSum = 6
// Output: 2
// Explanation: nums = [1,2,2,1] is one array that satisfies all the conditions.
// There are no arrays that satisfy all the conditions and have nums[2] == 3, so 2 is the maximum nums[2].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= maxSum <= 109
// 	0 <= index < n
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, quickselect, randomized)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently find the k-th smallest or largest element in an unsorted array without fully sorting it, especially when average-case linear time complexity is acceptable and in-place modification is desired.
//   • Idea: QuickSelect is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot and recursively searches for the k-th element in the relevant partition. It offers an average-case O(N) time complexity and O(1) space.
//   • Invariants: The pivot element is always placed at its correct sorted position within the current sub-array.; All elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to it, and all elements to its right are greater than or equal to it.
//   • Tips: Randomly select pivots to ensure average-case O(N) performance and avoid worst-case scenarios.; Adjust the target index k based on whether you're seeking the k-th smallest or k-th largest element.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case O(N^2) time complexity, though rare with randomization.; Off-by-one errors are common when mapping k-th largest/smallest to 0-indexed array positions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
