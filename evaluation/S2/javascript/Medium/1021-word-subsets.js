// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.
//
// A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.
//
//
// 	For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".
//
//
// A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.
//
// Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
//
// Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 104
// 	1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10
// 	words1[i] and words2[i] consist only of lowercase English letters.
// 	All the strings of words1 are unique.

// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (trie, queue, bitset, aho-corasick, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when searching for multiple patterns simultaneously within a larger text. It is highly efficient for finding all occurrences of a dictionary of keywords.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a set of patterns, allowing efficient simultaneous searching for all patterns in a text. It typically achieves O(N + M + K) time complexity, where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: All patterns in the dictionary are correctly represented as paths in the trie structure.; For any state `s`, its failure link `fail[s]` points to the longest proper prefix of the string represented by `s` that is also a suffix of `s` and exists in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, representing each pattern as a path.; Use BFS to construct failure links, pointing to the longest proper prefix of the current state's string that is also a suffix.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; High memory usage if the pattern set is very large or patterns are excessively long.
// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
