//
// Problem Description:
// Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a string array board, return true if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.
//
// The board is a 3 x 3 array that consists of characters ' ', 'X', and 'O'. The ' ' character represents an empty square.
//
// Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
//
//
// 	Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
// 	The first player always places 'X' characters, while the second player always places 'O' characters.
// 	'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
// 	The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
// 	The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
// 	No more moves can be played if the game is over.
//
// Example:
// Input: board = ["O  ","   ","   "]
// Output: false
// Explanation: The first player always plays "X".
//
// Constraints:
// board.length == 3
// 	board[i].length == 3
// 	board[i][j] is either 'X', 'O', or ' '.

// - Sprague-Grundy theorem. Nim (array, number, game-theory, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when analyzing impartial games with perfect information and no draws, especially to determine winning/losing states or to find a winning strategy. It's particularly useful for games that can be reduced to Nim.
//   • Idea: The Sprague-Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a Nim pile of a certain size (its nim-value or grundy number). For Nim, a position is a winning position if and only if the XOR sum of all pile sizes is non-zero, allowing for O(N) classification.
//   • Invariants: The XOR sum of the pile sizes (nim-sum) represents the game's current nim-value.; If the nim-sum is zero, any valid move will result in a non-zero nim-sum for the opponent.
//   • Tips: Understand the definition of impartial games and their properties.; Calculate the XOR sum of game components to determine the nim-sum.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing impartial games with partisan games where players have different moves.; Incorrectly calculating the XOR sum, leading to wrong state classifications.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
//   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
//   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.
// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
