// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-weak-characters-in-the-game/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has two main properties: attack and defense. You are given a 2D integer array properties where properties[i] = [attacki, defensei] represents the properties of the ith character in the game.
//
// A character is said to be weak if any other character has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character i is said to be weak if there exists another character j where attackj > attacki and defensej > defensei.
//
// Return the number of weak characters.
//
// Example:
// Input: properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: No character has strictly greater attack and defense than the other.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= properties.length <= 105
// 	properties[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= attacki, defensei <= 105

// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, counting, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when counting non-attacking piece placements on a grid, especially when the problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems based on board properties like diagonals.
//   • Idea: This algorithm employs 2D dynamic programming to count the total number of ways to place non-attacking bishops on a chessboard. It leverages the independence of placements on black and white squares/diagonals, achieving a polynomial time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any diagonal `i`, `D[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonal `i`.; Bishops placed on black diagonals do not attack bishops placed on white diagonals.
//   • Tips: Decompose the problem into independent subproblems for black and white squares/diagonals.; Identify the state for DP, typically `dp[diagonal_index][bishops_placed]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the number of squares on each diagonal.; Overlapping bishops if diagonal definitions are not precise.
// - Search for a pair of intersecting segments (geometry, enumeration, sweep-line)
//   • When to use: When needing to efficiently detect if any two line segments among a given set intersect, or to find one such intersecting pair.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently determines if any two line segments in a given set intersect by processing events along a sweep line, typically achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All segments fully to the left of the sweep line have been processed and do not intersect each other.; The active set contains all segments currently intersecting the sweep line, ordered by their y-coordinate.
//   • Tips: Represent segments by their endpoints as event points, sorted by x-coordinate.; Use a balanced binary search tree (or similar structure) to maintain active segments ordered by their y-coordinate at the sweep line.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect intersection detection or ordering.; Degenerate cases like collinear segments or multiple segments intersecting at a single point.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
