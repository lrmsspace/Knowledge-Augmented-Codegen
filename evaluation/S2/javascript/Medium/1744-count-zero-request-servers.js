//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n denoting the total number of servers and a 2D 0-indexed integer array logs, where logs[i] = [server_id, time] denotes that the server with id server_id received a request at time time.
//
// You are also given an integer x and a 0-indexed integer array queries.
//
// Return a 0-indexed integer array arr of length queries.length where arr[i] represents the number of servers that did not receive any requests during the time interval [queries[i] - x, queries[i]].
//
// Note that the time intervals are inclusive.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, logs = [[1,3],[2,6],[1,5]], x = 5, queries = [10,11]
// Output: [1,2]
// Explanation: 
// For queries[0]: The servers with ids 1 and 2 get requests in the duration of [5, 10]. Hence, only server 3 gets zero requests.
// For queries[1]: Only the server with id 2 gets a request in duration of [6,11]. Hence, the servers with ids 1 and 3 are the only servers that do not receive any requests during that time period.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= logs.length <= 105
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	logs[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= logs[i][0] <= n
// 	1 <= logs[i][1] <= 106
// 	1 <= x <= 105
// 	x < queries[i] <= 106

// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, number, sparse-table, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries on a static array in O(1) time, after an initial O(N log N) preprocessing phase. It is particularly efficient for associative operations like sum, min, or max.
//   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes results for all possible range queries on a static array using a hierarchical block decomposition. It achieves O(N log N) construction time and space complexity, enabling O(1) query time for associative operations.
//   • Invariants: ST[k][i] stores the result for a range of length 2^k starting at i within its block.; For any level k, blocks are disjoint, but ranges within ST[k] can overlap with ranges in ST[k-1].
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values or highest set bit for efficient level determination.; Ensure the operation (e.g., sum, min, max) is associative for correct combination.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for arrays that require updates, as it's a static data structure.; Only works for associative operations; non-associative operations cannot be combined this way.
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (tree, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently find the MEX of a sequence after multiple point updates, where the sequence elements are non-negative integers.
//   • Idea: This approach uses a segment tree or similar data structure to maintain counts of elements, allowing efficient O(log N) updates and O(log N) queries for the minimal excluded number (MEX). The core idea is to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sequence.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree correctly stores the count of distinct numbers within its represented range.; The MEX query always explores the leftmost child first if its range is not 'full' (i.e., missing elements).
//   • Tips: Build the tree over the range of possible non-negative integer values, typically up to N or a maximum constraint.; Each tree node should store the count of distinct numbers present within its represented range.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle numbers larger than the maximum range covered by the segment tree.; Incorrectly updating counts for elements, leading to stale or erroneous MEX values.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
