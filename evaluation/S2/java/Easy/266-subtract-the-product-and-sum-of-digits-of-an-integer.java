//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 234
// Output: 15 
// Explanation: 
// Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
// Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 
// Result = 24 - 9 = 15
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 10^5
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Gray code (number, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when a sequence of binary numbers is needed where successive values differ by only one bit. This is useful for error detection in digital systems or position encoders.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit position. Conversion from a binary number `n` to its Gray code `G(n)` is `n ^ (n >> 1)`, and the inverse operation can also be performed efficiently in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: For binary to Gray: The resulting Gray code `G(n)` differs from `n` by exactly one bit for each `n`.; For inverse Gray to binary: The variable `n` accumulates the correct binary value from MSB to LSB.
//   • Tips: Understand the core `n ^ (n >> 1)` transformation for binary to Gray.; The inverse Gray code conversion involves iteratively XORing with right-shifted values.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation.; Incorrectly implementing the iterative inverse transformation logic.
// - Calculating the determinant of a matrix by Gauss (matrix, number, simulation, counting)
//   • When to use: When needing to compute the determinant of a square matrix, especially when Gaussian elimination is a familiar or efficient approach. It is suitable for matrices where direct cofactor expansion is computationally too expensive.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes the determinant of a square matrix by transforming it into an upper triangular form using Gaussian elimination. The determinant is the product of diagonal elements, adjusted by a sign factor from row swaps, with O(N^3) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Before processing column 'k', all elements A[i][j] where i > j and j < k are zero.; The determinant of the current matrix, multiplied by (-1)^swaps, equals the original matrix's determinant.
//   • Tips: Track the number of row swaps to correctly determine the determinant's sign.; Pivot selection can improve numerical stability, especially with floating-point numbers.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to adjust the sign after row exchanges.; Division by zero if a pivot element is zero, requiring a row swap.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    public int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {

        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            product *= digit;
            sum += digit;
            n /= 10;
