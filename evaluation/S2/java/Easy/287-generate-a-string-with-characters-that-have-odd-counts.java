//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer n, return a string with n characters such that each character in such string occurs an odd number of times.
//
// The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return any of them.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4
// Output: "pppz"
// Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 500
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring within a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity for this task.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all maximal palindromic substrings centered at each position in a string by leveraging symmetry and previously computed results. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: d_odd[i] stores the radius of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.; The (l, r) interval always defines the rightmost palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with delimiters to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Maintain the current rightmost boundary `r` of the largest palindrome found.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update the `(l, r)` boundaries after processing each center.; Incorrectly calculating mirror positions or handling boundary cases for `i > r`.
// - Binary Exponentiation (number, mod-exp, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating a^n efficiently, especially for large n or when results need to be taken modulo some number. It reduces the number of multiplications from linear to logarithmic.
//   • Idea: Binary exponentiation computes a^n by repeatedly squaring the base and multiplying terms corresponding to the set bits in the exponent's binary representation. This method achieves a time complexity of O(log n) multiplications.
//   • Invariants: The product of `result` and `current_base` raised to the `remaining_exponent` equals the initial `a^N`.; `current_base` always represents `a` raised to the power of `2^k` for the current iteration `k`.
//   • Tips: Handle base cases like n=0 (result is 1) and n=1 (result is a).; Use long long or appropriate large integer types for intermediate products to prevent overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Integer overflow if not using appropriate data types or modulo arithmetic.; Incorrectly handling negative exponents (typically not covered by basic binary exponentiation).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

            sb.append(c);

        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            sb.append((char)(c + 1));
        } else {
            sb.append(c);
