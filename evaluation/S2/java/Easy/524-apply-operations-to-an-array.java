//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array nums of size n consisting of non-negative integers.
//
// You need to apply n - 1 operations to this array where, in the ith operation (0-indexed), you will apply the following on the ith element of nums:
//
//
// 	If nums[i] == nums[i + 1], then multiply nums[i] by 2 and set nums[i + 1] to 0. Otherwise, you skip this operation.
//
//
// After performing all the operations, shift all the 0's to the end of the array.
//
//
// 	For example, the array [1,0,2,0,0,1] after shifting all its 0's to the end, is [1,2,1,0,0,0].
//
//
// Return the resulting array.
//
// Note that the operations are applied sequentially, not all at once.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0]
// Output: [1,4,2,0,0,0]
// Explanation: We do the following operations:
// - i = 0: nums[0] and nums[1] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
// - i = 1: nums[1] and nums[2] are equal, we multiply nums[1] by 2 and change nums[2] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,1,1,0].
// - i = 2: nums[2] and nums[3] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
// - i = 3: nums[3] and nums[4] are equal, we multiply nums[3] by 2 and change nums[4] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
// - i = 4: nums[4] and nums[5] are equal, we multiply nums[4] by 2 and change nums[5] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
// After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array [1,4,2,0,0,0].
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 2000
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to perform many range queries on a static array, especially when the query operation is associative and idempotent, allowing for O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
//   • Idea: A Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths. It allows O(1) query time for idempotent operations like min/max/gcd and O(log N) for non-idempotent associative operations, after an O(N log N) build time.
//   • Invariants: After precomputation, dp[k][i] stores the result for the range [i, i + 2^k - 1].; For any k > 0, dp[k][i] is the result of combining dp[k-1][i] and dp[k-1][i + 2^(k-1)].
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values for faster range length calculations.; Store dp[k][i] as the result for range [i, i + 2^k - 1].
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to array elements efficiently.; Requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
