// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-clock-times/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string of length 5 called time, representing the current time on a digital clock in the format "hh:mm". The earliest possible time is "00:00" and the latest possible time is "23:59".
//
// In the string time, the digits represented by the ? symbol are unknown, and must be replaced with a digit from 0 to 9.
//
// Return an integer answer, the number of valid clock times that can be created by replacing every ? with a digit from 0 to 9.
//
// Example:
// Input: time = "?5:00"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: We can replace the ? with either a 0 or 1, producing "05:00" or "15:00". Note that we cannot replace it with a 2, since the time "25:00" is invalid. In total, we have two choices.
//
// Constraints:
// time is a valid string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
// 	"00" <= hh <= "23"
// 	"00" <= mm <= "59"
// 	Some of the digits might be replaced with '?' and need to be replaced with digits from 0 to 9.

// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Finding the equation of a line for a segment (geometry, number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks to count or list all possible combinations, permutations, or arrangements of elements. It's suitable when a brute-force check of all possibilities is feasible.
//   • Idea: Enumeration systematically generates and examines all possible solutions to a problem. This approach guarantees finding the correct answer if one exists, typically with exponential time complexity O(k^N) or O(N!).
//   • Invariants: At each step, the current partial solution is valid according to problem constraints.; All previously explored partial solutions have been processed or discarded.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space and the properties of valid solutions.; Use recursion or iterative loops to explore all branches of the solution space.
//   • Pitfalls: Overlooking edge cases or constraints that limit the search space.; Generating duplicate solutions if not handled carefully.
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring in a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity by leveraging symmetry.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all palindromic substrings in a string by expanding around centers and utilizing symmetry to avoid redundant comparisons. It achieves a linear time complexity of O(N) by maintaining the rightmost boundary of the longest palindrome found so far.
//   • Invariants: For any index k < i, d[k] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at k.; The pair (l, r) always represents the exclusive boundaries of the palindrome that extends furthest to the right among all processed centers.
//   • Tips: Pre-process the string with delimiters (e.g., '#') to uniformly handle both odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage symmetry: for a center 'i' within the current rightmost palindrome, its mirror 'j' provides a lower bound for the palindrome length at 'i'.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when the mirror palindrome extends beyond the current rightmost palindrome.; Forgetting to update the 'l' and 'r' boundaries after finding a new palindrome that extends further to the right.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
