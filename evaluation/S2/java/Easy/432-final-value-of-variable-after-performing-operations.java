// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:
//
//
// 	++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
// 	--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
//
//
// Initially, the value of X is 0.
//
// Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.
//
// Example:
// Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
// Initially, X = 0.
// --X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
// X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
// X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= operations.length <= 100
// 	operations[i] will be either "++X", "X++", "--X", or "X--".

// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: When evaluating or converting arithmetic or logical expressions involving various operators, including unary and binary, and handling different associativities. It's useful for implementing calculators or compilers.
//   • Idea: This technique involves using stacks to parse and evaluate expressions, correctly handling operator precedence and associativity, including unary and right-associative operators. It typically processes expressions in O(N) time, where N is the expression length.
//   • Invariants: The operator stack always maintains operators in increasing order of precedence from bottom to top (excluding parentheses).; When processing an operand, it is immediately pushed onto the operand stack.
//   • Tips: Distinguish unary from binary operators based on context (e.g., preceding token).; Assign higher precedence to unary operators than most binary ones.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying unary vs. binary operators based on context.; Failing to correctly implement operator precedence rules.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
