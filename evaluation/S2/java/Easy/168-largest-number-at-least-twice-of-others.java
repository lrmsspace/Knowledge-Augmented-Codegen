// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums where the largest integer is unique.
//
// Determine whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return the index of the largest element, or return -1 otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: 6 is the largest integer.
// For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x.
// The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 50
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 100
// 	The largest element in nums is unique.

// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, quickselect, randomized)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently find the k-th smallest or largest element in an unsorted array without fully sorting it, especially when average-case linear time complexity is acceptable and in-place modification is desired.
//   • Idea: QuickSelect is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot and recursively searches for the k-th element in the relevant partition. It offers an average-case O(N) time complexity and O(1) space.
//   • Invariants: The pivot element is always placed at its correct sorted position within the current sub-array.; All elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to it, and all elements to its right are greater than or equal to it.
//   • Tips: Randomly select pivots to ensure average-case O(N) performance and avoid worst-case scenarios.; Adjust the target index k based on whether you're seeking the k-th smallest or k-th largest element.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case O(N^2) time complexity, though rare with randomization.; Off-by-one errors are common when mapping k-th largest/smallest to 0-indexed array positions.
// - Second Best Minimum Spanning Tree (graph, array, mst-kruskal, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find a spanning tree with the second smallest total edge weight, often for redundancy or alternative network path planning. It's applicable in scenarios requiring fault tolerance beyond a single optimal solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds a spanning tree with the second minimum total edge weight in a connected, undirected graph. It involves finding the primary MST, then modifying it by replacing one MST edge with a non-MST edge.
//   • Invariants: The primary MST is always a valid spanning tree with minimum total weight.; Adding any non-MST edge (u,v) to the MST creates exactly one cycle.
//   • Tips: First, compute the primary Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using an algorithm like Kruskal's or Prim's.; For each edge not in the MST, adding it to the MST creates a unique cycle. Find the maximum weight edge on this cycle.
//   • Pitfalls: Naively recomputing an entire MST for each removed edge is inefficient (O(V * E log E)).; Incorrectly identifying the maximum weight edge on the cycle formed by adding a non-MST edge.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    public int dominantIndex(int[] nums) {
