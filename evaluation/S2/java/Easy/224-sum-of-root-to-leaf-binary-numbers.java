// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value 0 or 1. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.
//
//
// 	For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13.
//
//
// For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return the sum of these numbers.
//
// The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bits integer.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
// Output: 22
// Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
// 	Node.val is 0 or 1.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent point updates and range sum queries are needed on an array. It offers logarithmic time complexity for both operations, making it more efficient than a simple prefix sum array for dynamic data.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that efficiently calculates prefix sums and updates individual elements in an array. Both operations typically run in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each node `tree[i]` stores the sum of a specific range of elements ending at index `i`.; The length of the range summed by `tree[i]` is determined by `i & (-i)` (lowbit operation).
//   • Tips: Understand the lowbit operation and its role in navigating the tree structure.; Use 1-based indexing for simpler implementation of lowbit calculations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting 1-based indexing can lead to off-by-one errors and incorrect results.; Incorrectly implementing the lowbit calculation or update/query logic.
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
