// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-string-is-a-prefix-of-array/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s and an array of strings words, determine whether s is a prefix string of words.
//
// A string s is a prefix string of words if s can be made by concatenating the first k strings in words for some positive k no larger than words.length.
//
// Return true if s is a prefix string of words, or false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "iloveleetcode", words = ["i","love","leetcode","apples"]
// Output: true
// Explanation:
// s can be made by concatenating "i", "love", and "leetcode" together.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 100
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 20
// 	1 <= s.length <= 1000
// 	words[i] and s consist of only lowercase English letters.

// - Substring Search (string, array, kmp, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern within a larger text, especially when the pattern might have repeating or overlapping prefixes.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that avoids re-scanning characters in the text by pre-processing the pattern to build a 'longest proper prefix suffix' (LPS) array. It achieves optimal O(N + M) time complexity, where N is the text length and M is the pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `j` pointer always indicates the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `text[0...i-1]`.; The `lps[j]` value stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...j-1]`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the LPS array (also known as failure function or border array) for the pattern.; The LPS array helps determine the next best match position after a mismatch, avoiding redundant comparisons.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the LPS array can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors when indexing the pattern or text are common.
// - Tries (trie, array, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing string keys in a symbol table and needing efficient prefix, wildcard, or longest prefix matching operations, offering flexibility beyond binary search trees and speed comparable to hashing.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where keys are typically strings. It allows for efficient retrieval of keys based on their prefixes, achieving O(L) time complexity for operations, where L is the key length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node exists only if it is part of at least one stored key.
//   • Tips: Choose an appropriate branching factor (R) based on the alphabet size.; Represent children using arrays for fixed alphabets or hash maps for sparse ones.
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or sparse data.; Deletion of keys can be complex, requiring careful handling of empty branches.
// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
