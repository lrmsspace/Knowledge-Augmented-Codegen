// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/make-a-square-with-the-same-color/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D matrix grid of size 3 x 3 consisting only of characters 'B' and 'W'. Character 'W' represents the white color, and character 'B' represents the black color.
//
// Your task is to change the color of at most one cell so that the matrix has a 2 x 2 square where all cells are of the same color.
//
// Return true if it is possible to create a 2 x 2 square of the same color, otherwise, return false.
//

// .grid-container {
//   display: grid;
//   grid-template-columns: 30px 30px 30px;
//   padding: 10px;
// }
// .grid-item {
//   background-color: black;
//   border: 1px solid gray;
//   height: 30px;
//   font-size: 30px;
//   text-align: center;
// }
// .grid-item-white {
//   background-color: white;
// }
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [["B","W","B"],["B","W","W"],["B","W","B"]]
//
// Output: true
//
// Explanation:
//
// It can be done by changing the color of the grid[0][2].
//
// Constraints:
// grid.length == 3
// 	grid[i].length == 3
// 	grid[i][j] is either 'W' or 'B'.

// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Check whether a graph is bipartite (graph, queue, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to determine if an undirected graph can be divided into two independent sets such that all edges connect vertices from different sets, or if it is two-colorable.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if an undirected graph is bipartite by attempting to 2-color it using BFS. It assigns alternating colors (or sets) to adjacent vertices, detecting non-bipartite conditions if an edge connects two vertices of the same color.
//   • Invariants: All visited vertices within the current BFS component are correctly 2-colored.; All edges processed so far connect vertices of different colors.
//   • Tips: Use two distinct colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to represent the two sets.; Iterate through all vertices and start a new BFS from any unvisited vertex to handle disconnected components.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected graphs by ensuring all vertices are visited.; Incorrectly assigning colors, leading to false positives or negatives.
// - Check if two segments intersect (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this when determining if two line segments in a 2D plane share any common points, especially when floating-point precision issues need to be avoided.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect by handling collinear and non-collinear cases separately, primarily using integer arithmetic to avoid precision errors. It typically runs in O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: If segments are collinear, their 1D projections on both axes must overlap for intersection.; If segments are not collinear, each segment's endpoints must lie on opposite sides of the line containing the other segment.
//   • Tips: Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.; Utilize cross products for efficient orientation checks.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly identify and handle collinear segments.; Introducing floating-point errors by using division for slopes.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
