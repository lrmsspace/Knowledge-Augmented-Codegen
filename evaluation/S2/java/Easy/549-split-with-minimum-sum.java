//
// Problem Description:
// Given a positive integer num, split it into two non-negative integers num1 and num2 such that:
//
//
// 	The concatenation of num1 and num2 is a permutation of num.
//
// 	
// 		In other words, the sum of the number of occurrences of each digit in num1 and num2 is equal to the number of occurrences of that digit in num.
// 	
// 	
// 	num1 and num2 can contain leading zeros.
//
//
// Return the minimum possible sum of num1 and num2.
//
// Notes:
//
//
// 	It is guaranteed that num does not contain any leading zeros.
// 	The order of occurrence of the digits in num1 and num2 may differ from the order of occurrence of num.
//
// Example:
// Input: num = 4325
// Output: 59
// Explanation: We can split 4325 so that num1 is 24 and num2 is 35, giving a sum of 59. We can prove that 59 is indeed the minimal possible sum.
//
// Constraints:
// 10 <= num <= 109

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
//   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
//   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare strings or substrings, especially in scenarios involving large texts or numerous comparisons. It's also useful for pattern matching and detecting duplicates in collections of strings.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string into a numerical value (hash) to enable fast comparisons and lookups. This technique typically uses polynomial hashing with a base and a modulus, offering O(L) for initial hash computation and O(1) for substring hashes after O(N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: The hash of a string S of length L is (S[0]*P^(L-1) + S[1]*P^(L-2) + ... + S[L-1]*P^0) % M.; For any substring S[i...j], its hash can be derived from precomputed prefix hashes in O(1) time.
//   • Tips: Use multiple hash functions with different bases and moduli to reduce collision probability.; Choose a large prime modulus (e.g., 10^9 + 7) and a random base for robustness.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions are possible; always verify equality for critical applications or use multiple hashes.; Choosing a small or non-prime modulus significantly increases the risk of collisions.

class Solution {
    public int splitNum(int num) {
        // Convert the number to a character array and sort it
        char[] digits = String.valueOf(num).toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(digits);

        // Initialize two numbers as strings
        StringBuilder num1 = new StringBuilder();
        StringBuilder num2 = new StringBuilder();

        // Distribute the digits between num1 and num2
        for (int i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                num1.append(digits[i]);
            } else {
                num2.append(digits[i]);
            }
        }

        // Convert the string builders to integers and return their sum
        return Integer.parseInt(num1.toString()) + Integer.parseInt(num2.toString());           
    }
