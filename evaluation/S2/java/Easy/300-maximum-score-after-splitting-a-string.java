// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-after-splitting-a-string/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s of zeros and ones, return the maximum score after splitting the string into two non-empty substrings (i.e. left substring and right substring).
//
// The score after splitting a string is the number of zeros in the left substring plus the number of ones in the right substring.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "011101"
// Output: 5 
// Explanation: 
// All possible ways of splitting s into two non-empty substrings are:
// left = "0" and right = "11101", score = 1 + 4 = 5 
// left = "01" and right = "1101", score = 1 + 3 = 4 
// left = "011" and right = "101", score = 1 + 2 = 3 
// left = "0111" and right = "01", score = 1 + 1 = 2 
// left = "01110" and right = "1", score = 2 + 1 = 3
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= s.length <= 500
// 	The string s consists of characters '0' and '1' only.

// - Z-function and its calculation (string, array, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a pattern within a text, or to identify repeated prefixes within a string efficiently.
//   • Idea: The Z-function computes an array where each element z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the string and its suffix starting at index i. It runs in linear time, O(N), where N is the length of the string.
//   • Invariants: For all j < i, z[j] correctly stores the length of the longest common prefix between S and S[j...].; The segment [l, r-1] represents the rightmost segment that is a prefix of S and has been fully processed.
//   • Tips: Initialize z[0] to 0 (or N, depending on definition) and handle it as a base case.; Utilize previously computed Z-values to avoid redundant comparisons, especially within the 'rightmost matching segment' [l, r].
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating or using the 'rightmost matching segment' boundaries (l and r).; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices or lengths, especially with 0-based vs. 1-based indexing.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int maxScore(String s) {
        int maxScore = 0;
        int leftZeros = 0;
        int rightOnes = 0;

        // Count total number of ones in the string
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '1') {
                rightOnes++;
            }
        }

        // Iterate through the string and calculate scores for each split
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '0') {
                leftZeros++;
            } else {
                rightOnes--;
            }
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, leftZeros + rightOnes);
        }

        return maxScore;            
    }
