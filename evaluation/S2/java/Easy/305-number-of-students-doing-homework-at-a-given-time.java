// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-students-doing-homework-at-a-given-time/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.
//
// The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].
//
// Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.
//
// Example:
// Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
// Output: 1
// Explanation: We have 3 students where:
// The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and wasn't doing anything at time 4.
// The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 and also wasn't doing anything at time 4.
// The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and was the only student doing homework at time 4.
//
// Constraints:
// startTime.length == endTime.length
// 	1 <= startTime.length <= 100
// 	1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000
// 	1 <= queryTime <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - N/A
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int busyStudent(int[] startTime, int[] endTime, int queryTime) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < startTime.length; i++) {
            if (startTime[i] <= queryTime && endTime[i] >= queryTime) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;           
    }
}
