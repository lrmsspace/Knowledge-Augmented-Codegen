// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-child-who-has-the-ball-after-k-seconds/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two positive integers n and k. There are n children numbered from 0 to n - 1 standing in a queue in order from left to right.
//
// Initially, child 0 holds a ball and the direction of passing the ball is towards the right direction. After each second, the child holding the ball passes it to the child next to them. Once the ball reaches either end of the line, i.e. child 0 or child n - 1, the direction of passing is reversed.
//
// Return the number of the child who receives the ball after k seconds.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, k = 5
//
// Output: 1
//

// - Josephus Problem (number, dp-1d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used to determine the position of the last remaining person in a circle where every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains. It models sequential removal processes in a circular arrangement.
//   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the position of the survivor in a circle of N people, where every K-th person is eliminated. The standard solution uses a recursive relation or dynamic programming, typically achieving O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The result J(n, k) represents the survivor's original 0-indexed position among n people.; Each recursive step J(n, k) correctly transforms the result from J(n-1, k) based on the k-th elimination.
//   • Tips: Use 0-indexing for a simpler and more elegant recursive formula.; Establish the base case for N=1 (the survivor is always 0 or 1).
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when switching between 0-indexing and 1-indexing.; Incorrectly applying the modulo operator, especially with negative results in some languages.

// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
// - Gray code (number, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when a sequence of binary numbers is needed where successive values differ by only one bit. This is useful for error detection in digital systems or position encoders.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit position. Conversion from a binary number `n` to its Gray code `G(n)` is `n ^ (n >> 1)`, and the inverse operation can also be performed efficiently in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: For binary to Gray: The resulting Gray code `G(n)` differs from `n` by exactly one bit for each `n`.; For inverse Gray to binary: The variable `n` accumulates the correct binary value from MSB to LSB.
//   • Tips: Understand the core `n ^ (n >> 1)` transformation for binary to Gray.; The inverse Gray code conversion involves iteratively XORing with right-shifted values.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation.; Incorrectly implementing the iterative inverse transformation logic.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int numberOfChild(int n, int k) {
        int position = 0; // Start at child 0
        int direction = 1; // Start moving to the right

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            position += direction; // Move in the current direction

            // Check if we need to reverse direction at the ends
            if (position == 0 || position == n - 1) {
                direction *= -1; // Reverse direction
            }
