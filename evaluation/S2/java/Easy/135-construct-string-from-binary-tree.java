//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:
//
//
// 	
// 	Node Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.
// 	
// 	
// 	Parentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:
//
// 	
// 		If a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.
// 		If a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.
// 	
// 	
// 	
// 	Omitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.
//
// 	In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
// Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
// Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: When evaluating or converting arithmetic or logical expressions involving various operators, including unary and binary, and handling different associativities. It's useful for implementing calculators or compilers.
//   • Idea: This technique involves using stacks to parse and evaluate expressions, correctly handling operator precedence and associativity, including unary and right-associative operators. It typically processes expressions in O(N) time, where N is the expression length.
//   • Invariants: The operator stack always maintains operators in increasing order of precedence from bottom to top (excluding parentheses).; When processing an operand, it is immediately pushed onto the operand stack.
//   • Tips: Distinguish unary from binary operators based on context (e.g., preceding token).; Assign higher precedence to unary operators than most binary ones.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying unary vs. binary operators based on context.; Failing to correctly implement operator precedence rules.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
