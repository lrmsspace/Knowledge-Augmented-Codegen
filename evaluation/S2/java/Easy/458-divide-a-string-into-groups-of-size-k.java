// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-a-string-into-groups-of-size-k/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure:
//
//
// 	The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each element can be a part of exactly one group.
// 	For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.
//
//
// Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.
//
// Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"
// Output: ["abc","def","ghi"]
// Explanation:
// The first 3 characters "abc" form the first group.
// The next 3 characters "def" form the second group.
// The last 3 characters "ghi" form the third group.
// Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.
// Thus, the groups formed are "abc", "def", and "ghi".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 100
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters only.
// 	1 <= k <= 100
// 	fill is a lowercase English letter.

// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
// - Substring Search (string, array, kmp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern string within a larger text string efficiently. It is particularly useful when the pattern might have significant self-overlapping prefixes and suffixes, allowing for linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently searches for occurrences of a pattern within a text by avoiding redundant comparisons. It preprocesses the pattern to build a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) or Longest Proper Prefix Suffix (LPS) array, achieving O(N + M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: During DFA construction, dfa[c][j] correctly stores the next state if character c is encountered in state j.; During DFA construction, x maintains the length of the longest proper prefix of pattern[0...j-1] that is also a suffix of pattern[0...j-1].
//   • Tips: Precompute the LPS array or DFA for the pattern to guide the search.; The LPS array indicates the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix, enabling efficient shifts.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect construction of the LPS array or DFA is a common source of errors.; High constant factors for small alphabets or short patterns might make simpler algorithms faster.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public String[] divideString(String s, int k, char fill) {
        int n = s.length();
        int numGroups = (n + k - 1) / k; // Calculate the number of groups needed
        String[] result = new String[numGroups];

        for (int i = 0; i < numGroups; i++) {
            int startIndex = i * k;
            int endIndex = Math.min(startIndex + k, n);
            String group = s.substring(startIndex, endIndex);

            // If the last group is shorter than k, fill it with the fill character
            if (group.length() < k) {
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(group);
                while (sb.length() < k) {
                    sb.append(fill);
                }
                group = sb.toString();
            }

            result[i] = group;
        }
