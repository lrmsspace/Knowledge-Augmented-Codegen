// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-english-letter-in-upper-and-lower-case/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string of English letters s, return the greatest English letter which occurs as both a lowercase and uppercase letter in s. The returned letter should be in uppercase. If no such letter exists, return an empty string.
//
// An English letter b is greater than another letter a if b appears after a in the English alphabet.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "lEeTcOdE"
// Output: "E"
// Explanation:
// The letter 'E' is the only letter to appear in both lower and upper case.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 1000
// 	s consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Finding repetitions (string, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to find all occurrences of repeating substrings within a given string. It is suitable for problems requiring the identification of periodic patterns or structural redundancies.
//   • Idea: This algorithm, often exemplified by Main-Lorentz, uses a divide-and-conquer strategy with Z-function as a subroutine to efficiently find all repetitions in a string. It typically achieves an O(N log N) time complexity for finding and describing repetitions.
//   • Invariants: All repetitions fully contained within the left or right subproblems are found recursively.; Crossing repetitions are identified by combining information from both subproblems using Z-function.
//   • Tips: Understand the definition of a 'repetition' (e.g., Crochemore triples or (i, p, r) tuples).; Leverage string algorithms like Z-function for efficient substring matching in subproblems.
//   • Pitfalls: Expanding compact repetition tuples to full start/end indices can lead to O(N^2) complexity.; Incorrectly handling string reversal or concatenation for Z-function applications.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
