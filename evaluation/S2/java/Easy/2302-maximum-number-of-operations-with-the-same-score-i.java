// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-operations-with-the-same-score-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of integers nums. Consider the following operation:
//
//
// 	Delete the first two elements nums and define the score of the operation as the sum of these two elements.
//
//
// You can perform this operation until nums contains fewer than two elements. Additionally, the same score must be achieved in all operations.
//
// Return the maximum number of operations you can perform.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,2,1,4,5]
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	We can perform the first operation with the score 3 + 2 = 5. After this operation, nums = [1,4,5].
// 	We can perform the second operation as its score is 4 + 1 = 5, the same as the previous operation. After this operation, nums = [5].
// 	As there are fewer than two elements, we can't perform more operations.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
//

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
// - Minkowski sum of convex polygons (geometry, array, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to compute the sum of two convex polygons, or efficiently determine the minimum distance or intersection between them.
//   • Idea: The Minkowski sum of two convex polygons P and Q is a new convex polygon formed by vector addition of all points from P and Q. It can be computed in O(|P| + |Q|) time by merging their edge vectors.
//   • Invariants: The current edge added to the Minkowski sum is the one with the smallest angle among the remaining edges from both polygons.; The sequence of edges in the Minkowski sum maintains convexity.
//   • Tips: The vertices of P+Q are sums of vertices of P and Q.; The edges of P+Q are the edges of P and Q, sorted by angle.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like collinear edges or degenerate polygons.; Floating point precision issues in geometric calculations.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                int score = nums[i] + nums[j];
                int operations = countOperations(nums, score);
                maxOperations = Math.max(maxOperations, operations);
