// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/take-gifts-from-the-richest-pile/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array gifts denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:
//
//
// 	Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
// 	If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
// 	Reduce the number of gifts in the pile to the floor of the square root of the original number of gifts in the pile.
//
//
// Return the number of gifts remaining after k seconds.
//
// Example:
// Input: gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4
// Output: 29
// Explanation: 
// The gifts are taken in the following way:
// - In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.
// - Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.
// - After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.
// - Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.
// The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= gifts.length <= 103
// 	1 <= gifts[i] <= 109
// 	1 <= k <= 103
//

// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
// - Sqrt Tree (array, number, bitmask-dp, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Used for answering range queries on a static array by recursively decomposing it into square root sized blocks, achieving O(log log N) query time.
//   • Idea: A Sqrt Tree is a recursive data structure that decomposes an array into blocks of square root size, building a similar structure on each block. It allows for efficient range queries, typically achieving O(log log N) query time after an O(N log log N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the Sqrt Tree represents a contiguous segment of the original array.; A node representing a segment of length k has sqrt(k) children, each covering a block of sqrt(k) elements.
//   • Tips: Precompute answers for all possible block combinations within a node.; Handle queries spanning multiple blocks by combining precomputed prefix, suffix, and full block results.
//   • Pitfalls: High constant factors due to complex precomputation per node.; Memory usage can be significant, O(N log log N), for large N.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
