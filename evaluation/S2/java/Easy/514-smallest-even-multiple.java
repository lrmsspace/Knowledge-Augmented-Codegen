// Problem Description:
// Given a positive integer n, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5
// Output: 10
// Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 5 and 2 is 10.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 150

// - Integer factorization (number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to decompose a composite integer into its prime factors, especially for numbers where trial division is feasible. It's suitable for problems requiring the unique prime components of a number.
//   • Idea: Integer factorization decomposes a given composite number into a product of its prime factors. The most common approach, trial division, involves testing divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of the number, with optimizations for small primes and patterns like modulo 6.
//   • Invariants: The product of found prime factors multiplied by the current number equals the original number.; All prime factors found so far are less than or equal to the current trial divisor.
//   • Tips: Handle small prime factors (2, 3, 5) separately for efficiency.; Optimize trial division by checking only primes or numbers of form 6k +/- 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where the remaining number is a prime factor itself.; Inefficiently checking all numbers instead of only potential prime divisors.
// - Gray code (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
//   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
//   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.
// - Binary Exponentiation (number, mod-exp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently compute large integer powers of a number, especially when results need to be taken modulo a specific value. It is crucial for problems requiring powers with large exponents.
//   • Idea: Binary exponentiation, also known as exponentiation by squaring, computes a^n by breaking down the exponent n into its binary representation. This method significantly reduces the number of multiplications required, achieving an O(log n) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: In the iterative approach, (current_result * (original_base ^ original_exponent)) remains constant.; The exponent n is always non-negative and decreases towards zero.
//   • Tips: Apply the modulo operation at each multiplication step to prevent intermediate overflow.; The iterative approach is generally preferred over recursion to avoid potential stack overflow for very large exponents.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to apply modulo at each step can lead to integer overflow, especially with large bases.; Incorrectly handling the base case for n=0 or n=1.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        // The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n is the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and n.
        // The LCM of two numbers a and b can be calculated using the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).
        // In this case, we need to calculate GCD(2, n) to find the LCM.

        int gcd = gcd(2, n);
        return (2 * n) / gcd;           
    }
