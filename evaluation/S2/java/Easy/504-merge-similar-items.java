// Problem Description:
// You are given two 2D integer arrays, items1 and items2, representing two sets of items. Each array items has the following properties:
//
//
// 	items[i] = [valuei, weighti] where valuei represents the value and weighti represents the weight of the ith item.
// 	The value of each item in items is unique.
//
//
// Return a 2D integer array ret where ret[i] = [valuei, weighti], with weighti being the sum of weights of all items with value valuei.
//
// Note: ret should be returned in ascending order by value.
//
// Example:
// Input: items1 = [[1,1],[4,5],[3,8]], items2 = [[3,1],[1,5]]
// Output: [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]]
// Explanation: 
// The item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 5, total weight = 1 + 5 = 6.
// The item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 8 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 8 + 1 = 9.
// The item with value = 4 occurs in items1 with weight = 5, total weight = 5.  
// Therefore, we return [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= items1.length, items2.length <= 1000
// 	items1[i].length == items2[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= valuei, weighti <= 1000
// 	Each valuei in items1 is unique.
// 	Each valuei in items2 is unique.

// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items, each with a weight and value, to maximize total value within a limited capacity, where each item can be chosen multiple times. It is suitable for problems exhibiting optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack Problem involves selecting items to maximize total value within a fixed capacity. The complete knapsack variant, where items can be taken multiple times, is typically solved using dynamic programming in O(nW) time and O(W) space.
//   • Invariants: For 2D DP `f[i][j]`, it represents the maximum value obtainable using only the first `i` items with a total weight not exceeding `j`.; For 1D DP `dp[j]`, after processing item `i`, it stores the maximum value obtainable with a total weight not exceeding `j`, considering all items up to `i`.
//   • Tips: For the complete knapsack, iterate capacity `j` forwards (from `w_i` to `W`) when using 1D DP to allow multiple selections of the current item.; The 1D DP array `dp[j]` stores the maximum value achievable for exactly capacity `j`.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-1 knapsack with complete knapsack, especially in the 1D DP iteration direction for capacity.; Incorrectly initializing the DP array, leading to incorrect base cases or propagation.
// - Minkowski sum of convex polygons (geometry, array, two-pointers, sweep-line)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to compute the Minkowski sum of two convex polygons efficiently. It is ideal for applications requiring the union of shapes or collision detection between convex objects.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes the Minkowski sum of two convex polygons by merging their edge vectors, sorted by polar angle, into a new sequence of edges. The resulting sum polygon is also convex and can be constructed in O(|P| + |Q|) time.
//   • Invariants: The current vertex of the resulting sum polygon is the sum of the current vertices from P and Q.; All edges processed so far from both input polygons have been added to the output in polar angle order.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort polygon vertices to start from the lowest Y-coordinate to ensure consistent orientation.; Orient both input polygons counter-clockwise for correct edge vector generation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling polygon orientation (e.g., mixing clockwise and counter-clockwise).; Precision issues when using floating-point numbers for angle comparisons or vector additions.
// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, linked-list, union-find, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and perform union operations to merge sets or find the representative of an element's set efficiently. It's suitable for problems involving dynamic connectivity or grouping elements.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: finding the representative of an element's set and merging two sets. It achieves nearly constant time complexity for these operations with path compression and union by rank/size optimizations.
//   • Invariants: Every element `i` belongs to exactly one set, represented by `find(i)`.; If `parent[i] == i`, then `i` is the representative (root) of its set.
//   • Tips: Implement path compression in `find` for optimal performance.; Use union by size or rank to maintain balanced trees.
//   • Pitfalls: Omitting path compression or union by rank/size can degrade performance to O(N).; Failing to correctly update auxiliary data stored at representatives during a union operation.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
