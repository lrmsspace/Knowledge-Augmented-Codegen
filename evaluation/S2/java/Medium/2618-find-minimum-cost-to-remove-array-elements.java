//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums. Your task is to remove all elements from the array by performing one of the following operations at each step until nums is empty:
//
//
// 	Choose any two elements from the first three elements of nums and remove them. The cost of this operation is the maximum of the two elements removed.
// 	If fewer than three elements remain in nums, remove all the remaining elements in a single operation. The cost of this operation is the maximum of the remaining elements.
//
//
// Return the minimum cost required to remove all the elements.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [6,2,8,4]
//
// Output: 12
//
// Explanation:
//
// Initially, nums = [6, 2, 8, 4].
//
//
// 	In the first operation, remove nums[0] = 6 and nums[2] = 8 with a cost of max(6, 8) = 8. Now, nums = [2, 4].
// 	In the second operation, remove the remaining elements with a cost of max(2, 4) = 4.
//
//
// The cost to remove all elements is 8 + 4 = 12. This is the minimum cost to remove all elements in nums. Hence, the output is 12.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 106
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
//   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
// - Second Best Minimum Spanning Tree (graph, array, mst-kruskal, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find a spanning tree with the second smallest total edge weight, often for redundancy or alternative network path planning. It's applicable in scenarios requiring fault tolerance beyond a single optimal solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds a spanning tree with the second minimum total edge weight in a connected, undirected graph. It involves finding the primary MST, then modifying it by replacing one MST edge with a non-MST edge.
//   • Invariants: The primary MST is always a valid spanning tree with minimum total weight.; Adding any non-MST edge (u,v) to the MST creates exactly one cycle.
//   • Tips: First, compute the primary Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using an algorithm like Kruskal's or Prim's.; For each edge not in the MST, adding it to the MST creates a unique cycle. Find the maximum weight edge on this cycle.
//   • Pitfalls: Naively recomputing an entire MST for each removed edge is inefficient (O(V * E log E)).; Incorrectly identifying the maximum weight edge on the cycle formed by adding a non-MST edge.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

                if (len <= 2) {
                    dp[l][r] = max(nums, l, r);

                    dp[l][r] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
