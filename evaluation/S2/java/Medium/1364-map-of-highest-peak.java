//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer matrix isWater of size m x n that represents a map of land and water cells.
//
//
// 	If isWater[i][j] == 0, cell (i, j) is a land cell.
// 	If isWater[i][j] == 1, cell (i, j) is a water cell.
//
//
// You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:
//
//
// 	The height of each cell must be non-negative.
// 	If the cell is a water cell, its height must be 0.
// 	Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of at most 1. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).
//
//
// Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is maximized.
//
// Return an integer matrix height of size m x n where height[i][j] is cell (i, j)'s height. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
//
// Example:
// Input: isWater = [[0,1],[0,0]]
// Output: [[1,0],[2,1]]
// Explanation: The image shows the assigned heights of each cell.
// The blue cell is the water cell, and the green cells are the land cells.
//
// Constraints:
// m == isWater.length
// 	n == isWater[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 1000
// 	isWater[i][j] is 0 or 1.
// 	There is at least one water cell.
//

// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, array, dijkstra, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum costs without a full priority queue.
//   • Idea: A specialized Breadth-First Search variant that finds shortest paths in graphs with only 0 or 1 edge weights. It uses a deque to process 0-weight edges before 1-weight edges, achieving O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the deque have a distance value of either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.; Nodes pushed to the front of the deque always have a distance equal to the current node's distance.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque to maintain the order of processing nodes.; Add nodes reached via 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a standard queue instead of a deque.; Failing to initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the source.
// - Maximum flow - Push-relabel algorithm (graph, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum flow in a network, particularly for dense graphs or when the Ford-Fulkerson method is too slow due to many augmenting paths.
//   • Idea: The Push-relabel algorithm computes maximum flow by maintaining a preflow and a height function, iteratively pushing excess flow from higher to lower nodes and relabeling nodes until all excess is pushed to the sink. It is a highly efficient polynomial-time algorithm for various graph structures.
//   • Invariants: For any vertex v (not source or sink), the total incoming flow minus total outgoing flow is non-negative (excess flow).; For any edge (u, v) in the residual graph with positive capacity, the height of u is at most h(v) + 1.
//   • Tips: Understand the concepts of preflow and excess flow.; Correctly implement push and relabel operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating residual capacities after a push.; Failing to maintain the height function property (h(u) <= h(v) + 1).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
