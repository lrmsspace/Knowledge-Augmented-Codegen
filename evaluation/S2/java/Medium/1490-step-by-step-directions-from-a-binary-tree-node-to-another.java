// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/step-by-step-directions-from-a-binary-tree-node-to-another/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is uniquely assigned a value from 1 to n. You are also given an integer startValue representing the value of the start node s, and a different integer destValue representing the value of the destination node t.
//
// Find the shortest path starting from node s and ending at node t. Generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the uppercase letters 'L', 'R', and 'U'. Each letter indicates a specific direction:
//
//
// 	'L' means to go from a node to its left child node.
// 	'R' means to go from a node to its right child node.
// 	'U' means to go from a node to its parent node.
//
//
// Return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node s to node t.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6
// Output: "UURL"
// Explanation: The shortest path is: 3 → 1 → 5 → 2 → 6.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is n.
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= Node.val <= n
// 	All the values in the tree are unique.
// 	1 <= startValue, destValue <= n
// 	startValue != destValue

// - The Stern-Brocot tree and Farey sequences (number, tree, binary-search, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this when representing positive rational numbers as unique paths in a binary tree or when efficiently approximating irrational numbers. It's ideal for finding a fraction's path or its position within ordered sequences.
//   • Idea: The Stern-Brocot tree uniquely maps every positive rational number to a binary path, constructed by repeatedly taking mediants. This allows for efficient search and representation of fractions with O(log(p+q)) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The target fraction p/q always lies strictly between the current left boundary pL/qL and right boundary pR/qR.; The current left and right boundary fractions (pL/qL, pR/qR) are always adjacent terms in some Farey sequence.
//   • Tips: Initialize search boundaries with 0/1 and 1/0 (or 1/1 for positive fractions).; Calculate the mediant (pL+pR)/(qL+qR) to determine the next candidate fraction.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive O(p+q) search without run-length encoding can be too slow for large fractions.; Incorrectly handling initial boundary conditions (e.g., 0/1, 1/0, 1/1).
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Tarjan's off-line algorithm (tree, ds, dfs, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Lowest Common Ancestor for multiple pairs of nodes in a tree, and all queries are known beforehand. It's an efficient offline approach for batch processing LCA queries.
//   • Idea: Tarjan's offline LCA algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal combined with a Union-Find data structure to answer all LCA queries efficiently. It processes N nodes and Q queries in O(N + Q * alpha(N)) time, where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.
//   • Invariants: After visiting a node 'u' and all its children, 'u' is marked as visited.; For any node 'v' whose subtree has been fully processed, 'find_set(v)' returns the representative of 'v''s component.
//   • Tips: Mark nodes as visited during DFS to track processed subtrees.; Use Union-Find's union operation to merge child subtrees with their parent after processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited, leading to incorrect LCA identification.; Incorrectly updating the 'ancestor' array or 'find_set' logic in Union-Find.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
