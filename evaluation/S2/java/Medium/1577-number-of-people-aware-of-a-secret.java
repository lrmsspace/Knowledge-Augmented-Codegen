// Problem Description:
// On day 1, one person discovers a secret.
//
// You are given an integer delay, which means that each person will share the secret with a new person every day, starting from delay days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer forget, which means that each person will forget the secret forget days after discovering it. A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.
//
// Given an integer n, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 6, delay = 2, forget = 4
// Output: 5
// Explanation:
// Day 1: Suppose the first person is named A. (1 person)
// Day 2: A is the only person who knows the secret. (1 person)
// Day 3: A shares the secret with a new person, B. (2 people)
// Day 4: A shares the secret with a new person, C. (3 people)
// Day 5: A forgets the secret, and B shares the secret with a new person, D. (3 people)
// Day 6: B shares the secret with E, and C shares the secret with F. (5 people)
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 1000
// 	1 <= delay < forget <= n

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Factorial modulo 
// p (number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total count of possibilities or arrangements that can be naturally broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems. It's effective for exploring decision trees or state spaces.
//   • Idea: Counting determines the number of elements or event occurrences. It uses combinatorial or iterative/recursive methods, often with O(N) or O(log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each recursive call processes a smaller, well-defined subproblem.; The base cases correctly return the count for the simplest scenarios.
//   • Tips: Identify the smallest subproblem and its base cases to stop recursion.; Define the recursive relation clearly, showing how larger problems depend on smaller ones.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect results.; Overlapping subproblems without memoization can lead to exponential time complexity.
// - Discrete Logarithm (array, number, binary-search, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when solving for the exponent 'x' in the modular equation a^x = b (mod m), especially when 'm' is large and a and m are coprime. It's suitable for finding a solution within O(sqrt(m) log m) time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm, also known as Baby-step Giant-step, finds the smallest non-negative integer 'x' satisfying a^x = b (mod m) using a meet-in-the-middle approach. It achieves a time complexity of O(sqrt(m) log m).
//   • Invariants: The map stores (a^q mod m, q) for all baby steps q in [0, n-1].; For each giant step p, a^(np) mod m is correctly computed.
//   • Tips: Choose 'n' as ceil(sqrt(m)) for balanced steps.; Use a hash map to store baby steps for O(1) average lookup.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect choice of 'n' can lead to suboptimal time complexity.; Failure to check if 'a' and 'm' are coprime may yield no solution or incorrect results.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
