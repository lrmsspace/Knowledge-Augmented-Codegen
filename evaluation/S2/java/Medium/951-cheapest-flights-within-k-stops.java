// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.
//
// You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
// Output: 700
// Explanation:
// The graph is shown above.
// The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
// Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 100
// 	0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
// 	flights[i].length == 3
// 	0 <= fromi, toi < n
// 	fromi != toi
// 	1 <= pricei <= 104
// 	There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
// 	0 <= src, dst, k < n
// 	src != dst

// - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (graph, matrix, floyd-warshall, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, especially if it contains negative edge weights but no negative cycles. It is well-suited for dense graphs.
//   • Idea: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm computes all-pairs shortest paths in a weighted graph by iteratively considering all vertices as intermediate nodes. It is a dynamic programming approach with a time complexity of O(V^3).
//   • Invariants: After the k-th outer loop iteration, dist[i][j] holds the shortest path from i to j using only vertices 0 to k-1 as intermediate nodes.; For any i, dist[i][i] is non-positive; if dist[i][i] < 0, a negative cycle exists through i.
//   • Tips: Initialize dist[i][j] with edge weights, 0 for i=j, and infinity otherwise.; After running, check dist[t][t] < 0 for any t to detect negative cycles.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating-point errors accumulate exponentially, making it unsuitable for high-precision float weights.; Standard algorithm does not correctly handle paths involving negative cycles; special detection is required.
// - Minimum-cost flow - Successive shortest path algorithm (graph, array, number, greedy, dijkstra, bellman-ford)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a flow of a certain amount (or maximum possible flow) through a network while minimizing the total cost associated with sending flow along edges. It is suitable for problems involving resource allocation with varying costs.
//   • Idea: The successive shortest path algorithm finds a minimum-cost flow by repeatedly finding a shortest augmenting path in the residual graph and pushing flow along it. Its complexity depends on the shortest path algorithm used (Bellman-Ford for general costs, Dijkstra with potentials for non-negative residual costs).
//   • Invariants: At the start of each iteration, the current flow is a valid flow from source to sink.; The residual graph correctly represents remaining capacities and reverse edges for the current flow.
//   • Tips: Use potentials (reduced costs) with Dijkstra to efficiently handle non-negative edge costs in the residual graph.; Initialize potentials to zero and update them after each shortest path computation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating residual capacities or reverse edge costs can lead to wrong results.; Failing to use potentials with Dijkstra can lead to incorrect shortest paths in graphs with negative edges.
// - Dijkstra on sparse graphs (heap, queue, dijkstra)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights, especially efficient for sparse graphs.
//   • Idea: Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It uses a priority queue to greedily explore vertices, achieving O(E log V) complexity with a binary heap.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each iteration, dist[u] holds the shortest distance found so far from the source to u.; All vertices already extracted from the priority queue have their final shortest distance determined.
//   • Tips: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently retrieve the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance.; Initialize all distances to infinity and the source distance to zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not work correctly with negative edge weights; Bellman-Ford or SPFA is needed.; Forgetting to mark vertices as visited or handle duplicate entries in the priority queue can lead to incorrectness or TLE.
