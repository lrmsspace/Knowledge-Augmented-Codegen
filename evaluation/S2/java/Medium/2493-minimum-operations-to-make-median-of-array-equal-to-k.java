// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-median-of-array-equal-to-k/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums and a non-negative integer k. In one operation, you can increase or decrease any element by 1.
//
// Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the median of nums equal to k.
//
// The median of an array is defined as the middle element of the array when it is sorted in non-decreasing order. If there are two choices for a median, the larger of the two values is taken.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,5,6,8,5], k = 4
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
// We can subtract one from nums[1] and nums[4] to obtain [2, 4, 6, 8, 4]. The median of the resulting array is equal to k.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
// 	1 <= k <= 109

// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
// - Manhattan Distance (geometry, number, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating distance between two points on a grid where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical directions. It is also useful for problems involving maximizing or minimizing sums of absolute coordinate differences, often transformable to Chebyshev distance.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance measures the sum of absolute differences of Cartesian coordinates between two points. It can be transformed into a Chebyshev distance problem by rotating coordinates, enabling efficient O(N) max/min distance calculations.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1=(x1, y1) and P2=(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is always non-negative.; The transformed points P1'=(x1+y1, y1-x1) and P2'=(x2+y2, y2-x2) satisfy Chebyshev(P1', P2') == Manhattan(P1, P2).
//   • Tips: Consider transforming to Chebyshev distance for max/min distance problems.; The transformation involves rotating coordinates: (x, y) -> (x+y, y-x).
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing with Euclidean distance, which allows diagonal movement.; Incorrectly applying coordinate transformation (e.g., wrong signs).
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public long minOperationsToMakeMedianK(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int medianIndex = (n - 1) / 2; // Index of the median element in a sorted array
        long operations = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < k) {
                operations += k - num; // Increase num to k
            } else if (num > k) {
                operations += num - k; // Decrease num to k
            }
        }

        return operations;
