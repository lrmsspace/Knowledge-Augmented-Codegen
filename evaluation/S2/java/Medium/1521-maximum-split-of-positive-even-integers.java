//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer finalSum. Split it into a sum of a maximum number of unique positive even integers.
//
//
// 	For example, given finalSum = 12, the following splits are valid (unique positive even integers summing up to finalSum): (12), (2 + 10), (2 + 4 + 6), and (4 + 8). Among them, (2 + 4 + 6) contains the maximum number of integers. Note that finalSum cannot be split into (2 + 2 + 4 + 4) as all the numbers should be unique.
//
//
// Return a list of integers that represent a valid split containing a maximum number of integers. If no valid split exists for finalSum, return an empty list. You may return the integers in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: finalSum = 12
// Output: [2,4,6]
// Explanation: The following are valid splits: (12), (2 + 10), (2 + 4 + 6), and (4 + 8).
// (2 + 4 + 6) has the maximum number of integers, which is 3. Thus, we return [2,4,6].
// Note that [2,6,4], [6,2,4], etc. are also accepted.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= finalSum <= 1010
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Integer factorization (number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to decompose a composite integer into its prime factors, especially for numbers where trial division is feasible. It's suitable for problems requiring the unique prime components of a number.
//   • Idea: Integer factorization decomposes a given composite number into a product of its prime factors. The most common approach, trial division, involves testing divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of the number, with optimizations for small primes and patterns like modulo 6.
//   • Invariants: The product of found prime factors multiplied by the current number equals the original number.; All prime factors found so far are less than or equal to the current trial divisor.
//   • Tips: Handle small prime factors (2, 3, 5) separately for efficiency.; Optimize trial division by checking only primes or numbers of form 6k +/- 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where the remaining number is a prime factor itself.; Inefficiently checking all numbers instead of only potential prime divisors.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public List<Long> maximumEvenSplit(long finalSum) {
        List<Long> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (finalSum % 2 != 0) {
            return result; // If finalSum is odd, return an empty list
        }

        long currentEven = 2;
        while (finalSum >= currentEven) {
            result.add(currentEven);
            finalSum -= currentEven;
            currentEven += 2; // Move to the next even number
        }

        // If there is any remaining sum, add it to the last element
        if (finalSum > 0) {
            long lastElement = result.get(result.size() - 1);
            result.set(result.size() - 1, lastElement + finalSum);
        }

        return result;
