//
// Problem Description:
// An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
//
// Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 10
// Output: 12
// Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 1690
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Integer factorization (number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to decompose a composite integer into its prime factors, especially for numbers where trial division is feasible. It's suitable for problems requiring the unique prime components of a number.
//   • Idea: Integer factorization decomposes a given composite number into a product of its prime factors. The most common approach, trial division, involves testing divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of the number, with optimizations for small primes and patterns like modulo 6.
//   • Invariants: The product of found prime factors multiplied by the current number equals the original number.; All prime factors found so far are less than or equal to the current trial divisor.
//   • Tips: Handle small prime factors (2, 3, 5) separately for efficiency.; Optimize trial division by checking only primes or numbers of form 6k +/- 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where the remaining number is a prime factor itself.; Inefficiently checking all numbers instead of only potential prime divisors.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        int[] uglyNumbers = new int[n];
        uglyNumbers[0] = 1;

        int index2 = 0, index3 = 0, index5 = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int nextUgly = Math.min(uglyNumbers[index2] * 2,
                    Math.min(uglyNumbers[index3] * 3, uglyNumbers[index5] * 5));
            uglyNumbers[i] = nextUgly;

            if (nextUgly == uglyNumbers[index2] * 2) {
                index2++;
            }
            if (nextUgly == uglyNumbers[index3] * 3) {
                index3++;
            }
            if (nextUgly == uglyNumbers[index5] * 5) {
                index5++;
            }
        }

        return uglyNumbers[n - 1];          
    }
