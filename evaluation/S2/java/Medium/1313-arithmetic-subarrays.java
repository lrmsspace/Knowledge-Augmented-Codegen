// Problem Description:
// A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence s is arithmetic if and only if s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] for all valid i.
//
// For example, these are arithmetic sequences:
//
//
// 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
// 7, 7, 7, 7
// 3, -1, -5, -9
//
// The following sequence is not arithmetic:
//
//
// 1, 1, 2, 5, 7
//
// You are given an array of n integers, nums, and two arrays of m integers each, l and r, representing the m range queries, where the ith query is the range [l[i], r[i]]. All the arrays are 0-indexed.
//
// Return a list of boolean elements answer, where answer[i] is true if the subarray nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]] can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [4,6,5,9,3,7], l = [0,0,2], r = [2,3,5]
// Output: [true,false,true]
// Explanation:
// In the 0th query, the subarray is [4,6,5]. This can be rearranged as [6,5,4], which is an arithmetic sequence.
// In the 1st query, the subarray is [4,6,5,9]. This cannot be rearranged as an arithmetic sequence.
// In the 2nd query, the subarray is [5,9,3,7]. This can be rearranged as [3,5,7,9], which is an arithmetic sequence.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	m == l.length
// 	m == r.length
// 	2 <= n <= 500
// 	1 <= m <= 500
// 	0 <= l[i] < r[i] < n
// 	-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Range Minimum Query (array, sparse-table)
//   • When to use: When performing many range minimum queries on a static array, especially when query time needs to be logarithmic after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes minimums for all possible ranges of power-of-two lengths, allowing O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing. It efficiently answers range minimum queries on an immutable array.
//   • Invariants: For any `j`, `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum value in the segment starting at `i` with length `2^j`.; The `log_table[k]` stores `floor(log2(k))` for efficient length calculation.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values or use `std::log2` for efficient length calculations.; The `dp[i][j]` entry stores the minimum in the range `[i, i + 2^j - 1]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to the array elements; it's for static data only.; Higher memory consumption compared to some other range query structures.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
