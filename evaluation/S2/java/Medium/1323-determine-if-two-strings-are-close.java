// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:
//
//
// 	Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
//
// 	
// 		For example, abcde -> aecdb
// 	
// 	
// 	Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
// 	
// 		For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
// 	
// 	
//
//
// You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.
//
// Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
// Output: true
// Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
// Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
// Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 105
// 	word1 and word2 contain only lowercase English letters.

// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Check if two segments intersect (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this when determining if two line segments in a 2D plane share any common points, especially when floating-point precision issues need to be avoided.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect by handling collinear and non-collinear cases separately, primarily using integer arithmetic to avoid precision errors. It typically runs in O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: If segments are collinear, their 1D projections on both axes must overlap for intersection.; If segments are not collinear, each segment's endpoints must lie on opposite sides of the line containing the other segment.
//   • Tips: Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.; Utilize cross products for efficient orientation checks.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly identify and handle collinear segments.; Introducing floating-point errors by using division for slopes.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
