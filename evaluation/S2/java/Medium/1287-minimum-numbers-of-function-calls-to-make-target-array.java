//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums. You have an integer array arr of the same length with all values set to 0 initially. You also have the following modify function:
//
// You want to use the modify function to convert arr to nums using the minimum number of calls.
//
// Return the minimum number of function calls to make nums from arr.
//
// The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit signed integer.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,5]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Increment by 1 (second element): [0, 0] to get [0, 1] (1 operation).
// Double all the elements: [0, 1] -> [0, 2] -> [0, 4] (2 operations).
// Increment by 1 (both elements)  [0, 4] -> [1, 4] -> [1, 5] (2 operations).
// Total of operations: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 109

// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It provides logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that can efficiently update individual elements and calculate prefix sums in an array. Both operations are performed in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each `tree[i]` element stores the sum of a contiguous range of elements from the original array, specifically from `i - (i & -i) + 1` to `i` (inclusive, 1-based).; After any `update(idx, val)` operation, `query(idx)` will reflect the new sum up to `idx`.
//   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for array elements to simplify bitwise logic; The `idx & -idx` operation is key to navigating the implicit tree structure
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-based and 1-based indexing can lead to incorrect results; Off-by-one errors when calculating range sums (e.g., `query(R) - query(L-1)`)
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Binary Exponentiation by Factoring (number, counting, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when performing modular exponentiation for an odd base modulo a power of two, especially when dealing with specific logarithmic-like functions or inverses in this modulus.
//   • Idea: This technique computes modular exponentiation for an odd base modulo a power of two by factoring the exponent or its inverse into a product of terms like (2^n+1). It leverages bit manipulation to efficiently find this factorization, allowing for O(d) or O(d log d) complexity where d is the exponent of the modulus.
//   • Invariants: During the iterative process to find $x^{-1} \pmod{2^d}$, the current value of $x$ is always odd.; After processing bit $n$, the $n$-th bit of the current $x$ (for $x^{-1}$ calculation) is zero, and lower bits are unchanged.
//   • Tips: Precompute $4L(2^n+1)$ values for efficiency.; Leverage bitwise operations for multiplying by $2^n+1$ (e.g., x = x + (x << n)).
//   • Pitfalls: This method is specific to odd bases and moduli of the form $2^d$; it's not a general modular exponentiation.; Careful handling of negative results from $4L(x^{-1})$ when working with modular arithmetic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int operations = 0;
        int maxNum = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            operations += Integer.bitCount(num);
            maxNum = Math.max(maxNum, num);
        }

        while (maxNum > 0) {
            operations++;
            maxNum /= 2;
        }

        return operations - 1; // Subtract 1 to account for the last doubling operation that is not needed          
    }
