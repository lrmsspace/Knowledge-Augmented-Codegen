// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-white-tiles-covered-by-a-carpet/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array tiles where tiles[i] = [li, ri] represents that every tile j in the range li <= j <= ri is colored white.
//
// You are also given an integer carpetLen, the length of a single carpet that can be placed anywhere.
//
// Return the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.
//
// Example:
// Input: tiles = [[1,5],[10,11],[12,18],[20,25],[30,32]], carpetLen = 10
// Output: 9
// Explanation: Place the carpet starting on tile 10. 
// It covers 9 white tiles, so we return 9.
// Note that there may be other places where the carpet covers 9 white tiles.
// It can be shown that the carpet cannot cover more than 9 white tiles.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= tiles.length <= 5 * 104
// 	tiles[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= li <= ri <= 109
// 	1 <= carpetLen <= 109
// 	The tiles are non-overlapping.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It is applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered selections from a sequence.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or with a greedy approach using binary search in O(N log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or equivalent) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index `i`, `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1` found so far.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains a 'tails' array where tails[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Use binary search (specifically `lower_bound` for strictly increasing) to find the correct position to update the 'tails' array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray; elements do not need to be contiguous.; Incorrectly applying binary search (e.g., using `upper_bound` instead of `lower_bound` for strict increase).
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.

    public int maximumWhiteTiles(int[][] tiles, int carpetLen) {

            currentCovered += tiles[right][1] - tiles[right][0] + 1;

            // Move the left pointer to maintain the carpet length constraint
            while (tiles[right][1] - tiles[left][0] + 1 > carpetLen) {
                currentCovered -= tiles[left][1] - tiles[left][0] + 1;

                covered -= (tiles[right][1] - (tiles[left][0] + carpetLen - 1));
            }
