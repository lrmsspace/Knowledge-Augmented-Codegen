// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.
//
// Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
//
// Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// 	0 <= Node.val <= 104
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Heavy-light decomposition (tree, segment-tree, lca, dfs)
//   • When to use: When you need to perform path queries or updates on a tree efficiently, often involving operations like sum, min, max, or XOR on edges/nodes along a path. It transforms tree paths into linear segments for data structure application.
//   • Idea: Heavy-light decomposition partitions a tree into disjoint heavy paths and light edges, allowing tree path operations to be performed efficiently using data structures like segment trees. It typically achieves O(log^2 N) or O(log N) complexity per query/update after O(N log N) or O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: Each node belongs to exactly one heavy path.; Moving from a node to its parent via a light edge reduces the subtree size by at least half.
//   • Tips: Perform two DFS traversals: one for subtree sizes and parent pointers, another for heavy/light edges and path IDs.; Map tree nodes to a 1D array for segment tree operations based on their position in heavy paths.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying heavy edges (largest subtree size) during the first DFS.; Off-by-one errors when mapping nodes to segment tree indices or handling path boundaries.
// - Introduction to Dynamic Programming (array, tree, recursion, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, and a natural recursive solution is inefficient due to redundant computations. It's ideal for transforming exponential recursive solutions into polynomial time.
//   • Idea: Top-down dynamic programming, or memoization, optimizes recursive solutions by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This technique typically reduces time complexity from exponential to polynomial, often O(N) or O(N*M).
//   • Invariants: memo[state] contains the computed result for 'state' if memo[state] is not the sentinel value.; If memo[state] is the sentinel value, the result for 'state' has not yet been computed.
//   • Tips: Initialize the memoization table with a sentinel value (e.g., -1, null) to distinguish uncomputed states from valid zero/false results.; Use arrays for lookup tables when the state space is contiguous and small for optimal cache performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the memoization table, leading to incorrect results or infinite loops.; Incorrectly identifying or handling base cases in the recursive function.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
