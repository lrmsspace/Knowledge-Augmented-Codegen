// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-best-non-overlapping-events/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array of events where events[i] = [startTimei, endTimei, valuei]. The ith event starts at startTimei and ends at endTimei, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of valuei. You can choose at most two non-overlapping events to attend such that the sum of their values is maximized.
//
// Return this maximum sum.
//
// Note that the start time and end time is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends at the same time. More specifically, if you attend an event with end time t, the next event must start at or after t + 1.
//
// Example:
// Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[2,4,3]]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 for a sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= events.length <= 105
// 	events[i].length == 3
// 	1 <= startTimei <= endTimei <= 109
// 	1 <= valuei <= 106

// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items, each with a weight and value, to maximize total value within a limited capacity, where each item can be chosen multiple times. It is suitable for problems exhibiting optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack Problem involves selecting items to maximize total value within a fixed capacity. The complete knapsack variant, where items can be taken multiple times, is typically solved using dynamic programming in O(nW) time and O(W) space.
//   • Invariants: For 2D DP `f[i][j]`, it represents the maximum value obtainable using only the first `i` items with a total weight not exceeding `j`.; For 1D DP `dp[j]`, after processing item `i`, it stores the maximum value obtainable with a total weight not exceeding `j`, considering all items up to `i`.
//   • Tips: For the complete knapsack, iterate capacity `j` forwards (from `w_i` to `W`) when using 1D DP to allow multiple selections of the current item.; The 1D DP array `dp[j]` stores the maximum value achievable for exactly capacity `j`.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-1 knapsack with complete knapsack, especially in the 1D DP iteration direction for capacity.; Incorrectly initializing the DP array, leading to incorrect base cases or propagation.
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - Ternary Search (interval, number, binary-search, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when searching for the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a continuous or discrete interval. It efficiently narrows down the search space by evaluating the function at two internal points.
//   • Idea: Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that finds the extremum of a unimodal function within an interval by repeatedly reducing the search space by approximately one-third. It has a logarithmic time complexity, similar to binary search, but requires two function evaluations per step.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function lies within the current interval [l, r].; The function value at m1 is compared with the function value at m2.
//   • Tips: Handle discrete intervals by checking remaining points when interval size is small.; Consider Golden Section Search to reduce function evaluations per iteration.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying to non-unimodal functions.; Infinite loops if stopping condition for discrete intervals is not handled.
