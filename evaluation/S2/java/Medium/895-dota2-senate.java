// Problem Description:
// In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.
//
// The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:
//
//
// 	Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
// 	Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.
//
//
// Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.
//
// The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.
//
// Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be "Radiant" or "Dire".
//
// Example:
// Input: senate = "RD"
// Output: "Radiant"
// Explanation: 
// The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
// And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
// And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
//
// Constraints:
// n == senate.length
// 	1 <= n <= 104
// 	senate[i] is either 'R' or 'D'.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring in a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity by leveraging symmetry.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all palindromic substrings in a string by expanding around centers and utilizing symmetry to avoid redundant comparisons. It achieves a linear time complexity of O(N) by maintaining the rightmost boundary of the longest palindrome found so far.
//   • Invariants: For any index k < i, d[k] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at k.; The pair (l, r) always represents the exclusive boundaries of the palindrome that extends furthest to the right among all processed centers.
//   • Tips: Pre-process the string with delimiters (e.g., '#') to uniformly handle both odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage symmetry: for a center 'i' within the current rightmost palindrome, its mirror 'j' provides a lower bound for the palindrome length at 'i'.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when the mirror palindrome extends beyond the current rightmost palindrome.; Forgetting to update the 'l' and 'r' boundaries after finding a new palindrome that extends further to the right.
// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (ds, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently find the smallest non-negative integer not present in a dynamic sequence or range, supporting both updates and queries in logarithmic time.
//   • Idea: This technique finds the Minimal Excluded (MEX) value in a sequence by maintaining counts of distinct elements in ranges using a specialized data structure, typically a segment tree. It supports both updates and queries in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each segment tree node accurately reflects the count of distinct numbers within its corresponding range.; If a range [L, R) contains R-L distinct numbers, then all integers from L to R-1 are present.
//   • Tips: Implement a segment tree where each node stores the count of distinct numbers in its range.; The binary search for MEX checks if a range [0, k) contains k distinct numbers to decide which child to traverse.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating distinct counts in segment tree nodes, especially after updates.; Off-by-one errors when comparing the number of distinct elements with the expected count for a full range.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
