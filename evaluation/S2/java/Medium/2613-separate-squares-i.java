// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array squares. Each squares[i] = [xi, yi, li] represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.
//
// Find the minimum y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area of the squares above the line equals the total area of the squares below the line.
//
// Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
//
// Note: Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted multiple times.
//
// Example:
// Input: squares = [[0,0,1],[2,2,1]]
//
// Output: 1.00000
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
// Any horizontal line between y = 1 and y = 2 will have 1 square unit above it and 1 square unit below it. The lowest option is 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= squares.length <= 5 * 104
// 	squares[i] = [xi, yi, li]
// 	squares[i].length == 3
// 	0 <= xi, yi <= 109
// 	1 <= li <= 109
// 	The total area of all the squares will not exceed 1012.

// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - Sqrt Tree (array, tree, divide-and-conquer, recursion, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When performing associative range queries on an array, especially when O(1) query time is critical and O(N log log N) preprocessing is acceptable.
//   • Idea: The Sqrt Tree is a data structure that answers associative range queries on an array in O(1) time after O(N log log N) preprocessing. It achieves this by recursively applying sqrt decomposition, precomputing block-wise prefix/suffix operations and inter-block results.
//   • Invariants: The `prefixOp` array for any block `k` stores the associative sum from the block's start to each element within it.; The `suffixOp` array for any block `k` stores the associative sum from each element within it to the block's end.
//   • Tips: Ensure the operation is strictly associative for correctness.; Carefully handle block boundaries and partial blocks during query processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Using non-associative operations will yield incorrect results.; High memory usage for the 'between' array if not optimized or if N is very large.
// - Minimum Enclosing Circle (array, geometry, randomized, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the smallest circle that contains a given set of 2D points. It provides an expected linear time solution for this fundamental geometric problem.
//   • Idea: Welzl's algorithm finds the unique minimum enclosing circle for a set of points using a randomized incremental approach. It achieves an expected time complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: The current candidate circle `C` encloses all points `p_1, ..., p_i` processed so far.; If `p_i` is not contained in `C_{i-1}`, then `p_i` must lie on the boundary of `C_i`.
//   • Tips: Randomly permute input points to ensure expected O(N) performance.; The MEC is uniquely determined by either two points forming a diameter or three points on its boundary.
//   • Pitfalls: Not randomizing the input can lead to a worst-case O(N^3) performance.; Floating-point precision issues can cause incorrect boundary checks or point containment tests.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
