// Problem Description:
// You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length n and a positive integer k. You must choose a subsequence of indices from nums1 of length k.
//
// For chosen indices i0, i1, ..., ik - 1, your score is defined as:
//
//
// 	The sum of the selected elements from nums1 multiplied with the minimum of the selected elements from nums2.
// 	It can defined simply as: (nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1]).
//
//
// Return the maximum possible score.
//
// A subsequence of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} by deleting some or no elements.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [1,3,3,2], nums2 = [2,1,3,4], k = 3
// Output: 12
// Explanation: 
// The four possible subsequence scores are:
// - We choose the indices 0, 1, and 2 with score = (1+3+3) * min(2,1,3) = 7.
// - We choose the indices 0, 1, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,1,4) = 6. 
// - We choose the indices 0, 2, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,3,4) = 12. 
// - We choose the indices 1, 2, and 3 with score = (3+3+2) * min(1,3,4) = 8.
// Therefore, we return the max score, which is 12.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums1.length == nums2.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 105
// 	1 <= k <= n

// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items, each with a weight and value, to maximize total value within a limited capacity, where each item can be chosen multiple times. It is suitable for problems exhibiting optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack Problem involves selecting items to maximize total value within a fixed capacity. The complete knapsack variant, where items can be taken multiple times, is typically solved using dynamic programming in O(nW) time and O(W) space.
//   • Invariants: For 2D DP `f[i][j]`, it represents the maximum value obtainable using only the first `i` items with a total weight not exceeding `j`.; For 1D DP `dp[j]`, after processing item `i`, it stores the maximum value obtainable with a total weight not exceeding `j`, considering all items up to `i`.
//   • Tips: For the complete knapsack, iterate capacity `j` forwards (from `w_i` to `W`) when using 1D DP to allow multiple selections of the current item.; The 1D DP array `dp[j]` stores the maximum value achievable for exactly capacity `j`.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-1 knapsack with complete knapsack, especially in the 1D DP iteration direction for capacity.; Incorrectly initializing the DP array, leading to incorrect base cases or propagation.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use Merge Sort when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or linked lists where random access is costly.
//   • Idea: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: Each sub-array passed to merge is sorted.; The merge operation combines two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array.
//   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to maintain stability.; Consider iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: High space complexity due to auxiliary arrays.; Overhead of recursion can be significant for small inputs.
// - Minkowski sum of convex polygons (geometry, array, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to compute the sum of two convex polygons, or efficiently determine the minimum distance or intersection between them.
//   • Idea: The Minkowski sum of two convex polygons P and Q is a new convex polygon formed by vector addition of all points from P and Q. It can be computed in O(|P| + |Q|) time by merging their edge vectors.
//   • Invariants: The current edge added to the Minkowski sum is the one with the smallest angle among the remaining edges from both polygons.; The sequence of edges in the Minkowski sum maintains convexity.
//   • Tips: The vertices of P+Q are sums of vertices of P and Q.; The edges of P+Q are the edges of P and Q, sorted by angle.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like collinear edges or degenerate polygons.; Floating point precision issues in geometric calculations.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
