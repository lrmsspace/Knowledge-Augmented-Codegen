//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer n, return a binary string representing its representation in base -2.
//
// Note that the returned string should not have leading zeros unless the string is "0".
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 2
// Output: "110"
// Explantion: (-2)2 + (-2)1 = 2
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= n <= 109
//

// - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
//   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
//   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Binary Exponentiation (number, mod-exp, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating a^n efficiently, especially for large n or when results need to be taken modulo some number. It reduces the number of multiplications from linear to logarithmic.
//   • Idea: Binary exponentiation computes a^n by repeatedly squaring the base and multiplying terms corresponding to the set bits in the exponent's binary representation. This method achieves a time complexity of O(log n) multiplications.
//   • Invariants: The product of `result` and `current_base` raised to the `remaining_exponent` equals the initial `a^N`.; `current_base` always represents `a` raised to the power of `2^k` for the current iteration `k`.
//   • Tips: Handle base cases like n=0 (result is 1) and n=1 (result is a).; Use long long or appropriate large integer types for intermediate products to prevent overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Integer overflow if not using appropriate data types or modulo arithmetic.; Incorrectly handling negative exponents (typically not covered by basic binary exponentiation).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    public String baseNeg2(int n) {

        while (n != 0) {
            int remainder = n % -2;
