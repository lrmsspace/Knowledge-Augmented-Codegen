// Problem Description:
// There are n teams numbered from 0 to n - 1 in a tournament; each team is also a node in a DAG.
//
// You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed 2D integer array edges of length m representing the DAG, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is a directed edge from team ui to team vi in the graph.
//
// A directed edge from a to b in the graph means that team a is stronger than team b and team b is weaker than team a.
//
// Team a will be the champion of the tournament if there is no team b that is stronger than team a.
//
// Return the team that will be the champion of the tournament if there is a unique champion, otherwise, return -1.
//
// Notes
//
//
// 	A cycle is a series of nodes a1, a2, ..., an, an+1 such that node a1 is the same node as node an+1, the nodes a1, a2, ..., an are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node ai to node ai+1 for every i in the range [1, n].
// 	A DAG is a directed graph that does not have any cycle.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: Team 1 is weaker than team 0. Team 2 is weaker than team 1. So the champion is team 0.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 100
// 	m == edges.length
// 	0 <= m <= n * (n - 1) / 2
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= edge[i][j] <= n - 1
// 	edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]
// 	The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b, team b is not stronger than team a.
// 	The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b and team b is stronger than team c, then team a is stronger than team c.

// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
// - Finding a negative cycle in the graph (graph, matrix, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find if a negative cycle exists in a graph, especially when dealing with all-pairs shortest paths or when edge weights can be negative. It is suitable for dense graphs.
//   • Idea: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can detect negative cycles by checking if any vertex has a negative distance to itself after all iterations. It computes all-pairs shortest paths in O(V^3) time.
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, dist[i][j] stores the shortest path from i to j using only intermediate vertices from 0 to k-1.; For any i, dist[i][i] remains 0 unless a negative cycle involving i is found.
//   • Tips: Initialize distance matrix with edge weights or infinity for non-existent edges.; Set dist[i][i] to 0 for all i initially.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect initialization of the distance matrix, especially dist[i][i].; Forgetting to check the main diagonal for negative values after computation.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int findChampion(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Create an array to track the in-degree of each team
        int[] inDegree = new int[n];
        
        // Calculate the in-degree for each team based on the edges
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            inDegree[edge[1]]++;
        }
        
        // Find the team with zero in-degree (potential champion)
        int champion = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                if (champion != -1) {
                    // More than one team with zero in-degree, no unique champion
                    return -1;
                }
                champion = i;
