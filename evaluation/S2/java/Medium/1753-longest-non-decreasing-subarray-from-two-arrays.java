//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of length n.
//
// Let's define another 0-indexed integer array, nums3, of length n. For each index i in the range [0, n - 1], you can assign either nums1[i] or nums2[i] to nums3[i].
//
// Your task is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray in nums3 by choosing its values optimally.
//
// Return an integer representing the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray in nums3.
//
// Note: A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [2,3,1], nums2 = [1,2,1]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: One way to construct nums3 is: 
// nums3 = [nums1[0], nums2[1], nums2[2]] => [2,2,1]. 
// The subarray starting from index 0 and ending at index 1, [2,2], forms a non-decreasing subarray of length 2. 
// We can show that 2 is the maximum achievable length.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums1.length == nums2.length == n <= 105
// 	1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109
//

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It is applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered selections from a sequence.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or with a greedy approach using binary search in O(N log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or equivalent) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index `i`, `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1` found so far.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains a 'tails' array where tails[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Use binary search (specifically `lower_bound` for strictly increasing) to find the correct position to update the 'tails' array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray; elements do not need to be contiguous.; Incorrectly applying binary search (e.g., using `upper_bound` instead of `lower_bound` for strict increase).
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, number, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the optimal sequence of jobs to minimize the total completion time (makespan) on two machines, with a fixed processing order (machine 1 then machine 2) for all jobs.
//   • Idea: This problem involves ordering N jobs, each with two processing times (one for each machine), to minimize the overall makespan. Johnson's rule provides an optimal greedy solution for this specific two-machine flow shop problem in O(N log N) or O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed so far maintain the optimal relative order determined by Johnson's rule.; The current makespan is the minimum possible for the jobs already scheduled.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs based on Johnson's rule criteria: jobs with min(a_i, b_i).; Prioritize jobs with shorter machine 1 times or longer machine 2 times for early scheduling.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying Johnson's rule to problems with more than two machines, where it is not optimal.; Incorrectly sorting jobs within the two partitioned sets.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.

    public int maxNonDecreasingLength(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        int maxLength = 1; // At least one element can always form a non-decreasing subarray
        int currentLength = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            // Check if we can choose nums1[i] or nums2[i] to maintain non-decreasing order
            if ((nums1[i] >= nums1[i - 1] || nums1[i] >= nums2[i - 1]) &&
                (nums2[i] >= nums1[i - 1] || nums2[i] >= nums2[i - 1])) {
                currentLength++;
            } else {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
                currentLength = 1; // Reset for the new subarray
            }

        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
