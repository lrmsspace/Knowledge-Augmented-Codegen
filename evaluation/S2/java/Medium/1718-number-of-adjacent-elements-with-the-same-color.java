//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n representing an array colors of length n where all elements are set to 0's meaning uncolored. You are also given a 2D integer array queries where queries[i] = [indexi, colori]. For the ith query:
//
//
// 	Set colors[indexi] to colori.
// 	Count the number of adjacent pairs in colors which have the same color (regardless of colori).
//
//
// Return an array answer of the same length as queries where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, queries = [[0,2],[1,2],[3,1],[1,1],[2,1]]
//
// Output: [0,1,1,0,2]
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	Initially array colors = [0,0,0,0], where 0 denotes uncolored elements of the array.
// 	After the 1st query colors = [2,0,0,0]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.
// 	After the 2nd query colors = [2,2,0,0]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 1.
// 	After the 3rd query colors = [2,2,0,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 1.
// 	After the 4th query colors = [2,1,0,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 0.
// 	After the 5th query colors = [2,1,1,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with the same color is 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	queries[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= indexi <= n - 1
// 	1 <=  colori <= 105

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, number, sparse-table, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries on a static array in O(1) time, after an initial O(N log N) preprocessing phase. It is particularly efficient for associative operations like sum, min, or max.
//   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes results for all possible range queries on a static array using a hierarchical block decomposition. It achieves O(N log N) construction time and space complexity, enabling O(1) query time for associative operations.
//   • Invariants: ST[k][i] stores the result for a range of length 2^k starting at i within its block.; For any level k, blocks are disjoint, but ranges within ST[k] can overlap with ranges in ST[k-1].
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values or highest set bit for efficient level determination.; Ensure the operation (e.g., sum, min, max) is associative for correct combination.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for arrays that require updates, as it's a static data structure.; Only works for associative operations; non-associative operations cannot be combined this way.
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
