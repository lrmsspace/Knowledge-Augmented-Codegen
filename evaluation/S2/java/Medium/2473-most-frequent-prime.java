//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a m x n 0-indexed 2D matrix mat. From every cell, you can create numbers in the following way:
//
//
// 	There could be at most 8 paths from the cells namely: east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north, and north-east.
// 	Select a path from them and append digits in this path to the number being formed by traveling in this direction.
// 	Note that numbers are generated at every step, for example, if the digits along the path are 1, 9, 1, then there will be three numbers generated along the way: 1, 19, 191.
//
//
// Return the most frequent prime number greater than 10 out of all the numbers created by traversing the matrix or -1 if no such prime number exists. If there are multiple prime numbers with the highest frequency, then return the largest among them.
//
// Note: It is invalid to change the direction during the move.
//
// Example:
// Input: mat = [[1,1],[9,9],[1,1]]
// Output: 19
// Explanation: 
// From cell (0,0) there are 3 possible directions and the numbers greater than 10 which can be created in those directions are:
// East: [11], South-East: [19], South: [19,191].
// Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,1) in all possible directions are: [19,191,19,11].
// Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,0) in all possible directions are: [99,91,91,91,91].
// Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,1) in all possible directions are: [91,91,99,91,91].
// Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,0) in all possible directions are: [11,19,191,19].
// Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,1) in all possible directions are: [11,19,19,191].
// The most frequent prime number among all the created numbers is 19.
//
// Constraints:
// m == mat.length
// 	n == mat[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 6
// 	1 <= mat[i][j] <= 9

// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
