// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-number-of-fruits-collected/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a game dungeon comprised of n x n rooms arranged in a grid.
//
// You are given a 2D array fruits of size n x n, where fruits[i][j] represents the number of fruits in the room (i, j). Three children will play in the game dungeon, with initial positions at the corner rooms (0, 0), (0, n - 1), and (n - 1, 0).
//
// The children will make exactly n - 1 moves according to the following rules to reach the room (n - 1, n - 1):
//
//
// 	The child starting from (0, 0) must move from their current room (i, j) to one of the rooms (i + 1, j + 1), (i + 1, j), and (i, j + 1) if the target room exists.
// 	The child starting from (0, n - 1) must move from their current room (i, j) to one of the rooms (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j), and (i + 1, j + 1) if the target room exists.
// 	The child starting from (n - 1, 0) must move from their current room (i, j) to one of the rooms (i - 1, j + 1), (i, j + 1), and (i + 1, j + 1) if the target room exists.
//
//
// When a child enters a room, they will collect all the fruits there. If two or more children enter the same room, only one child will collect the fruits, and the room will be emptied after they leave.
//
// Return the maximum number of fruits the children can collect from the dungeon.
//
// Example:
// Input: fruits = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,8,7],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]]
//
// Output: 100
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
// In this example:
//
//
// 	The 1st child (green) moves on the path (0,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,2) -> (3, 3).
// 	The 2nd child (red) moves on the path (0,3) -> (1,2) -> (2,3) -> (3, 3).
// 	The 3rd child (blue) moves on the path (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3, 3).
//
//
// In total they collect 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 100 fruits.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n == fruits.length == fruits[i].length <= 1000
// 	0 <= fruits[i][j] <= 1000

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
//   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
//   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).
// - Calculating the determinant using Kraut method in O(N^3) (matrix, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this method to compute the determinant of a square matrix efficiently by decomposing it into lower and upper triangular matrices. It is suitable for problems requiring O(N^3) complexity for matrix operations.
//   • Idea: The Kraut method computes the determinant of a square matrix by first decomposing it into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U), such that A = LU. The determinant is then the product of the diagonal elements of L and U, achieving O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After processing column k, the first k columns of L and first k rows of U are correctly computed.; For any i <= k and j <= k, the partial sum for A[i][j] from L and U elements up to index min(i,j) is maintained.
//   • Tips: Ensure the input matrix is square for determinant calculation.; The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: Division by zero can occur if a pivot element is zero, requiring pivoting strategies.; Floating-point precision issues can accumulate, especially for large matrices.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
