//
// Problem Description:
// There is an 8 x 8 chessboard containing n pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array pieces of length n, where pieces[i] describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the ith piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array positions also of length n, where positions[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that the ith piece is currently at the 1-based coordinate (ri, ci) on the chessboard.
//
// When making a move for a piece, you choose a destination square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.
//
//
// 	A rook can only travel horizontally or vertically from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), or (r, c-1).
// 	A queen can only travel horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1), (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).
// 	A bishop can only travel diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).
//
//
// You must make a move for every piece on the board simultaneously. A move combination consists of all the moves performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel one square towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the 0th second. A move combination is invalid if, at a given time, two or more pieces occupy the same square.
//
// Return the number of valid move combinations​​​​​.
//
// Notes:
//
//
// 	No two pieces will start in the same square.
// 	You may choose the square a piece is already on as its destination.
// 	If two pieces are directly adjacent to each other, it is valid for them to move past each other and swap positions in one second.
//
// Example:
// Input: pieces = ["rook"], positions = [[1,1]]
// Output: 15
// Explanation: The image above shows the possible squares the piece can move to.
//
// Constraints:
// n == pieces.length 
// 	n == positions.length
// 	1 <= n <= 4
// 	pieces only contains the strings "rook", "queen", and "bishop".
// 	There will be at most one queen on the chessboard.
// 	1 <= ri, ci <= 8
// 	Each positions[i] is distinct.

// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, counting, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when counting non-attacking piece placements on a grid, especially when the problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems based on board properties like diagonals.
//   • Idea: This algorithm employs 2D dynamic programming to count the total number of ways to place non-attacking bishops on a chessboard. It leverages the independence of placements on black and white squares/diagonals, achieving a polynomial time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any diagonal `i`, `D[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonal `i`.; Bishops placed on black diagonals do not attack bishops placed on white diagonals.
//   • Tips: Decompose the problem into independent subproblems for black and white squares/diagonals.; Identify the state for DP, typically `dp[diagonal_index][bishops_placed]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the number of squares on each diagonal.; Overlapping bishops if diagonal definitions are not precise.
// - Manhattan Distance (geometry, graph, sweep-line, mst-kruskal, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use this when finding the Minimum Spanning Tree for points in a 2D plane where edge weights are Manhattan distances, or when a geometric problem can be simplified by transforming Manhattan to Chebyshev distance.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Tree for points in a 2D plane using Manhattan distance. It leverages a sweep-line approach to efficiently find nearest neighbors in specific octants, reducing the number of candidate edges for Kruskal's algorithm, achieving O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any point 's' in the active set, its nearest neighbor in the current octant has not yet been processed.; Points are processed in non-decreasing order of 'x + y' (or transformed coordinate), ensuring local optimality for distances.
//   • Tips: Consider transforming Manhattan distance problems into Chebyshev distance problems using (x+y, y-x) coordinates.; Divide the plane into 8 octants around each point to simplify nearest neighbor searches.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining or handling the 8 octants, especially near boundaries or for points with equal coordinates.; Inefficiently managing the 'active set' during the sweep-line, leading to higher than O(N log N) complexity.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
