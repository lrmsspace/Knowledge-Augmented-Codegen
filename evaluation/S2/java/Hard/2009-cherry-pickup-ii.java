// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/cherry-pickup-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a rows x cols matrix grid representing a field of cherries where grid[i][j] represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the (i, j) cell.
//
// You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:
//
//
// 	Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and
// 	Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0, cols - 1).
//
//
// Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below:
//
//
// 	From a cell (i, j), robots can move to cell (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j), or (i + 1, j + 1).
// 	When any robot passes through a cell, It picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.
// 	When both robots stay in the same cell, only one takes the cherries.
// 	Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.
// 	Both robots should reach the bottom row in grid.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]
// Output: 24
// Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
// Cherries taken by Robot #1, (3 + 2 + 5 + 2) = 12.
// Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 5 + 5 + 1) = 12.
// Total of cherries: 12 + 12 = 24.
//
// Constraints:
// rows == grid.length
// 	cols == grid[i].length
// 	2 <= rows, cols <= 70
// 	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
//   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
//   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.
// - Hungarian algorithm for solving the assignment problem (matrix, graph, array, greedy, bfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when finding a minimum cost perfect matching in a bipartite graph, typically represented as an N x N cost matrix, where each row must be assigned to exactly one column.
//   • Idea: The Hungarian algorithm finds a minimum weight perfect matching in a bipartite graph, solving the assignment problem for an N x N cost matrix. It iteratively finds augmenting paths in an equality graph and adjusts potentials, achieving O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For all i, j, u[i] + v[j] <= A[i][j] (potential condition).; The current matching is always valid (each row/column used at most once).
//   • Tips: Understand the concept of potentials and their role in maintaining the equality graph.; The algorithm can be adapted for maximum profit problems by negating costs.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating potentials can lead to non-optimal solutions or infinite loops.; Handling non-square matrices requires careful padding with dummy values.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
