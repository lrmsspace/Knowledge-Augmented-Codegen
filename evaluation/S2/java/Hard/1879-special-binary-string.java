// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/special-binary-string/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Special binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:
//
//
// 	The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.
// 	Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.
//
//
// You are given a special binary string s.
//
// A move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of s, and swapping them. Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.
//
// Return the lexicographically largest resulting string possible after applying the mentioned operations on the string.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "11011000"
// Output: "11100100"
// Explanation: The strings "10" [occuring at s[1]] and "1100" [at s[3]] are swapped.
// This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 50
// 	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
// 	s is a special binary string.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (array, stack, monotonic-stack, max-window)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to find the largest rectangular submatrix composed entirely of zeros within a binary matrix. It efficiently reduces the 2D problem to a series of 1D largest rectangle in histogram problems.
//   • Idea: The algorithm transforms a 2D matrix problem into a series of 1D 'largest rectangle in histogram' problems, one for each row. It uses a monotonic stack to find the nearest smaller elements for each bar in O(N) time, leading to an overall O(N*M) complexity for the 2D problem.
//   • Invariants: The stack always stores indices of elements in strictly increasing order of their corresponding heights.; When an element is popped from the stack, the element below it is its nearest smaller element to the left.
//   • Tips: Precompute heights for each column, representing consecutive zeros upwards from the current row.; The 2D problem is effectively reduced to finding the largest rectangle in a histogram for each row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when using the stack (e.g., empty stack, end of array).; Off-by-one errors when calculating the width of the rectangle (k2 - k1 - 1).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public String makeLargestSpecial(String s) {
        int count = 0, start = 0;
        List<String> subs = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            count += s.charAt(i) == '1' ? 1 : -1;

            if (count == 0) {
                // Recursively process the inner substring and add the special string to the list
                subs.add("1" + makeLargestSpecial(s.substring(start + 1, i)) + "0");
                start = i + 1; // Move to the next segment
            }
        }

        // Sort the list of special strings in reverse lexicographical order
        Collections.sort(subs, Collections.reverseOrder());

        // Concatenate all sorted special strings to form the final result
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (String sub : subs) {
            result.append(sub);
        }

        return result.toString();           
    }
