// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-maximize-score/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array nums of n positive integers and an integer k.
//
// Initially, you start with a score of 1. You have to maximize your score by applying the following operation at most k times:
//
//
// 	Choose any non-empty subarray nums[l, ..., r] that you haven't chosen previously.
// 	Choose an element x of nums[l, ..., r] with the highest prime score. If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index.
// 	Multiply your score by x.
//
//
// Here, nums[l, ..., r] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at the index r, both ends being inclusive.
//
// The prime score of an integer x is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of x. For example, the prime score of 300 is 3 since 300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5.
//
// Return the maximum possible score after applying at most k operations.
//
// Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2
// Output: 81
// Explanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:
// - Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 1 * 9 = 9.
// - Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 1, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 9 * 9 = 81.
// It can be proven that 81 is the highest score one can obtain.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length == n <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= k <= min(n * (n + 1) / 2, 109)
//

// - Binomial Coefficients (array, number, dp-1d, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating binomial coefficients C(n, k) modulo a composite number M, especially when M is not prime and direct modular inverse computation for factorials is not possible.
//   • Idea: This technique computes binomial coefficients modulo an arbitrary composite number M by factoring M into prime powers. For each prime power, it calculates prime exponents in factorials and combines coprime parts, then uses Chinese Remainder Theorem.
//   • Invariants: For any `i <= N`, `c[i]` correctly stores the exponent of prime `p` in `i!`.; For any `i <= N`, `g[i]` correctly stores `(i! / p^c[i]) % (p^b)`.
//   • Tips: Precompute factorials and their prime exponents up to N using dynamic programming.; Apply Legendre's formula to efficiently find the exponent of a prime 'p' in 'x!'.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly factorize the modulus 'M' into its prime power components.; Incorrectly computing modular inverses when a number is not coprime to the modulus.
// - Integer factorization (number, array, enumeration, sieve, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find the prime factors of a composite number, especially for relatively small numbers or as a base case for more advanced algorithms.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the prime factorization of an integer by iteratively dividing it by its smallest prime factors. It typically checks divisors up to the square root of the number, achieving an O(sqrt(N)) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The product of all found prime factors multiplied by the current remaining number equals the original input number.; All prime factors found so far are less than or equal to the current divisor being tested.
//   • Tips: Perform a primality test first to avoid unnecessary factorization attempts.; Only check divisors up to the square root of the number.
//   • Pitfalls: Trial division is pseudo-polynomial time, making it inefficient for very large numbers.; Forgetting to handle the case where the remaining number after division is itself a prime greater than its original square root.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    public int maximumScore(List<Integer> nums, int k) {
        // Step 1: Build the graph as an adjacency list
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            graph.get(i).add(i + 1);
            graph.get(i + 1).add(i);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Perform a DFS to find the maximum score
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[nums.size()];
        return dfs(graph, nums, visited, k, 0);
