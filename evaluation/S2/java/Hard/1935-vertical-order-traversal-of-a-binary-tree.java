// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
//
// For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0).
//
// The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.
//
// Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
// Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
// Explanation:
// Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.
// Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.
// Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.
// Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
// 	0 <= Node.val <= 1000

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, quickselect)
//   • When to use: Use when maintaining an ordered collection of elements that requires efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. It is also suitable for finding minimum, maximum, floor, and ceiling values.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Core operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(h) time, where h is the tree's height.
//   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are less than its own key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are greater than its own key.
//   • Tips: Maintain subtree sizes for order-statistic operations like finding the k-th smallest element.; Consider self-balancing variants (AVL, Red-Black) to guarantee O(log N) worst-case performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade to O(N) performance for all operations.; Forgetting to update parent pointers or subtree sizes during modifications.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
