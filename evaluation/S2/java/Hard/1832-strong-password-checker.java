// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/strong-password-checker/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// A password is considered strong if the below conditions are all met:
//
//
// 	It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
// 	It contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.
// 	It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., "Baaabb0" is weak, but "Baaba0" is strong).
//
//
// Given a string password, return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong. if password is already strong, return 0.
//
// In one step, you can:
//
//
// 	Insert one character to password,
// 	Delete one character from password, or
// 	Replace one character of password with another character.
//
// Example:
// Input: password = "a"
// Output: 5
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= password.length <= 50
// 	password consists of letters, digits, dot '.' or exclamation mark '!'.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare strings or substrings, especially in scenarios involving large texts or numerous comparisons. It's also useful for pattern matching and detecting duplicates in collections of strings.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string into a numerical value (hash) to enable fast comparisons and lookups. This technique typically uses polynomial hashing with a base and a modulus, offering O(L) for initial hash computation and O(1) for substring hashes after O(N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: The hash of a string S of length L is (S[0]*P^(L-1) + S[1]*P^(L-2) + ... + S[L-1]*P^0) % M.; For any substring S[i...j], its hash can be derived from precomputed prefix hashes in O(1) time.
//   • Tips: Use multiple hash functions with different bases and moduli to reduce collision probability.; Choose a large prime modulus (e.g., 10^9 + 7) and a random base for robustness.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions are possible; always verify equality for critical applications or use multiple hashes.; Choosing a small or non-prime modulus significantly increases the risk of collisions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
