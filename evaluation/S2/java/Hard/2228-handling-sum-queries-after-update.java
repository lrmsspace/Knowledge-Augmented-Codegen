//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two 0-indexed arrays nums1 and nums2 and a 2D array queries of queries. There are three types of queries:
//
//
// 	For a query of type 1, queries[i] = [1, l, r]. Flip the values from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0 in nums1 from index l to index r. Both l and r are 0-indexed.
// 	For a query of type 2, queries[i] = [2, p, 0]. For every index 0 <= i < n, set nums2[i] = nums2[i] + nums1[i] * p.
// 	For a query of type 3, queries[i] = [3, 0, 0]. Find the sum of the elements in nums2.
//
//
// Return an array containing all the answers to the third type queries.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [1,0,1], nums2 = [0,0,0], queries = [[1,1,1],[2,1,0],[3,0,0]]
// Output: [3]
// Explanation: After the first query nums1 becomes [1,1,1]. After the second query, nums2 becomes [1,1,1], so the answer to the third query is 3. Thus, [3] is returned.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums1.length,nums2.length <= 105
// 	nums1.length = nums2.length
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	queries[i].length = 3
// 	0 <= l <= r <= nums1.length - 1
// 	0 <= p <= 106
// 	0 <= nums1[i] <= 1
// 	0 <= nums2[i] <= 109

// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It provides logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that can efficiently update individual elements and calculate prefix sums in an array. Both operations are performed in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each `tree[i]` element stores the sum of a contiguous range of elements from the original array, specifically from `i - (i & -i) + 1` to `i` (inclusive, 1-based).; After any `update(idx, val)` operation, `query(idx)` will reflect the new sum up to `idx`.
//   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for array elements to simplify bitwise logic; The `idx & -idx` operation is key to navigating the implicit tree structure
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-based and 1-based indexing can lead to incorrect results; Off-by-one errors when calculating range sums (e.g., `query(R) - query(L-1)`)
// - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to perform many range queries on a static array, especially when the query operation is associative and idempotent, allowing for O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
//   • Idea: A Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths. It allows O(1) query time for idempotent operations like min/max/gcd and O(log N) for non-idempotent associative operations, after an O(N log N) build time.
//   • Invariants: After precomputation, dp[k][i] stores the result for the range [i, i + 2^k - 1].; For any k > 0, dp[k][i] is the result of combining dp[k-1][i] and dp[k-1][i + 2^(k-1)].
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values for faster range length calculations.; Store dp[k][i] as the result for range [i, i + 2^k - 1].
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to array elements efficiently.; Requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.
// - Operations on polynomials and series (array, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to model and solve combinatorial counting problems using algebraic methods, especially when dealing with recurrence relations or products of independent choices. It's also useful for analyzing properties of sequences.
//   • Idea: This involves performing algebraic operations like addition, multiplication, and composition on polynomials or formal power series, represented by coefficients. These operations model combinatorial structures and solve recurrence relations, typically with complexities from O(N) to O(N log N).
//   • Invariants: The array `coefficients[i]` stores the coefficient of `x^i` for the current polynomial.; For any intermediate product `C(x) = A(x) * B(x)`, the coefficient `C[k]` correctly accumulates `A[i] * B[j]` for all `i+j=k`.
//   • Tips: Represent polynomials as arrays of coefficients; Understand the combinatorial meaning of operations (e.g., product for independent choices)
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing ordinary and exponential generating functions; Incorrectly applying convolution for non-independent events
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
