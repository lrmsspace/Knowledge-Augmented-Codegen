// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/alternating-groups-iii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There are some red and blue tiles arranged circularly. You are given an array of integers colors and a 2D integers array queries.
//
// The color of tile i is represented by colors[i]:
//
//
//  colors[i] == 0 means that tile i is red.
//  colors[i] == 1 means that tile i is blue.
//
//
// An alternating group is a contiguous subset of tiles in the circle with alternating colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one has a different color from its adjacent tiles in the group).
//
// You have to process queries of two types:
//
//
//  queries[i] = [1, sizei], determine the count of alternating groups with size sizei.
//  queries[i] = [2, indexi, colori], change colors[indexi] to colori.
//
//
// Return an array answer containing the results of the queries of the first type in order.
//
// Note that since colors represents a circle, the first and the last tiles are considered to be next to each other.
//
// Example:
// Input: colors = [0,1,1,0,1], queries = [[2,1,0],[1,4]]
//
// Output: [2]
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
// First query:
//
// Change colors[1] to 0.
//
//
//
// Second query:
//
// Count of the alternating groups with size 4:
//
// Constraints:
// 4 <= colors.length <= 5 * 104
//  0 <= colors[i] <= 1
//  1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 104
//  queries[i][0] == 1 or queries[i][0] == 2
//  For all i that:
//  
//   queries[i][0] == 1: queries[i].length == 2, 3 <= queries[i][1] <= colors.length - 1
//   queries[i][0] == 2: queries[i].length == 3, 0 <= queries[i][1] <= colors.length - 1, 0 <= queries[i][2] <= 1
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
