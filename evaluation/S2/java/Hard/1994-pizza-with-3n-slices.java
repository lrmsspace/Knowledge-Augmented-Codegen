// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/pizza-with-3n-slices/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a pizza with 3n slices of varying size, you and your friends will take slices of pizza as follows:
//
//
// 	You will pick any pizza slice.
// 	Your friend Alice will pick the next slice in the anti-clockwise direction of your pick.
// 	Your friend Bob will pick the next slice in the clockwise direction of your pick.
// 	Repeat until there are no more slices of pizzas.
//
//
// Given an integer array slices that represent the sizes of the pizza slices in a clockwise direction, return the maximum possible sum of slice sizes that you can pick.
//
// Example:
// Input: slices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
// Output: 10
// Explanation: Pick pizza slice of size 4, Alice and Bob will pick slices with size 3 and 5 respectively. Then Pick slices with size 6, finally Alice and Bob will pick slice of size 2 and 1 respectively. Total = 4 + 6.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 * n == slices.length
// 	1 <= slices.length <= 500
// 	1 <= slices[i] <= 1000

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in order. It is efficient for both convex and non-convex polygons.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing signed trapezoidal areas formed by each edge and the x-axis, or equivalently, using the shoelace formula. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of vertices.
//   • Invariants: Vertices are processed sequentially in their given order, forming edges.; The running sum `current_sum` accumulates the signed contribution from each edge processed so far.
//   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in a consistent order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; Use a data type with sufficient range (e.g., long long or double) for intermediate sums to prevent overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect vertex order will result in an incorrect signed area or even zero.; Integer overflow can occur if coordinates are large and sums exceed standard integer limits.
// - Ternary Search (interval, number, binary-search, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when searching for the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a continuous or discrete interval. It efficiently narrows down the search space by evaluating the function at two internal points.
//   • Idea: Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that finds the extremum of a unimodal function within an interval by repeatedly reducing the search space by approximately one-third. It has a logarithmic time complexity, similar to binary search, but requires two function evaluations per step.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function lies within the current interval [l, r].; The function value at m1 is compared with the function value at m2.
//   • Tips: Handle discrete intervals by checking remaining points when interval size is small.; Consider Golden Section Search to reduce function evaluations per iteration.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying to non-unimodal functions.; Infinite loops if stopping condition for discrete intervals is not handled.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
