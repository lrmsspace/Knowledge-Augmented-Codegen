//
// Problem Description:
// Given a matrix and a target, return the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to target.
//
// A submatrix x1, y1, x2, y2 is the set of all cells matrix[x][y] with x1 <= x <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2.
//
// Two submatrices (x1, y1, x2, y2) and (x1', y1', x2', y2') are different if they have some coordinate that is different: for example, if x1 != x1'.
//
// Example:
// Input: matrix = [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]], target = 0
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The four 1x1 submatrices that only contain 0.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= matrix.length <= 100
// 	1 <= matrix[0].length <= 100
// 	-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000
// 	-10^8 <= target <= 10^8

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
