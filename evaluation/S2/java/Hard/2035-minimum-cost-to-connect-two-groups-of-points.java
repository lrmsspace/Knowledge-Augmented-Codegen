// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-connect-two-groups-of-points/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two groups of points where the first group has size1 points, the second group has size2 points, and size1 >= size2.
//
// The cost of the connection between any two points are given in an size1 x size2 matrix where cost[i][j] is the cost of connecting point i of the first group and point j of the second group. The groups are connected if each point in both groups is connected to one or more points in the opposite group. In other words, each point in the first group must be connected to at least one point in the second group, and each point in the second group must be connected to at least one point in the first group.
//
// Return the minimum cost it takes to connect the two groups.
//
// Example:
// Input: cost = [[15, 96], [36, 2]]
// Output: 17
// Explanation: The optimal way of connecting the groups is:
// 1--A
// 2--B
// This results in a total cost of 17.
//
// Constraints:
// size1 == cost.length
// 	size2 == cost[i].length
// 	1 <= size1, size2 <= 12
// 	size1 >= size2
// 	0 <= cost[i][j] <= 100

// - Hungarian algorithm for solving the assignment problem (matrix, graph, array, greedy, bfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when finding a minimum cost perfect matching in a bipartite graph, typically represented as an N x N cost matrix, where each row must be assigned to exactly one column.
//   • Idea: The Hungarian algorithm finds a minimum weight perfect matching in a bipartite graph, solving the assignment problem for an N x N cost matrix. It iteratively finds augmenting paths in an equality graph and adjusts potentials, achieving O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For all i, j, u[i] + v[j] <= A[i][j] (potential condition).; The current matching is always valid (each row/column used at most once).
//   • Tips: Understand the concept of potentials and their role in maintaining the equality graph.; The algorithm can be adapted for maximum profit problems by negating costs.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating potentials can lead to non-optimal solutions or infinite loops.; Handling non-square matrices requires careful padding with dummy values.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
