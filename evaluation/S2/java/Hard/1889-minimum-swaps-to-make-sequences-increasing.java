// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-make-sequences-increasing/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two integer arrays of the same length nums1 and nums2. In one operation, you are allowed to swap nums1[i] with nums2[i].
//
//
// 	For example, if nums1 = [1,2,3,8], and nums2 = [5,6,7,4], you can swap the element at i = 3 to obtain nums1 = [1,2,3,4] and nums2 = [5,6,7,8].
//
//
// Return the minimum number of needed operations to make nums1 and nums2 strictly increasing. The test cases are generated so that the given input always makes it possible.
//
// An array arr is strictly increasing if and only if arr[0] < arr[1] < arr[2] < ... < arr[arr.length - 1].
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [1,3,5,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,7]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: 
// Swap nums1[3] and nums2[3]. Then the sequences are:
// nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 7] and nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
// which are both strictly increasing.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums1.length <= 105
// 	nums2.length == nums1.length
// 	0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 2 * 105

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
// - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
//   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
//   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
//   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int minSwap(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        int keep = 0; // Minimum swaps if we keep the current index as is
        int swap = 1; // Minimum swaps if we swap the current index

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int newKeep = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            int newSwap = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

            // Check if the current elements are in increasing order without swapping
            if (nums1[i] > nums1[i - 1] && nums2[i] > nums2[i - 1]) {
                newKeep = Math.min(newKeep, keep);
                newSwap = Math.min(newSwap, swap + 1);
            }

            // Check if the current elements are in increasing order with swapping
            if (nums1[i] > nums2[i - 1] && nums2[i] > nums1[i - 1]) {
                newKeep = Math.min(newKeep, swap);
                newSwap = Math.min(newSwap, keep + 1);
