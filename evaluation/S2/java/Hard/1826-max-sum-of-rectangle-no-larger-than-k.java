// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-sum-of-rectangle-no-larger-than-k/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an m x n matrix matrix and an integer k, return the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.
//
// It is guaranteed that there will be a rectangle with a sum no larger than k.
//
// Example:
// Input: matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Because the sum of the blue rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2, and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
//
// Constraints:
// m == matrix.length
// 	n == matrix[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 100
// 	-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100
// 	-105 <= k <= 105
//

// Follow up: What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
// - Calculating the determinant of a matrix by Gauss (matrix, number, simulation, counting)
//   • When to use: When needing to compute the determinant of a square matrix, especially when Gaussian elimination is a familiar or efficient approach. It is suitable for matrices where direct cofactor expansion is computationally too expensive.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes the determinant of a square matrix by transforming it into an upper triangular form using Gaussian elimination. The determinant is the product of diagonal elements, adjusted by a sign factor from row swaps, with O(N^3) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Before processing column 'k', all elements A[i][j] where i > j and j < k are zero.; The determinant of the current matrix, multiplied by (-1)^swaps, equals the original matrix's determinant.
//   • Tips: Track the number of row swaps to correctly determine the determinant's sign.; Pivot selection can improve numerical stability, especially with floating-point numbers.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to adjust the sign after row exchanges.; Division by zero if a pivot element is zero, requiring a row swap.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
