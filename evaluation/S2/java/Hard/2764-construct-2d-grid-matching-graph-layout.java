// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-2d-grid-matching-graph-layout/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array edges representing an undirected graph having n nodes, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes an edge between nodes ui and vi.
//
// Construct a 2D grid that satisfies these conditions:
//
//
// 	The grid contains all nodes from 0 to n - 1 in its cells, with each node appearing exactly once.
// 	Two nodes should be in adjacent grid cells (horizontally or vertically) if and only if there is an edge between them in edges.
//
//
// It is guaranteed that edges can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.
//
// Return a 2D integer array satisfying the conditions above. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
//
// Output: [[3,1],[2,0]]
//
// Explanation:
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= edges.length <= 105
// 	edges[i] = [ui, vi]
// 	0 <= ui < vi < n
// 	All the edges are distinct.
// 	The input is generated such that edges can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.

// - Undirected Graphs (graph, array, simulation)
//   • When to use: When modeling symmetric relationships between entities and needing to explore, analyze connectivity, or find paths within the network. Useful for problems involving reachability or structural properties.
//   • Idea: Undirected graphs represent symmetric relationships between pairs of vertices. Simulation on them involves systematically exploring or processing these connections, often with O(V+E) complexity for basic traversals.
//   • Invariants: All vertices reachable from the source within 'k' edges have been processed by the 'k'-th step of BFS.; Each edge in the graph is traversed at most twice (once for each direction) during a full graph traversal.
//   • Tips: Use an adjacency list for sparse graphs to optimize space and traversal time.; Use an adjacency matrix for dense graphs or when O(1) edge existence checks are critical.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected components, leading to incomplete graph processing.; Incorrectly representing undirected edges (e.g., only adding one direction to an adjacency list).
// - Finding Bridges Online (ds, tree, union-find, lca, rerooting)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to dynamically maintain bridges and 2-edge-connected components in a graph as edges are added. It efficiently processes edge additions by updating forest structures and compressing cycles.
//   • Idea: This algorithm dynamically maintains bridges and 2-edge-connected components using two DSU structures and a parent array for tree structure. Edge additions involve re-rooting smaller trees and compressing cycles via LCA, achieving amortized O(log N) per edge operation.
//   • Invariants: The par[] array always defines a forest structure where each tree corresponds to a connected component of 2-edge-connected components.; Each 2-edge-connected component is represented by a single canonical element in its dedicated DSU structure.
//   • Tips: Employ two DSU structures: one for connected components and another for 2-edge-connected components.; Optimize re-rooting operations by always re-rooting the smaller of the two trees being joined.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to consistently update both DSU structures and the parent array after operations.; Incorrectly handling parent pointers during re-rooting, leading to broken tree structures.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
