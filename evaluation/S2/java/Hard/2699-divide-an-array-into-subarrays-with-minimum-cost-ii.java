// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-an-array-into-subarrays-with-minimum-cost-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n, and two positive integers k and dist.
//
// The cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost of [1,2,3] is 1 while the cost of [3,4,1] is 3.
//
// You need to divide nums into k disjoint contiguous subarrays, such that the difference between the starting index of the second subarray and the starting index of the kth subarray should be less than or equal to dist. In other words, if you divide nums into the subarrays nums[0..(i1 - 1)], nums[i1..(i2 - 1)], ..., nums[ik-1..(n - 1)], then ik-1 - i1 <= dist.
//
// Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,3,2,6,4,2], k = 3, dist = 3
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The best possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays is: [1,3], [2,6,4], and [2]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 5 - 2 = 3 which is equal to dist. The total cost is nums[0] + nums[2] + nums[5] which is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
// It can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays at a cost lower than 5.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= n <= 105
//  1 <= nums[i] <= 109
//  3 <= k <= n
//  k - 2 <= dist <= n - 2
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
//   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
