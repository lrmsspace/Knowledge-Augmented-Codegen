# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-partition-of-string/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given a string s, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.
#
# Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.
#
# Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "abacaba"
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
# It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# 	s consists of only English lowercase letters.

# - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
#   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
#   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
#   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
# - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
#   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
#   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
# - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
#   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
#   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
