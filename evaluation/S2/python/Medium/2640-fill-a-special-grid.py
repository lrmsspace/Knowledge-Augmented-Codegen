# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/fill-a-special-grid/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a non-negative integer n representing a 2n x 2n grid. You must fill the grid with integers from 0 to 22n - 1 to make it special. A grid is special if it satisfies all the following conditions:
#
#
# 	All numbers in the top-right quadrant are smaller than those in the bottom-right quadrant.
# 	All numbers in the bottom-right quadrant are smaller than those in the bottom-left quadrant.
# 	All numbers in the bottom-left quadrant are smaller than those in the top-left quadrant.
# 	Each of its quadrants is also a special grid.
#
#
# Return the special 2n x 2n grid.
#
# Note: Any 1x1 grid is special.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 0
#
# Output: [[0]]
#
# Explanation:
#
# The only number that can be placed is 0, and there is only one possible position in the grid.
#
# Constraints:
# 0 <= n <= 10

# - Gray code (number, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
#   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
#   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
#   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Divide and Conquer DP (array, number, divide-and-conquer, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: Use when a problem can be broken into smaller, independent subproblems, and their solutions combine to solve the original. Also applicable when overlapping subproblems benefit from memoization or tabulation.
#   • Idea: This approach solves problems by recursively breaking them into smaller subproblems, solving each once, and storing results in a 2D table to avoid recomputation. It typically achieves a time complexity of O(N*M) or O(N^2) depending on state definition.
#   • Invariants: The DP table entry `dp[i][j]` correctly stores the optimal solution for the subproblem defined by `i` and `j`.; All subproblems `dp[x][y]` where `x < i` or `y < j` (or based on dependency order) are already computed and correct.
#   • Tips: Clearly define the state variables for your 2D DP table.; Establish the base cases before defining recursive relations.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining state transitions or recurrence relations.; Missing or incorrect base cases leading to infinite recursion or wrong results.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
