# Problem Description:
# There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].
#
# You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
#
# Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
#
# Example:
# Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
# Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
# Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
# Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
# Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
# Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
# Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
#
# Constraints:
# n == gas.length == cost.length
# 	1 <= n <= 105
# 	0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104
# 	The input is generated such that the answer is unique.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
