# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix grid.
#
# A 0-indexed m x n difference matrix diff is created with the following procedure:
#
#
# 	Let the number of ones in the ith row be onesRowi.
# 	Let the number of ones in the jth column be onesColj.
# 	Let the number of zeros in the ith row be zerosRowi.
# 	Let the number of zeros in the jth column be zerosColj.
# 	diff[i][j] = onesRowi + onesColj - zerosRowi - zerosColj
#
#
# Return the difference matrix diff.
#
# Example:
# Input: grid = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]]
# Output: [[0,0,4],[0,0,4],[-2,-2,2]]
# Explanation:
# - diff[0][0] = onesRow0 + onesCol0 - zerosRow0 - zerosCol0 = 2 + 1 - 1 - 2 = 0 
# - diff[0][1] = onesRow0 + onesCol1 - zerosRow0 - zerosCol1 = 2 + 1 - 1 - 2 = 0 
# - diff[0][2] = onesRow0 + onesCol2 - zerosRow0 - zerosCol2 = 2 + 3 - 1 - 0 = 4 
# - diff[1][0] = onesRow1 + onesCol0 - zerosRow1 - zerosCol0 = 2 + 1 - 1 - 2 = 0 
# - diff[1][1] = onesRow1 + onesCol1 - zerosRow1 - zerosCol1 = 2 + 1 - 1 - 2 = 0 
# - diff[1][2] = onesRow1 + onesCol2 - zerosRow1 - zerosCol2 = 2 + 3 - 1 - 0 = 4 
# - diff[2][0] = onesRow2 + onesCol0 - zerosRow2 - zerosCol0 = 1 + 1 - 2 - 2 = -2
# - diff[2][1] = onesRow2 + onesCol1 - zerosRow2 - zerosCol1 = 1 + 1 - 2 - 2 = -2
# - diff[2][2] = onesRow2 + onesCol2 - zerosRow2 - zerosCol2 = 1 + 3 - 2 - 0 = 2
#
# Constraints:
# m == grid.length
# 	n == grid[i].length
# 	1 <= m, n <= 105
# 	1 <= m * n <= 105
# 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
#   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
#   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
# - 0-1 BFS (graph, array, dijkstra, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum costs without a full priority queue.
#   • Idea: A specialized Breadth-First Search variant that finds shortest paths in graphs with only 0 or 1 edge weights. It uses a deque to process 0-weight edges before 1-weight edges, achieving O(V+E) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the deque have a distance value of either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.; Nodes pushed to the front of the deque always have a distance equal to the current node's distance.
#   • Tips: Utilize a deque to maintain the order of processing nodes.; Add nodes reached via 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a standard queue instead of a deque.; Failing to initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the source.
# - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, counting, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: Use when counting non-attacking piece placements on a grid, especially when the problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems based on board properties like diagonals.
#   • Idea: This algorithm employs 2D dynamic programming to count the total number of ways to place non-attacking bishops on a chessboard. It leverages the independence of placements on black and white squares/diagonals, achieving a polynomial time complexity.
#   • Invariants: For any diagonal `i`, `D[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonal `i`.; Bishops placed on black diagonals do not attack bishops placed on white diagonals.
#   • Tips: Decompose the problem into independent subproblems for black and white squares/diagonals.; Identify the state for DP, typically `dp[diagonal_index][bishops_placed]`.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the number of squares on each diagonal.; Overlapping bishops if diagonal definitions are not precise.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
