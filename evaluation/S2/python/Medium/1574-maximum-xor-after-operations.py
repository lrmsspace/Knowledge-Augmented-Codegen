# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-after-operations/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, select any non-negative integer x and an index i, then update nums[i] to be equal to nums[i] AND (nums[i] XOR x).
#
# Note that AND is the bitwise AND operation and XOR is the bitwise XOR operation.
#
# Return the maximum possible bitwise XOR of all elements of nums after applying the operation any number of times.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [3,2,4,6]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Apply the operation with x = 4 and i = 3, num[3] = 6 AND (6 XOR 4) = 6 AND 2 = 2.
# Now, nums = [3, 2, 4, 2] and the bitwise XOR of all the elements = 3 XOR 2 XOR 4 XOR 2 = 7.
# It can be shown that 7 is the maximum possible bitwise XOR.
# Note that other operations may be used to achieve a bitwise XOR of 7.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	0 <= nums[i] <= 108

# - Bit manipulation (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: When problems involve manipulating individual bits of numbers, representing sets as bitmasks, or optimizing operations on powers of two. It is also useful for certain combinatorics and dynamic programming problems.
#   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators. This technique is often used to optimize computations, manage boolean flags efficiently, or represent subsets, typically achieving O(1) complexity for fixed-size integers.
#   • Invariants: Each bit in the mask accurately reflects the inclusion or exclusion status of its corresponding element.; Bitwise operations maintain the integrity of unaffected bits.
#   • Tips: Use (1 << k) to create a mask with the k-th bit set.; n & (n-1) clears the least significant set bit.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrect operator precedence can lead to subtle bugs.; Mixing signed and unsigned integers in bitwise operations can yield unexpected results.
# - Sqrt Tree (array, tree, recursion)
#   • When to use: When you need to perform O(1) range queries and support efficient updates (single element or range) on an array, leveraging a hierarchical decomposition.
#   • Idea: A Sqrt Tree is a data structure that supports O(1) range queries and efficient updates on an array. It recursively decomposes the array into blocks and layers, using precomputed information and bitwise operations to quickly answer queries and propagate updates.
#   • Invariants: Each element is part of exactly one block at each layer of the Sqrt Tree.; The highest differing bit between `l` and `r` identifies the specific layer for processing `q(l, r)`.
#   • Tips: Precompute highest bit for efficient layer selection.; Decompose queries into intra-block and inter-block segments.
#   • Pitfalls: Naive updates can result in O(N) complexity per update.; High memory consumption due to multiple layers of precomputed arrays.
# - Sprague-Grundy theorem. Nim (array, number, game-theory, prefix-xor)
#   • When to use: Use when analyzing impartial games with perfect information and no draws, especially to determine winning/losing states or to find a winning strategy. It's particularly useful for games that can be reduced to Nim.
#   • Idea: The Sprague-Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a Nim pile of a certain size (its nim-value or grundy number). For Nim, a position is a winning position if and only if the XOR sum of all pile sizes is non-zero, allowing for O(N) classification.
#   • Invariants: The XOR sum of the pile sizes (nim-sum) represents the game's current nim-value.; If the nim-sum is zero, any valid move will result in a non-zero nim-sum for the opponent.
#   • Tips: Understand the definition of impartial games and their properties.; Calculate the XOR sum of game components to determine the nim-sum.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing impartial games with partisan games where players have different moves.; Incorrectly calculating the XOR sum, leading to wrong state classifications.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
