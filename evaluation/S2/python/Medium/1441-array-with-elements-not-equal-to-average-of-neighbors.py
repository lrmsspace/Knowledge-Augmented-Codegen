# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/array-with-elements-not-equal-to-average-of-neighbors/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed array nums of distinct integers. You want to rearrange the elements in the array such that every element in the rearranged array is not equal to the average of its neighbors.
#
# More formally, the rearranged array should have the property such that for every i in the range 1 <= i < nums.length - 1, (nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]) / 2 is not equal to nums[i].
#
# Return any rearrangement of nums that meets the requirements.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,4,5,3]
# Explanation:
# When i=1, nums[i] = 2, and the average of its neighbors is (1+4) / 2 = 2.5.
# When i=2, nums[i] = 4, and the average of its neighbors is (2+5) / 2 = 3.5.
# When i=3, nums[i] = 5, and the average of its neighbors is (4+3) / 2 = 3.5.
#
# Constraints:
# 3 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	0 <= nums[i] <= 105

# - bucket-sort (array, bucket-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when sorting elements with a known, uniform distribution over a specific range. It is efficient for numbers that are uniformly distributed across a range, often achieving linear time complexity.
#   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates them. It can achieve O(N+K) average time complexity for uniformly distributed data.
#   • Invariants: After distributing elements, each element `x` is in bucket `floor(N * x)`.; After sorting buckets, every bucket `buckets[i]` contains its elements in sorted order.
#   • Tips: Choose the number of buckets appropriately based on data distribution and range.; Normalize input data to a [0, 1) range for simpler bucket indexing.
#   • Pitfalls: Poor performance with non-uniform data distribution, potentially degrading to O(N^2).; Requires extra space for the buckets, proportional to N+K.
# - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
#   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
#   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
#   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
# - Quicksort (array, two-pointers, randomized)
#   • When to use: Use Quicksort for efficient in-place sorting of arrays, especially when average-case performance and cache efficiency are prioritized. It is suitable for large datasets where memory usage is a concern.
#   • Idea: Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot element, then recursively sorts the two resulting subarrays. Its average time complexity is O(N log N), but can degrade to O(N^2) in the worst case.
#   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the `lt` pointer are less than the pivot value.; All elements to the right of the `gt` pointer are greater than the pivot value.
#   • Tips: Randomly shuffle the input or choose a random pivot to ensure average-case performance.; Employ 3-way partitioning to efficiently handle duplicate keys and avoid quadratic worst-case scenarios.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to handle duplicate keys can lead to quadratic time complexity.; Incorrect pointer crossing logic can cause infinite loops or array out-of-bounds errors.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
