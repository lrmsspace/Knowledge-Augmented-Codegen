# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-possible-stable-binary-arrays-i/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given 3 positive integers zero, one, and limit.
#
# A binary array arr is called stable if:
#
#
# 	The number of occurrences of 0 in arr is exactly zero.
# 	The number of occurrences of 1 in arr is exactly one.
# 	Each subarray of arr with a size greater than limit must contain both 0 and 1.
#
#
# Return the total number of stable binary arrays.
#
# Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
# Example:
# Input: zero = 1, one = 1, limit = 2
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
#
# The two possible stable binary arrays are [1,0] and [0,1], as both arrays have a single 0 and a single 1, and no subarray has a length greater than 2.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= zero, one, limit <= 200
#
# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - Factorial modulo 
# p (number, array, recursion, mod-exp, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when computing powers of numbers modulo another number, especially with very large exponents, to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.
#   • Idea: Modular exponentiation computes the remainder of a large positive integer power divided by another positive integer. It runs in O(log exponent) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The current result `res` accumulates the product of `base` terms modulo `modulus`.; The `exponent` variable always represents the remaining power to be applied.
#   • Tips: Use binary exponentiation (exponentiation by squaring) for efficiency.; Handle base, exponent, and modulus carefully for edge cases like zero or one.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to apply modulo at each step, leading to overflow.; Incorrectly handling negative exponents (if applicable, though usually positive).
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
#   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
#   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
