# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary-through-deleting/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given a string s and a string array dictionary, return the longest string in the dictionary that can be formed by deleting some of the given string characters. If there is more than one possible result, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the empty string.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "abpcplea", dictionary = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]
# Output: "apple"
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# 	1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000
# 	1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 1000
# 	s and dictionary[i] consist of lowercase English letters.

# - Suffix array (array, string, suffix-array, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use suffix arrays for efficient string processing tasks like finding all occurrences of a pattern, locating the longest common substring, or performing various substring queries. It provides a sorted index of all suffixes.
#   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing their starting indices in lexicographical order. It enables various string operations to be performed efficiently, often with O(N log N) or O(N) time complexity for construction and O(M log N) or O(M) for queries.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array A always contains N elements, where N is the length of the original string.; For any valid index i, A[i] stores a starting position within the original string S.
#   • Tips: Append a unique sentinel character (e.g., '$') to the string to ensure all suffixes are distinct.; Combine with a Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array for enhanced functionality, such as counting distinct substrings.
#   • Pitfalls: Naive construction by sorting all suffixes directly is inefficient (O(N^2 log N) or worse).; Implementing advanced construction algorithms from scratch can be complex and error-prone.
# - Tries (trie, tree, trie-match)
#   • When to use: Use when managing a collection of strings and requiring efficient prefix-based operations like search, insertion, deletion, or finding the longest common prefix.
#   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where nodes represent characters and paths from the root represent strings. Operations like insertion, search, and deletion typically take O(L) time, where L is the length of the key.
#   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node's children pointers correspond to the next character in a string.
#   • Tips: Mark nodes as 'end of word' to distinguish prefixes from complete words.; Use an array for children pointers if the alphabet size is small and fixed (e.g., ASCII).
#   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or very deep tries due to many empty child pointers.; Deletion can be complex, requiring careful handling of nodes that are part of other words.
# - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
#   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
#   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
