# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node target, and an integer k, return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node.
#
# You can return the answer in any order.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2
# Output: [7,4,1]
# Explanation: The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) have values 7, 4, and 1.
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 500].
# 	0 <= Node.val <= 500
# 	All the values Node.val are unique.
# 	target is the value of one of the nodes in the tree.
# 	0 <= k <= 1000

# - Breadth-first search (graph, queue, array, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) from a source node to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph. It is also suitable for exploring a graph layer by layer.
#   • Idea: BFS systematically explores a graph level by level, starting from a source node, ensuring all nodes at a given distance are visited before moving to the next distance level. It operates in O(N + M) time for N vertices and M edges.
#   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or adjacent distance level from the source.; The 'used' array accurately reflects all nodes that have been added to the queue for processing.
#   • Tips: Always use a queue to maintain the order of nodes to visit.; Utilize a 'visited' array or set to prevent revisiting nodes and infinite loops.
#   • Pitfalls: Does not find shortest paths in weighted graphs unless weights are 0 or 1 (use Dijkstra for general weighted graphs).; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to incorrect results or TLE.
# - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
#   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
#   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
#   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
#   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
# - Search for connected components in a graph (stack, graph, dfs, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when the goal is to identify distinct groups of interconnected nodes within a graph, or to find all nodes reachable from a specific starting point.
#   • Idea: Depth-First Search (DFS) explores a graph by traversing as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It efficiently finds connected components by visiting all reachable nodes from an unvisited starting point, typically with O(V+E) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All nodes in the current DFS path from the start node to the current node are on the recursion stack.; Any node marked as visited will not be re-processed by the current DFS call.
#   • Tips: Maintain a 'visited' status for each node to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Iterate through all nodes and start DFS if a node is unvisited to find all components.
#   • Pitfalls: Excessive recursion depth can lead to stack overflow errors for large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited results in infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
