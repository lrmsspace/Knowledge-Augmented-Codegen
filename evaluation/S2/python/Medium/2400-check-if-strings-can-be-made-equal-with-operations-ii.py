# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-strings-can-be-made-equal-with-operations-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.
#
# You can apply the following operation on any of the two strings any number of times:
#
#
# 	Choose any two indices i and j such that i < j and the difference j - i is even, then swap the two characters at those indices in the string.
#
#
# Return true if you can make the strings s1 and s2 equal, and false otherwise.
#
# Example:
# Input: s1 = "abcdba", s2 = "cabdab"
# Output: true
# Explanation: We can apply the following operations on s1:
# - Choose the indices i = 0, j = 2. The resulting string is s1 = "cbadba".
# - Choose the indices i = 2, j = 4. The resulting string is s1 = "cbbdaa".
# - Choose the indices i = 1, j = 5. The resulting string is s1 = "cabdab" = s2.
#
# Constraints:
# n == s1.length == s2.length
# 	1 <= n <= 105
# 	s1 and s2 consist only of lowercase English letters.

# - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
#   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
#   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
#   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
# - Check whether a graph is bipartite (graph, queue, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to determine if an undirected graph can be divided into two independent sets such that all edges connect vertices from different sets, or if it is two-colorable.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines if an undirected graph is bipartite by attempting to 2-color it using BFS. It assigns alternating colors (or sets) to adjacent vertices, detecting non-bipartite conditions if an edge connects two vertices of the same color.
#   • Invariants: All visited vertices within the current BFS component are correctly 2-colored.; All edges processed so far connect vertices of different colors.
#   • Tips: Use two distinct colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to represent the two sets.; Iterate through all vertices and start a new BFS from any unvisited vertex to handle disconnected components.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected graphs by ensuring all vertices are visited.; Incorrectly assigning colors, leading to false positives or negatives.
# - Check if two segments intersect (geometry, number, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use this when determining if two line segments in a 2D plane share any common points, especially when floating-point precision issues need to be avoided.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect by handling collinear and non-collinear cases separately, primarily using integer arithmetic to avoid precision errors. It typically runs in O(1) time.
#   • Invariants: If segments are collinear, their 1D projections on both axes must overlap for intersection.; If segments are not collinear, each segment's endpoints must lie on opposite sides of the line containing the other segment.
#   • Tips: Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.; Utilize cross products for efficient orientation checks.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly identify and handle collinear segments.; Introducing floating-point errors by using division for slopes.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
