#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree and two integers val and depth, add a row of nodes with value val at the given depth depth.
#
# Note that the root node is at depth 1.
#
# The adding rule is:
#
#
# 	Given the integer depth, for each not null tree node cur at the depth depth - 1, create two tree nodes with value val as cur's left subtree root and right subtree root.
# 	cur's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root.
# 	cur's original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root.
# 	If depth == 1 that means there is no depth depth - 1 at all, then create a tree node with value val as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [4,2,6,3,1,5], val = 1, depth = 2
# Output: [4,1,1,2,null,null,6,3,1,5]
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
# 	The depth of the tree is in the range [1, 104].
# 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
# 	-105 <= val <= 105
# 	1 <= depth <= the depth of tree + 1

# - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
#   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
#   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
#   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
# - Balanced Search Trees (tree, ds, recursion)
#   • When to use: When needing a self-balancing search tree that guarantees logarithmic time complexity for search and insertion operations. Useful for maintaining data in sorted order with consistent performance, especially when frequent updates are expected.
#   • Idea: A 2-3 tree is a self-balancing search tree where every node has either two children (a 2-node) or three children (a 3-node), ensuring all leaves are at the same depth. It guarantees O(log N) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
#   • Invariants: All leaves are at the same depth from the root.; Every node is either a 2-node (one key, two children) or a 3-node (two keys, three children).
#   • Tips: Understand the two node types: 2-nodes (one key, two children) and 3-nodes (two keys, three children).; Insertion always starts by finding the leaf position, then propagates splits upwards if a 4-node is formed.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the promotion of keys during node splits can break the tree's structure.; Forgetting to update parent links after a node split or merge operation.
