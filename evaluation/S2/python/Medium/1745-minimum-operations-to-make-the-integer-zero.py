# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-integer-zero/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given two integers num1 and num2.
#
# In one operation, you can choose integer i in the range [0, 60] and subtract 2i + num2 from num1.
#
# Return the integer denoting the minimum number of operations needed to make num1 equal to 0.
#
# If it is impossible to make num1 equal to 0, return -1.
#
# Example:
# Input: num1 = 3, num2 = -2
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can make 3 equal to 0 with the following operations:
# - We choose i = 2 and subtract 22 + (-2) from 3, 3 - (4 + (-2)) = 1.
# - We choose i = 2 and subtract 22 + (-2) from 1, 1 - (4 + (-2)) = -1.
# - We choose i = 0 and subtract 20 + (-2) from -1, (-1) - (1 + (-2)) = 0.
# It can be proven, that 3 is the minimum number of operations that we need to perform.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= num1 <= 109
#  -109 <= num2 <= 109

# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
#   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
# - Bit manipulation (number, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when operations on individual bits of an integer are required, for optimizing arithmetic with powers of two, or for efficient management of boolean flags.
#   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators and shifts. These operations typically have O(1) time complexity as they are hardware-level instructions.
#   • Invariants: The total number of bits representing the integer remains constant for fixed-width types.; Applying `n & (1 << k)` isolates the k-th bit, setting all other bits to zero.
#   • Tips: Use `&` with `(1 << k)` to check if the k-th bit is set.; Use `|` with `(1 << k)` to set the k-th bit.
#   • Pitfalls: Be aware of integer overflow when performing large left shifts.; Understand the difference between arithmetic and logical right shifts, especially for signed numbers.
# - The Stern-Brocot tree and Farey sequences (number, tree, binary-search, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use this when representing positive rational numbers as unique paths in a binary tree or when efficiently approximating irrational numbers. It's ideal for finding a fraction's path or its position within ordered sequences.
#   • Idea: The Stern-Brocot tree uniquely maps every positive rational number to a binary path, constructed by repeatedly taking mediants. This allows for efficient search and representation of fractions with O(log(p+q)) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The target fraction p/q always lies strictly between the current left boundary pL/qL and right boundary pR/qR.; The current left and right boundary fractions (pL/qL, pR/qR) are always adjacent terms in some Farey sequence.
#   • Tips: Initialize search boundaries with 0/1 and 1/0 (or 1/1 for positive fractions).; Calculate the mediant (pL+pR)/(qL+qR) to determine the next candidate fraction.
#   • Pitfalls: Naive O(p+q) search without run-length encoding can be too slow for large fractions.; Incorrectly handling initial boundary conditions (e.g., 0/1, 1/0, 1/1).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
