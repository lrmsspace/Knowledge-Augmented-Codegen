#
# Problem Description:
# There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.
#
# You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree. You are also given an integer array restricted which represents restricted nodes.
#
# Return the maximum number of nodes you can reach from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
#
# Note that node 0 will not be a restricted node.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,1],[4,0],[0,5],[5,6]], restricted = [4,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree.
# We have that [0,1,2,3] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= n <= 105
# 	edges.length == n - 1
# 	edges[i].length == 2
# 	0 <= ai, bi < n
# 	ai != bi
# 	edges represents a valid tree.
# 	1 <= restricted.length < n
# 	1 <= restricted[i] < n
# 	All the values of restricted are unique.

# - Breadth-first search (graph, deque, array, 01-bfs)
#   • When to use: When finding the shortest path in a graph where edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1, or when minimizing operations where some operations are 'free' (cost 0) and others have a unit cost (cost 1).
#   • Idea: A graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source to all reachable nodes in a graph where edge weights are either 0 or 1. It uses a deque to prioritize 0-cost edges, achieving an optimal O(V + E) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: Nodes are added to the front of the deque if the edge weight is 0, and to the back if 1.; The distance `dist[u]` for any node `u` in the deque is either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.
#   • Tips: Use a deque: push 0-cost edges to the front, 1-cost edges to the back.; Mark nodes visited to avoid cycles and redundant processing.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling visited states can lead to infinite loops or incorrect paths.; Forgetting to initialize distances properly before starting the traversal.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
# - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
#   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
#   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
#   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
#   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
