# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.
#
# Example:
# Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
# Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= preorder.length <= 3000
# 	inorder.length == preorder.length
# 	-3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000
# 	preorder and inorder consist of unique values.
# 	Each value of inorder also appears in preorder.
# 	preorder is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.
# 	inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.

# - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
#   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
# - Binary Search Trees
#  (tree, recursion)
#   • When to use: When you need to store ordered data that allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion while maintaining sorted order. It's suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change.
#   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(log N) average time and O(N) worst-case.
#   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than its key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than its key.
#   • Tips: Maintain the BST property: left child < parent < right child.; Recursion simplifies many operations like search, insert, and traversal.
#   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade performance to O(N) for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can break BST properties or lead to data loss.
# - Sqrt Tree (array, tree, divide-and-conquer, recursion, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: When performing associative range queries on an array, especially when O(1) query time is critical and O(N log log N) preprocessing is acceptable.
#   • Idea: The Sqrt Tree is a data structure that answers associative range queries on an array in O(1) time after O(N log log N) preprocessing. It achieves this by recursively applying sqrt decomposition, precomputing block-wise prefix/suffix operations and inter-block results.
#   • Invariants: The `prefixOp` array for any block `k` stores the associative sum from the block's start to each element within it.; The `suffixOp` array for any block `k` stores the associative sum from each element within it to the block's end.
#   • Tips: Ensure the operation is strictly associative for correctness.; Carefully handle block boundaries and partial blocks during query processing.
#   • Pitfalls: Using non-associative operations will yield incorrect results.; High memory usage for the 'between' array if not optimized or if N is very large.
