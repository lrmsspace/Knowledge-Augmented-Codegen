# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You have an array arr of length n where arr[i] = (2 * i) + 1 for all valid values of i (i.e., 0 <= i < n).
#
# In one operation, you can select two indices x and y where 0 <= x, y < n and subtract 1 from arr[x] and add 1 to arr[y] (i.e., perform arr[x] -=1 and arr[y] += 1). The goal is to make all the elements of the array equal. It is guaranteed that all the elements of the array can be made equal using some operations.
#
# Given an integer n, the length of the array, return the minimum number of operations needed to make all the elements of arr equal.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: arr = [1, 3, 5]
# First operation choose x = 2 and y = 0, this leads arr to be [2, 3, 4]
# In the second operation choose x = 2 and y = 0 again, thus arr = [3, 3, 3].
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 104

# - Fibonacci Numbers (array, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use this when calculating the n-th Fibonacci number or similar sequences where each term depends on a fixed number of preceding terms. It efficiently avoids redundant computations for moderate 'n' values.
#   • Idea: This algorithm calculates Fibonacci numbers iteratively by storing previously computed values in an array, building up to the desired n-th term. This approach achieves O(N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: dp[i] correctly stores the i-th Fibonacci number.; For i >= 2, dp[i] is computed as the sum of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2].
#   • Tips: Initialize base cases (F0, F1) correctly to start the sequence.; Use an array or two variables to store only the necessary previous terms.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the base cases can lead to wrong results.; A naive recursive solution without memoization will lead to exponential time complexity.
# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, ds, sliding-window, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when performing frequent range queries and point updates on an array, especially when a segment tree is too complex or memory-intensive, or when query types are diverse. It offers a balanced time complexity for both operations.
#   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and point updates. It achieves O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations.
#   • Invariants: Each element `arr[i]` belongs to exactly one block `block[i / block_size]`.; The summary for each block `block_summary[j]` accurately reflects the state of elements within block `j`.
#   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for balanced performance.; Precompute block summaries (e.g., sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or boundaries.; Forgetting to update the block's summary after a point update.
# - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
#   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
#   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
#   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
