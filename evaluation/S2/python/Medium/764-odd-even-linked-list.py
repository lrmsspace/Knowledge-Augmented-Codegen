# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
#
# The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
#
# Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
#
# You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.
#
# Example:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 104].
# 	-106 <= Node.val <= 106
#
# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - N/A
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
