# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotating-the-box/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an m x n matrix of characters boxGrid representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one of the following:
#
#
# 	A stone '#'
# 	A stationary obstacle '*'
# 	Empty '.'
#
#
# The box is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down until it lands on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box. Gravity does not affect the obstacles' positions, and the inertia from the box's rotation does not affect the stones' horizontal positions.
#
# It is guaranteed that each stone in boxGrid rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.
#
# Return an n x m matrix representing the box after the rotation described above.
#
# Example:
# Input: boxGrid = [["#",".","#"]]
# Output: [["."],
#          ["#"],
#          ["#"]]
#
# Constraints:
# m == boxGrid.length
# 	n == boxGrid[i].length
# 	1 <= m, n <= 500
# 	boxGrid[i][j] is either '#', '*', or '.'.

# - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
#   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
#   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
# - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
#   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
#   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
#   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
# - Strongly connected components and the condensation graph (graph, array, dfs, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use this when systematically exploring all possible configurations, paths, or subsets within a graph or array. It's ideal for finding every solution or verifying properties across all potential states.
#   • Idea: Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. When combined with enumeration, it systematically generates all possible combinations or paths, typically with exponential time complexity O(V+E) for traversal or O(N!) / O(2^N) for enumeration.
#   • Invariants: The current path/subset being built is valid up to the current depth.; All previously explored branches from the current node have been fully processed.
#   • Tips: Define clear base cases for recursion termination.; Manage state changes carefully when entering and exiting recursive calls.
#   • Pitfalls: Infinite recursion due to missing or incorrect base cases.; Redundant computations if states are not properly managed or memoized.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
