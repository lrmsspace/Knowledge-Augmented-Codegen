# Problem Description:
# Given two binary search trees root1 and root2, return a list containing all the integers from both trees sorted in ascending order.
#
# Example:
# Input: root1 = [2,1,4], root2 = [1,0,3]
# Output: [0,1,1,2,3,4]
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in each tree is in the range [0, 5000].
# 	-105 <= Node.val <= 105

# - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
#   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
# - Binary Search Trees
#  (tree, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to store ordered data in a hierarchical structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change while maintaining sorted order.
#   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node has a key, and all keys in the left subtree are less than the node's key, while all keys in the right subtree are greater. Basic operations like search, insertion, and deletion typically have an average time complexity of O(log N) but can degrade to O(N) in the worst case.
#   • Invariants: For every node N, if L is in N's left subtree, then L.key < N.key.; For every node N, if R is in N's right subtree, then R.key > N.key.
#   • Tips: Understand the recursive definition for traversal and operations.; Handle edge cases like empty tree, single node, or leaf nodes carefully.
#   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can lead to O(N) worst-case performance for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can lead to data loss or incorrect structure.
# - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
#   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
#   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
#   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
