# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words.
#
# If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.
#
# Note that the word should be built from left to right with each additional character being added to the end of a previous word.
#
# Example:
# Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
# Output: "world"
# Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= words.length <= 1000
# 	1 <= words[i].length <= 30
# 	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

# - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently represent all distinct substrings of a string, or perform various string operations like counting unique substrings, finding occurrences, or string matching in an online fashion.
#   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a powerful data structure that represents all distinct substrings of a given string in a compact form, typically as a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG). It can be constructed in linear time O(N) and space O(N) for a string of length N.
#   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end-positions in the original string.; For any state `v`, `len(v)` is the length of the longest string represented by `v`.
#   • Tips: Understand the properties of `len` (length of the longest string in a state) and `link` (suffix link to the longest proper suffix).; The construction is online, processing characters one by one from left to right.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `link` updates, especially when cloning states during construction.; Forgetting to update the `last` pointer after each character addition step.
# - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
#   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
#   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
# - Suffix array (array, string, suffix-array, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use suffix arrays for efficient string processing tasks like finding all occurrences of a pattern, locating the longest common substring, or performing various substring queries. It provides a sorted index of all suffixes.
#   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing their starting indices in lexicographical order. It enables various string operations to be performed efficiently, often with O(N log N) or O(N) time complexity for construction and O(M log N) or O(M) for queries.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array A always contains N elements, where N is the length of the original string.; For any valid index i, A[i] stores a starting position within the original string S.
#   • Tips: Append a unique sentinel character (e.g., '$') to the string to ensure all suffixes are distinct.; Combine with a Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array for enhanced functionality, such as counting distinct substrings.
#   • Pitfalls: Naive construction by sorting all suffixes directly is inefficient (O(N^2 log N) or worse).; Implementing advanced construction algorithms from scratch can be complex and error-prone.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
