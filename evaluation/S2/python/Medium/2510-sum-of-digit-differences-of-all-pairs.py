# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digit-differences-of-all-pairs/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers where all integers have the same number of digits.
#
# The digit difference between two integers is the count of different digits that are in the same position in the two integers.
#
# Return the sum of the digit differences between all pairs of integers in nums.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [13,23,12]
#
# Output: 4
#
# Explanation:
# We have the following:
# - The digit difference between 13 and 23 is 1.
# - The digit difference between 13 and 12 is 1.
# - The digit difference between 23 and 12 is 2.
# So the total sum of digit differences between all pairs of integers is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	1 <= nums[i] < 109
# 	All integers in nums have the same number of digits.

# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
#   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
#   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
# - String Hashing (string, number, hashing, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare strings, find duplicate strings, or perform fast substring searches and pattern matching in O(1) time after initial O(N) preprocessing.
#   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to a numerical value using a polynomial function, enabling O(1) comparison of strings or substrings after O(N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: prefix_hash[i] stores the polynomial hash of the substring s[0...i-1].; p_power[k] stores p^k mod m for efficient calculation.
#   • Tips: Use two different hash functions with distinct prime `p` and `m` values to minimize collision probability.; Precompute powers of `p` and prefix hashes to enable O(1) substring hash calculation.
#   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions can lead to incorrect results; always consider their possibility.; Integer overflow if modulo operations are not applied correctly at each step of calculation.
# - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: When you need to calculate the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in sequential order. It efficiently handles both convex and non-convex polygons.
#   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing the signed areas of trapezoids or triangles formed by its edges and a reference point/axis. It achieves O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The sum accumulates the signed area contribution of processed edges.; The current vertex and the next vertex define an edge of the polygon.
#   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in sequential order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; The absolute value of the final result is the polygon's area.
#   • Pitfalls: Supplying vertices in a non-sequential or arbitrary order will yield an incorrect area.; Applying the formula to self-intersecting polygons will not give the true geometric area.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
