# Problem Description:
# There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:
#
#
# 	In each step, you will choose any 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
# 	Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
# 	You will pick the next pile with the maximum number of coins.
# 	Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
# 	Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
#
#
# Given an array of integers piles where piles[i] is the number of coins in the ith pile.
#
# Return the maximum number of coins that you can have.
#
# Example:
# Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: Choose the triplet (2, 7, 8), Alice Pick the pile with 8 coins, you the pile with 7 coins and Bob the last one.
# Choose the triplet (1, 2, 4), Alice Pick the pile with 4 coins, you the pile with 2 coins and Bob the last one.
# The maximum number of coins which you can have are: 7 + 2 = 9.
# On the other hand if we choose this arrangement (1, 2, 8), (2, 4, 7) you only get 2 + 4 = 6 coins which is not optimal.
#
# Constraints:
# 3 <= piles.length <= 105
# 	piles.length % 3 == 0
# 	1 <= piles[i] <= 104

# - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: When tasks need to be processed sequentially on a single resource to optimize a cumulative metric like total completion time or weighted sum of completion times.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal sequence for processing jobs on a single machine by applying a greedy strategy, often involving sorting based on specific criteria. It typically achieves an optimal schedule in O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The list of jobs is sorted according to the chosen greedy criterion.; For any prefix of the sorted jobs, the current schedule minimizes the objective function for those jobs.
#   • Tips: Identify the correct sorting key (e.g., processing time, weight/time ratio) for the objective function.; Prove optimality using an exchange argument to justify the greedy choice.
#   • Pitfalls: Applying an incorrect sorting criterion for the specific optimization objective.; Assuming a greedy approach is always optimal without a formal proof.
# - Sprague-Grundy theorem. Nim (array, number, game-theory, prefix-xor)
#   • When to use: Use when analyzing impartial games with perfect information and no draws, especially to determine winning/losing states or to find a winning strategy. It's particularly useful for games that can be reduced to Nim.
#   • Idea: The Sprague-Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a Nim pile of a certain size (its nim-value or grundy number). For Nim, a position is a winning position if and only if the XOR sum of all pile sizes is non-zero, allowing for O(N) classification.
#   • Invariants: The XOR sum of the pile sizes (nim-sum) represents the game's current nim-value.; If the nim-sum is zero, any valid move will result in a non-zero nim-sum for the opponent.
#   • Tips: Understand the definition of impartial games and their properties.; Calculate the XOR sum of game components to determine the nim-sum.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing impartial games with partisan games where players have different moves.; Incorrectly calculating the XOR sum, leading to wrong state classifications.

# Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
#   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
#   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
#   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
