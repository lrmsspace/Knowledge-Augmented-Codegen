# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.
#
# Return the index of the peak element.
#
# Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.
#
# Example:
# Input: arr = [0,1,0]
#
# Output: 1
#
# Constraints:
# 3 <= arr.length <= 105
# 	0 <= arr[i] <= 106
# 	arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.

# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It is applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered selections from a sequence.
#   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or with a greedy approach using binary search in O(N log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or equivalent) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index `i`, `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1` found so far.
#   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains a 'tails' array where tails[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Use binary search (specifically `lower_bound` for strictly increasing) to find the correct position to update the 'tails' array.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray; elements do not need to be contiguous.; Incorrectly applying binary search (e.g., using `upper_bound` instead of `lower_bound` for strict increase).

# Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
#   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
#   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
#   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
# - Ternary Search (interval, number, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a continuous interval, where the function strictly increases then decreases, or vice versa.
#   • Idea: Ternary search is an optimization algorithm that efficiently finds the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a continuous interval. It operates in logarithmic time, O(log N), by repeatedly narrowing the search space.
#   • Invariants: The global extremum of the unimodal function is always contained within the current interval [l, r].; The function f(x) remains unimodal on the interval [l, r] throughout the search process.
#   • Tips: For floating-point functions, use a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 100-300) instead of an epsilon threshold for robustness.; The two comparison points m1 and m2 should divide the interval into three roughly equal parts for optimal convergence.
#   • Pitfalls: Applying ternary search to a non-unimodal function will not guarantee finding the global extremum.; Floating-point precision errors can lead to incorrect comparisons or infinite loops if epsilon is too small.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
