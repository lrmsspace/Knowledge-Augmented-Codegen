#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum.
#
# The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 1000].
# 	-109 <= Node.val <= 109
# 	-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
#   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
# - Tries (trie, tree, trie-match)
#   • When to use: Use when managing a collection of strings and requiring efficient prefix-based operations like search, insertion, deletion, or finding the longest common prefix.
#   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where nodes represent characters and paths from the root represent strings. Operations like insertion, search, and deletion typically take O(L) time, where L is the length of the key.
#   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node's children pointers correspond to the next character in a string.
#   • Tips: Mark nodes as 'end of word' to distinguish prefixes from complete words.; Use an array for children pointers if the alphabet size is small and fixed (e.g., ASCII).
#   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or very deep tries due to many empty child pointers.; Deletion can be complex, requiring careful handling of nodes that are part of other words.
# - Lowest Common Ancestor - Tarjan's off-line algorithm (tree, ds, dfs, union-find)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Lowest Common Ancestor for multiple pairs of nodes in a tree, and all queries are known beforehand. It's an efficient offline approach for batch processing LCA queries.
#   • Idea: Tarjan's offline LCA algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal combined with a Union-Find data structure to answer all LCA queries efficiently. It processes N nodes and Q queries in O(N + Q * alpha(N)) time, where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.
#   • Invariants: After visiting a node 'u' and all its children, 'u' is marked as visited.; For any node 'v' whose subtree has been fully processed, 'find_set(v)' returns the representative of 'v''s component.
#   • Tips: Mark nodes as visited during DFS to track processed subtrees.; Use Union-Find's union operation to merge child subtrees with their parent after processing.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited, leading to incorrect LCA identification.; Incorrectly updating the 'ancestor' array or 'find_set' logic in Union-Find.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
