#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an n x n integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from 1 to n2 in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. board[n - 1][0]) and alternating direction each row.
#
# You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:
#
#
# 	Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].
#
# 	
# 		This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.
# 	
# 	
# 	If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.
# 	The game ends when you reach the square n2.
#
#
# A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1 and n2 are not the starting points of any snake or ladder.
#
# Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per dice roll. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.
#
#
# 	For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move, your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to 4.
#
#
# Return the least number of dice rolls required to reach the square n2. If it is not possible to reach the square, return -1.
#
# Example:
# Input: board = [[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 
# In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).
# You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.
# You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.
# You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.
# You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
# This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.
#
# Constraints:
# n == board.length == board[i].length
# 	2 <= n <= 20
# 	board[i][j] is either -1 or in the range [1, n2].
# 	The squares labeled 1 and n2 are not the starting points of any snake or ladder.

# - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
#   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
#   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
#   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.
# - 0-1 BFS (graph, queue, 01-bfs, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use when finding shortest paths in a graph where edge weights are restricted to only 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum distances from a source to all reachable nodes, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
#   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds shortest paths from a single source in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It achieves this in O(V + E) time complexity by using a deque to prioritize 0-weight edges.
#   • Invariants: All nodes in the deque have a distance value less than or equal to any node not yet processed.; Nodes added to the front of the deque (0-weight edges) always have a distance equal to the node they came from.
#   • Tips: Use a deque to maintain order: 0-weight edges go to front, 1-weight edges to back.; Initialize distances to infinity and source distance to 0.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update distances for 0-weight edges before adding to deque front.; Incorrectly handling visited states, leading to TLE or incorrect paths.
# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
#   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
#   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
#   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
