# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/build-an-array-with-stack-operations/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array target and an integer n.
#
# You have an empty stack with the two following operations:
#
#
# 	"Push": pushes an integer to the top of the stack.
# 	"Pop": removes the integer on the top of the stack.
#
#
# You also have a stream of the integers in the range [1, n].
#
# Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal to target. You should follow the following rules:
#
#
# 	If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of the stack.
# 	If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.
# 	If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to target, do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.
#
#
# Return the stack operations needed to build target following the mentioned rules. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them.
#
# Example:
# Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
# Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
# Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
# Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
# Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
# Pop the integer on the top of the stack. s = [1].
# Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,3].
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= target.length <= 100
# 	1 <= n <= 100
# 	1 <= target[i] <= n
# 	target is strictly increasing.

# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
#   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
#   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
#   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
# - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: This algorithm is used to evaluate expressions given in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation) to compute their final numerical value.
#   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an expression in Reverse Polish Notation by processing elements sequentially. Numbers are pushed onto a stack, and operators pop two operands, compute, and push the result.
#   • Invariants: The stack always contains only numbers (operands or intermediate results).; For a valid RPN expression, the stack will have at least two elements when an operator is processed.
#   • Tips: Process the RPN expression from left to right, token by token.; Push numerical operands directly onto the stack.
#   • Pitfalls: Attempting to pop from an empty stack when an operator is encountered, indicating an invalid RPN expression.; Incorrect order of operands for non-commutative operations like subtraction or division.
# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It is applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered selections from a sequence.
#   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or with a greedy approach using binary search in O(N log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or equivalent) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index `i`, `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1` found so far.
#   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains a 'tails' array where tails[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Use binary search (specifically `lower_bound` for strictly increasing) to find the correct position to update the 'tails' array.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray; elements do not need to be contiguous.; Incorrectly applying binary search (e.g., using `upper_bound` instead of `lower_bound` for strict increase).
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
