# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/decrease-elements-to-make-array-zigzag/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given an array nums of integers, a move consists of choosing any element and decreasing it by 1.
#
# An array A is a zigzag array if either:
#
#
#  Every even-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. A[0] > A[1] < A[2] > A[3] < A[4] > ...
#  OR, every odd-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements, ie. A[0] < A[1] > A[2] < A[3] > A[4] < ...
#
#
# Return the minimum number of moves to transform the given array nums into a zigzag array.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We can decrease 2 to 0 or 3 to 1.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
#  1 <= nums[i] <= 1000

# - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
#   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
#   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
#   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
#   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
# - Range Minimum Query (array, bitset, bit-fenwick)
#   • When to use: When you need to efficiently query the minimum value within a range and perform point updates on an array. It's suitable for scenarios requiring logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
#   • Idea: A Fenwick tree (BIT) can be adapted to answer Range Minimum Queries and perform point updates in O(log N) time. It achieves this by storing prefix minimums in a tree-like structure, allowing efficient aggregation.
#   • Invariants: Each node `tree[i]` stores the minimum of a specific range `[i - (i & -i) + 1, i]`.; An update to `arr[idx]` correctly propagates the new minimum to all relevant `tree` nodes.
#   • Tips: Adapt standard BIT operations for minimums instead of sums.; Use `min(current_value, new_value)` for updates and queries.
#   • Pitfalls: Standard BIT operations are for sums; direct application for minimums is incorrect.; Querying a range `[L, R]` for minimum is not a simple `query(R) - query(L-1)`.
# - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
#   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
#   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
