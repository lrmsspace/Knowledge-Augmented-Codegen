#
# Problem Description:
# Let's say a positive integer is a super-palindrome if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.
#
# Given two positive integers left and right represented as strings, return the number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
#
# Example:
# Input: left = "4", right = "1000"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
# Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= left.length, right.length <= 18
# 	left and right consist of only digits.
# 	left and right cannot have leading zeros.
# 	left and right represent integers in the range [1, 1018 - 1].
# 	left is less than or equal to right.

# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
#   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
#   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
# - The Stern-Brocot tree and Farey sequences (number, tree, binary-search, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use this when representing positive rational numbers as unique paths in a binary tree or when efficiently approximating irrational numbers. It's ideal for finding a fraction's path or its position within ordered sequences.
#   • Idea: The Stern-Brocot tree uniquely maps every positive rational number to a binary path, constructed by repeatedly taking mediants. This allows for efficient search and representation of fractions with O(log(p+q)) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The target fraction p/q always lies strictly between the current left boundary pL/qL and right boundary pR/qR.; The current left and right boundary fractions (pL/qL, pR/qR) are always adjacent terms in some Farey sequence.
#   • Tips: Initialize search boundaries with 0/1 and 1/0 (or 1/1 for positive fractions).; Calculate the mediant (pL+pR)/(qL+qR) to determine the next candidate fraction.
#   • Pitfalls: Naive O(p+q) search without run-length encoding can be too slow for large fractions.; Incorrectly handling initial boundary conditions (e.g., 0/1, 1/0, 1/1).
# - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find all palindromic substrings within a given string, or determine the longest palindromic substring, in optimal linear time.
#   • Idea: Manacher's Algorithm efficiently finds the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at each position in a given string, handling both odd and even lengths uniformly via preprocessing. It achieves this in optimal O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: p[i] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at i in the transformed string.; The right_boundary always marks the rightmost extent of the largest palindrome found so far.
#   • Tips: Preprocess the string with a unique delimiter to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage the mirror property around the current center to initialize palindrome radii.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when converting `p` array values back to original string indices or lengths.; Incorrectly handling the boundaries of the preprocessed string.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
