# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-total-strength-of-wizards/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# As the ruler of a kingdom, you have an army of wizards at your command.
#
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array strength, where strength[i] denotes the strength of the ith wizard. For a contiguous group of wizards (i.e. the wizards' strengths form a subarray of strength), the total strength is defined as the product of the following two values:
#
#
# 	The strength of the weakest wizard in the group.
# 	The total of all the individual strengths of the wizards in the group.
#
#
# Return the sum of the total strengths of all contiguous groups of wizards. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
# A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
#
# Example:
# Input: strength = [1,3,1,2]
# Output: 44
# Explanation: The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards:
# - [1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1
# - [3] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([3]) * sum([3]) = 3 * 3 = 9
# - [1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1
# - [2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([2]) * sum([2]) = 2 * 2 = 4
# - [1,3] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3]) * sum([1,3]) = 1 * 4 = 4
# - [3,1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([3,1]) * sum([3,1]) = 1 * 4 = 4
# - [1,2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,2]) * sum([1,2]) = 1 * 3 = 3
# - [1,3,1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3,1]) * sum([1,3,1]) = 1 * 5 = 5
# - [3,1,2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([3,1,2]) * sum([3,1,2]) = 1 * 6 = 6
# - [1,3,1,2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3,1,2]) * sum([1,3,1,2]) = 1 * 7 = 7
# The sum of all the total strengths is 1 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 44.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= strength.length <= 105
# 	1 <= strength[i] <= 109

# - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, prefix-sum, mod-exp)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to compute modular inverses for multiple numbers in an array or a range, especially when efficiency is critical, by leveraging prefix and suffix products to reduce inverse computations.
#   • Idea: This technique efficiently computes modular inverses for multiple numbers by transforming individual inverse calculations into a product of prefix, suffix, and a single overall inverse. It achieves O(N + log M) complexity for an array or O(M) for a range.
#   • Invariants: For 0 <= i < N, prefix_products[i] holds (arr[0] * ... * arr[i-1]) % m.; For 0 <= i < N, suffix_products[i] holds (arr[i+1] * ... * arr[N-1]) % m.
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix products and suffix products of the array elements modulo m.; Calculate the modular inverse of the total product of all elements once using modular exponentiation.
#   • Pitfalls: Ensure all numbers for which an inverse is sought are coprime to the modulus m.; Watch for off-by-one errors when calculating prefix and suffix product indices.
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
#   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
#   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
#   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
# - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, difference-array)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It provides logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
#   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that can efficiently update individual elements and calculate prefix sums in an array. Both operations are performed in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: Each `tree[i]` element stores the sum of a contiguous range of elements from the original array, specifically from `i - (i & -i) + 1` to `i` (inclusive, 1-based).; After any `update(idx, val)` operation, `query(idx)` will reflect the new sum up to `idx`.
#   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for array elements to simplify bitwise logic; The `idx & -idx` operation is key to navigating the implicit tree structure
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-based and 1-based indexing can lead to incorrect results; Off-by-one errors when calculating range sums (e.g., `query(R) - query(L-1)`)
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
