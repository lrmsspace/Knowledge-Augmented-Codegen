# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/erect-the-fence/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an array trees where trees[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of a tree in the garden.
#
# Fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope, as it is expensive. The garden is well-fenced only if all the trees are enclosed.
#
# Return the coordinates of trees that are exactly located on the fence perimeter. You may return the answer in any order.
#
# Example:
# Input: trees = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]
# Output: [[1,1],[2,0],[4,2],[3,3],[2,4]]
# Explanation: All the trees will be on the perimeter of the fence except the tree at [2, 2], which will be inside the fence.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= trees.length <= 3000
# 	trees[i].length == 2
# 	0 <= xi, yi <= 100
# 	All the given positions are unique.

# - Convex Hull construction (geometry, array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a plane. It is fundamental for various geometric algorithms and optimization problems.
#   • Idea: Convex hull construction identifies the subset of points that form the vertices of the smallest convex polygon containing all given points. Common algorithms achieve this in O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The sequence of points currently forming the hull maintains a convex property.; All points considered up to the current iteration are either part of the hull or lie within the polygon defined by the hull.
#   • Tips: Sort points by X-coordinate (and Y for ties) as a common preprocessing step.; Consider algorithms like Graham Scan or Monotone Chain for efficiency.
#   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect orientation calculations.; Incorrectly handling collinear points can result in non-minimal hulls or errors.
# - Manhattan Distance (geometry, graph, sweep-line, mst-kruskal, coordinate-compress)
#   • When to use: Use this when finding the Minimum Spanning Tree for points in a 2D plane where edge weights are Manhattan distances, or when a geometric problem can be simplified by transforming Manhattan to Chebyshev distance.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Tree for points in a 2D plane using Manhattan distance. It leverages a sweep-line approach to efficiently find nearest neighbors in specific octants, reducing the number of candidate edges for Kruskal's algorithm, achieving O(N log N) complexity.
#   • Invariants: For any point 's' in the active set, its nearest neighbor in the current octant has not yet been processed.; Points are processed in non-decreasing order of 'x + y' (or transformed coordinate), ensuring local optimality for distances.
#   • Tips: Consider transforming Manhattan distance problems into Chebyshev distance problems using (x+y, y-x) coordinates.; Divide the plane into 8 octants around each point to simplify nearest neighbor searches.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining or handling the 8 octants, especially near boundaries or for points with equal coordinates.; Inefficiently managing the 'active set' during the sweep-line, leading to higher than O(N log N) complexity.
# - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
#   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
#   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
