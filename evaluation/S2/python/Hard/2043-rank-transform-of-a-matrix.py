# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-transform-of-a-matrix/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# Given an m x n matrix, return a new matrix answer where answer[row][col] is the rank of matrix[row][col].
#
# The rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules:
#
#
# 	The rank is an integer starting from 1.
# 	If two elements p and q are in the same row or column, then:
# 	
# 		If p < q then rank(p) < rank(q)
# 		If p == q then rank(p) == rank(q)
# 		If p > q then rank(p) > rank(q)
# 	
# 	
# 	The rank should be as small as possible.
#
#
# The test cases are generated so that answer is unique under the given rules.
#
# Example:
# Input: matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]
# Output: [[1,2],[2,3]]
# Explanation:
# The rank of matrix[0][0] is 1 because it is the smallest integer in its row and column.
# The rank of matrix[0][1] is 2 because matrix[0][1] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.
# The rank of matrix[1][0] is 2 because matrix[1][0] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.
# The rank of matrix[1][1] is 3 because matrix[1][1] > matrix[0][1], matrix[1][1] > matrix[1][0], and both matrix[0][1] and matrix[1][0] are rank 2.
#
# Constraints:
# m == matrix.length
# 	n == matrix[i].length
# 	1 <= m, n <= 500
# 	-109 <= matrix[row][col] <= 109

# - Finding the rank of a matrix (matrix, simulation, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to determine the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix. It's also applicable for understanding the dimension of the vector space spanned by the matrix's rows or columns.
#   • Idea: Determines the rank of a matrix by transforming it into row echelon form using Gaussian elimination. The rank is the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form, with a time complexity of O(N^3).
#   • Invariants: The number of non-zero rows processed so far equals the current rank.; All elements below the pivot in the current column are zeroed out.
#   • Tips: Always choose the largest absolute value pivot for numerical stability.; Swap rows to bring a non-zero element to the pivot position.
#   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect zero checks.; Forgetting to increment rank only when a valid pivot is found.
# - Range Minimum Query (array, ds, union-find)
#   • When to use: Use when range minimum queries are needed on an array where elements can be dynamically removed or merged, and Union-Find is employed to manage the active state or connectivity of indices.
#   • Idea: Union-Find can be adapted to assist in range minimum queries, particularly when elements are dynamically removed or merged. It helps maintain connectivity of active elements or segments, allowing efficient traversal to find the minimum among available items, often with near-constant amortized time per Union-Find operation.
#   • Invariants: The `find` operation correctly returns the canonical representative for any element `i`.; Each set in the Union-Find structure maintains a property (e.g., minimum value, next available index) relevant to its merged elements.
#   • Tips: Utilize path compression and union by rank/size for optimal Union-Find performance.; Store relevant properties (e.g., minimum value, next available index) within the representative of each set.
#   • Pitfalls: Union-Find alone does not directly provide range minimums; it typically manages connectivity or availability.; Naive iteration through active elements found by Union-Find can be too slow for large ranges.
# - Hungarian algorithm for solving the assignment problem (matrix, graph, greedy, bfs)
#   • When to use: Finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs or uniform-cost state-space searches. Explores states layer by layer.
#   • Idea: Explores all reachable nodes in a graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. It operates in O(V + E) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same distance from the source.; All nodes visited so far have their shortest distance from the source determined.
#   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit.; Mark nodes as visited to prevent cycles and redundant processing.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops.; Incorrectly handling disconnected components.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
