# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-subsequence/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an array target that consists of distinct integers and another integer array arr that can have duplicates.
#
# In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in arr. For example, if arr = [1,4,1,2], you can add 3 in the middle and make it [1,4,3,1,2]. Note that you can insert the integer at the very beginning or end of the array.
#
# Return the minimum number of operations needed to make target a subsequence of arr.
#
# A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, [2,7,4] is a subsequence of [4,2,3,7,2,1,4] (the underlined elements), while [2,4,2] is not.
#
# Example:
# Input: target = [5,1,3], arr = [9,4,2,3,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You can add 5 and 1 in such a way that makes arr = [5,9,4,1,2,3,4], then target will be a subsequence of arr.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= target.length, arr.length <= 105
# 	1 <= target[i], arr[i] <= 109
# 	target contains no duplicates.

# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
#   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
#   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
# - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (tree, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently find the MEX of a sequence after multiple point updates, where the sequence elements are non-negative integers.
#   • Idea: This approach uses a segment tree or similar data structure to maintain counts of elements, allowing efficient O(log N) updates and O(log N) queries for the minimal excluded number (MEX). The core idea is to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sequence.
#   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree correctly stores the count of distinct numbers within its represented range.; The MEX query always explores the leftmost child first if its range is not 'full' (i.e., missing elements).
#   • Tips: Build the tree over the range of possible non-negative integer values, typically up to N or a maximum constraint.; Each tree node should store the count of distinct numbers present within its represented range.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle numbers larger than the maximum range covered by the segment tree.; Incorrectly updating counts for elements, leading to stale or erroneous MEX values.
# - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
#   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
#   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
#   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
