# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given k identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n.
#
# You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.
#
# Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.
#
# Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
#
# Example:
# Input: k = 1, n = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.
# Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know that f = 1.
# If it does not break, then we know f = 2.
# Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= k <= 100
# 	1 <= n <= 104

# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
#   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.

# Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
#   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
#   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
#   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
# - Josephus Problem (number, dp-1d, recursion)
#   • When to use: Used to determine the position of the last remaining person in a circle where every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains. It models sequential removal processes in a circular arrangement.
#   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the position of the survivor in a circle of N people, where every K-th person is eliminated. The standard solution uses a recursive relation or dynamic programming, typically achieving O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The result J(n, k) represents the survivor's original 0-indexed position among n people.; Each recursive step J(n, k) correctly transforms the result from J(n-1, k) based on the k-th elimination.
#   • Tips: Use 0-indexing for a simpler and more elegant recursive formula.; Establish the base case for N=1 (the survivor is always 0 or 1).
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when switching between 0-indexing and 1-indexing.; Incorrectly applying the modulo operator, especially with negative results in some languages.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
