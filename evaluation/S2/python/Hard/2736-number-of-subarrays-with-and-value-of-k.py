#
# Problem Description:
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of subarrays of nums where the bitwise AND of the elements of the subarray equals k.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 1
#
# Output: 6
#
# Explanation:
#
# All subarrays contain only 1's.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	0 <= nums[i], k <= 109
#
# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, difference-array)
#   • When to use: Use when an array requires frequent point updates and efficient retrieval of prefix sums or range sums. It offers logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
#   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that efficiently supports point updates and prefix sum queries on an array in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: Each `bit[i]` stores the sum of a contiguous range of elements from the original array.; The range length represented by `bit[i]` is determined by `i & -i` (the least significant bit).
#   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for simpler bitwise operations (`i & -i`).; Initialize with an existing array in O(N) time using a linear construction method.
#   • Pitfalls: Directly finding range minimum/maximum is not efficient or generally supported.; Operations must be associative and preferably invertible for general range queries.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
# - Submask Enumeration
#  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
#   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
#   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
#   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
