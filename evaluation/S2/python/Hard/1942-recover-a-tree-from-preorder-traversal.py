# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-a-tree-from-preorder-traversal/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# We run a preorder depth-first search (DFS) on the root of a binary tree.
#
# At each node in this traversal, we output D dashes (where D is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  If the depth of a node is D, the depth of its immediate child is D + 1.  The depth of the root node is 0.
#
# If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.
#
# Given the output traversal of this traversal, recover the tree and return its root.
#
# Example:
# Input: traversal = "1-2--3--4-5--6--7"
# Output: [1,2,5,3,4,6,7]
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the original tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# 	1 <= Node.val <= 109

# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to uniquely encode or decode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers, or to count the number of spanning trees for a complete graph. It's also useful for problems involving tree properties like degree sequences.
#   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence representing a labeled tree, allowing conversion between a tree and a sequence of numbers. Its generation and decoding typically involve an iterative process of finding and removing leaves, achieving O(N log N) or O(N) complexity with optimized leaf finding.
#   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always has N-2 elements for an N-vertex tree.; Each vertex's degree is correctly maintained throughout the process.
#   • Tips: Maintain a degree array to efficiently find leaves.; Use a min-priority queue or a two-pointer approach for finding the smallest leaf.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in sequence length or vertex indexing.; Incorrectly handling the last two vertices during decoding.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
#   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
# - Segment Tree (tree, array, segment-tree, recursion, divide-and-conquer)
#   • When to use: Use for efficient range queries and updates on an array. It handles aggregated information over dynamic intervals.
#   • Idea: A segment tree is a tree data structure used for storing information about intervals or segments. It allows answering range queries and range updates in logarithmic time, making it efficient for dynamic array problems.
#   • Invariants: Each node represents a contiguous segment of the original array.; The value stored in a parent node is an aggregation of its children's values.
#   • Tips: Build the tree recursively, dividing the array into halves.; Each node stores an aggregate value for its corresponding segment.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling array indexing (0-based vs 1-based).; Off-by-one errors in segment boundaries during queries/updates.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
