# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-any-element-has-prime-frequency/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array nums.
#
# Return true if the frequency of any element of the array is prime, otherwise, return false.
#
# The frequency of an element x is the number of times it occurs in the array.
#
# A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 with only two factors, 1 and itself.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,4]
#
# Output: true
#
# Explanation:
#
# 4 has a frequency of two, which is a prime number.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 100
# 	0 <= nums[i] <= 100

# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, sieve, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit or precompute primality for a range. It is efficient for generating primes within a reasonable upper bound.
#   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer by iteratively marking multiples of primes as composite. It achieves a time complexity of O(N log log N).
#   • Invariants: All numbers less than the current prime 'p' have already been processed.; If 'i' is marked as prime, then all its multiples less than 'i*i' have been marked composite by smaller primes.
#   • Tips: Optimize by starting inner loop from p*p, as smaller multiples would have been marked.; Use a boolean array for primality, or an integer array to store smallest prime factor (SPF).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0 and 1, which are neither prime nor composite.; Off-by-one errors when setting array bounds or loop conditions.
# - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
#   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
#   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
# - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
#   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
#   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
#   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
