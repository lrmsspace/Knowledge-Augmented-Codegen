#
# Problem Description:
# Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that are a substring of another word. You can return the answer in any order.
#
# Example:
# Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
# Output: ["as","hero"]
# Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
# ["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= words.length <= 100
# 	1 <= words[i].length <= 30
# 	words[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
# 	All the strings of words are unique.

# - Substring Search (string, array, kmp, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern within a larger text, especially when the pattern might have repeating or overlapping prefixes.
#   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that avoids re-scanning characters in the text by pre-processing the pattern to build a 'longest proper prefix suffix' (LPS) array. It achieves optimal O(N + M) time complexity, where N is the text length and M is the pattern length.
#   • Invariants: The `j` pointer always indicates the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `text[0...i-1]`.; The `lps[j]` value stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...j-1]`.
#   • Tips: Pre-compute the LPS array (also known as failure function or border array) for the pattern.; The LPS array helps determine the next best match position after a mismatch, avoiding redundant comparisons.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the LPS array can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors when indexing the pattern or text are common.
# - Suffix array (array, string, suffix-array, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently perform various string operations like pattern searching, finding repeated substrings, or comparing suffixes lexicographically on a given text. It is a fundamental data structure for advanced string algorithms.
#   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string. It allows for efficient string operations, with construction typically achievable in O(N log N) or O(N) time for advanced algorithms.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array SA[i] stores the starting index of the i-th lexicographically smallest suffix.; All suffixes of the input string are present exactly once in the suffix array.
#   • Tips: Consider using SA-IS for optimal O(N) construction time and space complexity.; Pair the suffix array with an LCP array for enhanced functionality, such as finding longest common substrings.
#   • Pitfalls: Naive O(N^2 log N) construction is too slow for large input strings.; Implementing linear-time algorithms like SA-IS or DC3 can be complex and error-prone.
# - Aho-Corasick algorithm (trie, graph, bfs, trie-match)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns within a larger text. It is ideal for scenarios requiring simultaneous searching for multiple dictionary words.
#   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a set of patterns, allowing linear time searching for all pattern occurrences in a text. It extends a trie with suffix links and failure transitions for efficient traversal, achieving O(N + M + K) complexity where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
#   • Invariants: All nodes at depth 'd' have their suffix links correctly computed before processing nodes at depth 'd+1'.; For any node 'u', its suffix link points to the longest proper suffix of the string represented by 'u' that is also a prefix of some pattern.
#   • Tips: Build the trie from all patterns first, marking nodes that represent the end of a pattern.; Compute suffix links using a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the root.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly computing suffix links can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; High memory usage can occur for large alphabets or a vast number of patterns.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
