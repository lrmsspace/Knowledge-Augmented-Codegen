# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed array of strings details. Each element of details provides information about a given passenger compressed into a string of length 15. The system is such that:
#
#
# 	The first ten characters consist of the phone number of passengers.
# 	The next character denotes the gender of the person.
# 	The following two characters are used to indicate the age of the person.
# 	The last two characters determine the seat allotted to that person.
#
#
# Return the number of passengers who are strictly more than 60 years old.
#
# Example:
# Input: details = ["7868190130M7522","5303914400F9211","9273338290F4010"]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The passengers at indices 0, 1, and 2 have ages 75, 92, and 40. Thus, there are 2 people who are over 60 years old.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= details.length <= 100
# 	details[i].length == 15
# 	details[i] consists of digits from '0' to '9'.
# 	details[i][10] is either 'M' or 'F' or 'O'.
# 	The phone numbers and seat numbers of the passengers are distinct.

# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
#   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
#   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is particularly efficient when optimizing the O(N^2) dynamic programming solution to O(N log N) using binary search.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines the longest subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search.
#   • Invariants: The 'tails' array always stores the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The 'tails' array is always sorted in strictly increasing order.
#   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array 'tails' where 'tails[i]' is the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.; Utilize binary search (e.g., `std::lower_bound`) to find the correct position for the current element in the 'tails' array.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing a subsequence with a contiguous subarray, which is a common mistake.; Incorrectly updating the 'tails' array, leading to non-increasing subsequences or incorrect lengths.
# - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
#   • When to use: Use this when verifying if a sequence of delimiters is correctly nested and balanced. It is also applicable for counting or generating all possible valid sequences of a given length.
#   • Idea: This algorithm involves checking if a sequence of opening and closing delimiters is properly matched and nested, or enumerating such sequences. Validation typically uses a stack in O(N) time, while generation often involves backtracking with O(Catalan(N)) complexity.
#   • Invariants: The stack contains only opening delimiters that are yet to be matched.; The balance counter (open - close) is never negative at any point during traversal.
#   • Tips: Use a stack to track unmatched opening delimiters for validation.; Maintain a balance counter (increment for open, decrement for close) for a simpler check.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if the stack is empty after processing the entire sequence.; Allowing a closing delimiter when no matching opening delimiter is available (empty stack or mismatch).
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
