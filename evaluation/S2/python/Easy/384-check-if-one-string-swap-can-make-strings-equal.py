# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.
#
# Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return false.
#
# Example:
# Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
# Output: true
# Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
# 	s1.length == s2.length
# 	s1 and s2 consist of only lowercase English letters.

# - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
#   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
#   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
#   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
# - Check if two segments intersect (geometry, number, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use this when determining if two line segments in a 2D plane share any common points, especially when floating-point precision issues need to be avoided.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect by handling collinear and non-collinear cases separately, primarily using integer arithmetic to avoid precision errors. It typically runs in O(1) time.
#   • Invariants: If segments are collinear, their 1D projections on both axes must overlap for intersection.; If segments are not collinear, each segment's endpoints must lie on opposite sides of the line containing the other segment.
#   • Tips: Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.; Utilize cross products for efficient orientation checks.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly identify and handle collinear segments.; Introducing floating-point errors by using division for slopes.
# - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
#   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
#   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
#   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
