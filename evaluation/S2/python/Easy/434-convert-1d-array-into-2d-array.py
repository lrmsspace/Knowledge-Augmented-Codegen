# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-1d-array-into-2d-array/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with  m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.
#
# The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.
#
# Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.
#
# Example:
# Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
# Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
# Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
# The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
# The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= original.length <= 5 * 104
# 	1 <= original[i] <= 105
# 	1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104

# - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when division operations are required in modular arithmetic, especially for combinatorics or probability problems under a modulus. It's crucial for precomputing inverses efficiently for a range of numbers.
#   • Idea: Calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number 'a' modulo 'm', which is an integer 'x' such that (a * x) % m == 1. When precomputing inverses for a range [1, N], a linear time O(N) dynamic programming approach can be used.
#   • Invariants: For all k in [1, i-1], inv[k] correctly stores k^(-1) % m.; inv[i] is computed using previously calculated inv[m % i].
#   • Tips: For prime modulus 'm', a^(m-2) % m (Fermat's Little Theorem) is efficient for a single inverse.; The Extended Euclidean Algorithm works for any 'm' if gcd(a, m) = 1.
#   • Pitfalls: A modular inverse only exists if gcd(a, m) == 1.; Fermat's Little Theorem is only applicable when the modulus 'm' is prime.
# - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
#   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
#   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
# - bucket-sort (array, bucket-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when sorting elements with a known, uniform distribution over a specific range. It is efficient for numbers that are uniformly distributed across a range, often achieving linear time complexity.
#   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates them. It can achieve O(N+K) average time complexity for uniformly distributed data.
#   • Invariants: After distributing elements, each element `x` is in bucket `floor(N * x)`.; After sorting buckets, every bucket `buckets[i]` contains its elements in sorted order.
#   • Tips: Choose the number of buckets appropriately based on data distribution and range.; Normalize input data to a [0, 1) range for simpler bucket indexing.
#   • Pitfalls: Poor performance with non-uniform data distribution, potentially degrading to O(N^2).; Requires extra space for the buckets, proportional to N+K.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
