// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/split-the-array-to-make-coprime-products/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.
//
// A split at an index i where 0 <= i <= n - 2 is called valid if the product of the first i + 1 elements and the product of the remaining elements are coprime.
//
//
// 	For example, if nums = [2, 3, 3], then a split at the index i = 0 is valid because 2 and 9 are coprime, while a split at the index i = 1 is not valid because 6 and 3 are not coprime. A split at the index i = 2 is not valid because i == n - 1.
//
//
// Return the smallest index i at which the array can be split validly or -1 if there is no such split.
//
// Two values val1 and val2 are coprime if gcd(val1, val2) == 1 where gcd(val1, val2) is the greatest common divisor of val1 and val2.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [4,7,8,15,3,5]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The table above shows the values of the product of the first i + 1 elements, the remaining elements, and their gcd at each index i.
// The only valid split is at index 2.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	1 <= n <= 104
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 106

// - Euler's totient function
//  (array, number, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. It is also useful for problems involving modular arithmetic, group theory, and cryptographic applications.
//   • Idea: Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. It can be computed using prime factorization in O(sqrt(N)) or for a range using a sieve in O(N log log N).
//   • Invariants: For a sieve, phi[i] correctly stores the totient value for i after processing all its prime factors.; When factorizing n, n is continuously reduced by its smallest prime factor until it becomes 1.
//   • Tips: For a single n, find its prime factors and apply the product formula.; For computing φ(n) for all n up to a limit, use a sieve similar to Sieve of Eratosthenes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling repeated prime factors in the formula.; Integer overflow when calculating products for very large n.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, prefix-sum, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compute modular inverses for multiple numbers in an array or a range, especially when efficiency is critical, by leveraging prefix and suffix products to reduce inverse computations.
//   • Idea: This technique efficiently computes modular inverses for multiple numbers by transforming individual inverse calculations into a product of prefix, suffix, and a single overall inverse. It achieves O(N + log M) complexity for an array or O(M) for a range.
//   • Invariants: For 0 <= i < N, prefix_products[i] holds (arr[0] * ... * arr[i-1]) % m.; For 0 <= i < N, suffix_products[i] holds (arr[i+1] * ... * arr[N-1]) % m.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix products and suffix products of the array elements modulo m.; Calculate the modular inverse of the total product of all elements once using modular exponentiation.
//   • Pitfalls: Ensure all numbers for which an inverse is sought are coprime to the modulus m.; Watch for off-by-one errors when calculating prefix and suffix product indices.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
