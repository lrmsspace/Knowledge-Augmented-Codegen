// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/split-message-based-on-limit/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string, message, and a positive integer, limit.
//
// You must split message into one or more parts based on limit. Each resulting part should have the suffix "<a/b>", where "b" is to be replaced with the total number of parts and "a" is to be replaced with the index of the part, starting from 1 and going up to b. Additionally, the length of each resulting part (including its suffix) should be equal to limit, except for the last part whose length can be at most limit.
//
// The resulting parts should be formed such that when their suffixes are removed and they are all concatenated in order, they should be equal to message. Also, the result should contain as few parts as possible.
//
// Return the parts message would be split into as an array of strings. If it is impossible to split message as required, return an empty array.
//
// Example:
// Input: message = "this is really a very awesome message", limit = 9
// Output: ["thi<1/14>","s i<2/14>","s r<3/14>","eal<4/14>","ly <5/14>","a v<6/14>","ery<7/14>"," aw<8/14>","eso<9/14>","me<10/14>"," m<11/14>","es<12/14>","sa<13/14>","ge<14/14>"]
// Explanation:
// The first 9 parts take 3 characters each from the beginning of message.
// The next 5 parts take 2 characters each to finish splitting message. 
// In this example, each part, including the last, has length 9. 
// It can be shown it is not possible to split message into less than 14 parts.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= message.length <= 104
// 	message consists only of lowercase English letters and ' '.
// 	1 <= limit <= 104
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
// - bucket-sort (array, bucket-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting elements with a known, uniform distribution over a specific range. It is efficient for numbers that are uniformly distributed across a range, often achieving linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates them. It can achieve O(N+K) average time complexity for uniformly distributed data.
//   • Invariants: After distributing elements, each element `x` is in bucket `floor(N * x)`.; After sorting buckets, every bucket `buckets[i]` contains its elements in sorted order.
//   • Tips: Choose the number of buckets appropriately based on data distribution and range.; Normalize input data to a [0, 1) range for simpler bucket indexing.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor performance with non-uniform data distribution, potentially degrading to O(N^2).; Requires extra space for the buckets, proportional to N+K.
// - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Used for efficient string searching and pattern matching in linear time. It's also fundamental for various string algorithms that leverage self-matching properties.
//   • Idea: The prefix function computes for each position in a string the length of the longest proper prefix of its substring that is also a suffix of that substring. This forms the core of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm, enabling linear time O(N) string matching.
//   • Invariants: For each i, pi[i] is the length of the longest proper prefix of s[0...i] that is also a suffix of s[0...i].; The current j (length of the matched prefix) always represents pi[i-1] or a shorter valid prefix length.
//   • Tips: The prefix function array (pi array) stores lengths, not indices.; It can be used to build the KMP automaton for pattern matching.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing proper prefix/suffix with non-proper ones.; Incorrectly handling the base case pi[0] = 0.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
