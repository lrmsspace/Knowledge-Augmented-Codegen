//
// Problem Description:
// Alice is a caretaker of n gardens and she wants to plant flowers to maximize the total beauty of all her gardens.
//
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array flowers of size n, where flowers[i] is the number of flowers already planted in the ith garden. Flowers that are already planted cannot be removed. You are then given another integer newFlowers, which is the maximum number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers target, full, and partial.
//
// A garden is considered complete if it has at least target flowers. The total beauty of the gardens is then determined as the sum of the following:
//
//
// 	The number of complete gardens multiplied by full.
// 	The minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by partial. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be 0.
//
//
// Return the maximum total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most newFlowers flowers.
//
// Example:
// Input: flowers = [1,3,1,1], newFlowers = 7, target = 6, full = 12, partial = 1
// Output: 14
// Explanation: Alice can plant
// - 2 flowers in the 0th garden
// - 3 flowers in the 1st garden
// - 1 flower in the 2nd garden
// - 1 flower in the 3rd garden
// The gardens will then be [3,6,2,2]. She planted a total of 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 7 flowers.
// There is 1 garden that is complete.
// The minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 2.
// Thus, the total beauty is 1 * 12 + 2 * 1 = 12 + 2 = 14.
// No other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 14.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= flowers.length <= 105
// 	1 <= flowers[i], target <= 105
// 	1 <= newFlowers <= 1010
// 	1 <= full, partial <= 105

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
// - Flows with demands (graph, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem involves finding a flow in a network where edges have both lower and upper capacity bounds, or nodes have supply/demand requirements, and an optimal value needs to be found.
//   • Idea: This technique transforms a network with lower and upper capacity bounds on edges (or node demands) into a standard max-flow problem. It often involves adding a new source and sink to handle demands, and then binary searching on the answer if an optimal value is sought, typically with O(MaxFlow * log(Range)) complexity.
//   • Invariants: The total flow out of the super source equals the total demand that needs to be satisfied.; For any node, the sum of incoming flow minus outgoing flow equals its net demand (0 for internal nodes in a circulation).
//   • Tips: Convert lower bounds to demands by adjusting capacities and adding a super source/sink.; A feasible flow exists if the max flow in the transformed network equals the total demand.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating residual capacities after demand satisfaction.; Forgetting to add a super source/sink for handling demands.
// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (array, heap, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when given a set of tasks with deadlines and durations, and the objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks without interruption.
//   • Idea: This greedy algorithm aims to maximize the number of jobs completed by prioritizing tasks that finish earliest. It typically involves sorting and using a min-heap, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed up to the current point have been considered for scheduling.; The set of jobs in the heap represents the jobs currently scheduled to meet their deadlines.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by their deadlines in ascending order.; Maintain a min-heap of durations for jobs currently scheduled.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing job count maximization with total duration or profit.; Failing to update the current time correctly after scheduling a job.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
