// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-arrays-with-k-matching-adjacent-elements/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given three integers n, m, k. A good array arr of size n is defined as follows:
//
//
// 	Each element in arr is in the inclusive range [1, m].
// 	Exactly k indices i (where 1 <= i < n) satisfy the condition arr[i - 1] == arr[i].
//
//
// Return the number of good arrays that can be formed.
//
// Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, m = 2, k = 1
//
// Output: 4
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	There are 4 good arrays. They are [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1] and [2, 2, 1].
// 	Hence, the answer is 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= m <= 105
// 	0 <= k <= n - 1
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Binomial Coefficients (array, number, mod-exp, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating combinations (n choose k) efficiently, especially for large n, and when results are required modulo a prime or prime power.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes binomial coefficients C(n, k) modulo a given prime m or prime power p^b. It leverages precomputed factorials and their modular inverses to achieve O(1) query time after O(MAXN) or O(MAXN log m) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: Factorials `fact[i]` are correctly computed as `i! % m`.; Modular inverse factorials `invFact[i]` satisfy `(fact[i] * invFact[i]) % m == 1`.
//   • Tips: Precompute factorials modulo m up to MAXN.; Precompute modular inverses of factorials for O(1) query time.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to take modulo at each multiplication step during factorial precomputation.; Using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverse when the modulus is not prime.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
// - Josephus Problem (number, dp-1d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used to determine the position of the last remaining person in a circle where every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains. It models sequential removal processes in a circular arrangement.
//   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the position of the survivor in a circle of N people, where every K-th person is eliminated. The standard solution uses a recursive relation or dynamic programming, typically achieving O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The result J(n, k) represents the survivor's original 0-indexed position among n people.; Each recursive step J(n, k) correctly transforms the result from J(n-1, k) based on the k-th elimination.
//   • Tips: Use 0-indexing for a simpler and more elegant recursive formula.; Establish the base case for N=1 (the survivor is always 0 or 1).
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when switching between 0-indexing and 1-indexing.; Incorrectly applying the modulo operator, especially with negative results in some languages.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
