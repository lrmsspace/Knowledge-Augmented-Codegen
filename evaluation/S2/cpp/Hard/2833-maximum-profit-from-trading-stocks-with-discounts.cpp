// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n, representing the number of employees in a company. Each employee is assigned a unique ID from 1 to n, and employee 1 is the CEO. You are given two 1-based integer arrays, present and future, each of length n, where:
//
//
// 	present[i] represents the current price at which the ith employee can buy a stock today.
// 	future[i] represents the expected price at which the ith employee can sell the stock tomorrow.
//
//
// The company's hierarchy is represented by a 2D integer array hierarchy, where hierarchy[i] = [ui, vi] means that employee ui is the direct boss of employee vi.
//
// Additionally, you have an integer budget representing the total funds available for investment.
//
// However, the company has a discount policy: if an employee's direct boss purchases their own stock, then the employee can buy their stock at half the original price (floor(present[v] / 2)).
//
// Return the maximum profit that can be achieved without exceeding the given budget.
//
// Note:
//
//
// 	You may buy each stock at most once.
// 	You cannot use any profit earned from future stock prices to fund additional investments and must buy only from budget.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 2, present = [1,2], future = [4,3], hierarchy = [[1,2]], budget = 3
//
// Output: 5
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
//
// 	Employee 1 buys the stock at price 1 and earns a profit of 4 - 1 = 3.
// 	Since Employee 1 is the direct boss of Employee 2, Employee 2 gets a discounted price of floor(2 / 2) = 1.
// 	Employee 2 buys the stock at price 1 and earns a profit of 3 - 1 = 2.
// 	The total buying cost is 1 + 1 = 2 <= budget. Thus, the maximum total profit achieved is 3 + 2 = 5.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 160
// 	present.length, future.length == n
// 	1 <= present[i], future[i] <= 50
// 	hierarchy.length == n - 1
// 	hierarchy[i] == [ui, vi]
// 	1 <= ui, vi <= n
// 	ui != vi
// 	1 <= budget <= 160
// 	There are no duplicate edges.
// 	Employee 1 is the direct or indirect boss of every employee.
// 	The input graph hierarchy is guaranteed to have no cycles.

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
// - Flows with demands (graph, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem involves finding a flow in a network where edges have both lower and upper capacity bounds, or nodes have supply/demand requirements, and an optimal value needs to be found.
//   • Idea: This technique transforms a network with lower and upper capacity bounds on edges (or node demands) into a standard max-flow problem. It often involves adding a new source and sink to handle demands, and then binary searching on the answer if an optimal value is sought, typically with O(MaxFlow * log(Range)) complexity.
//   • Invariants: The total flow out of the super source equals the total demand that needs to be satisfied.; For any node, the sum of incoming flow minus outgoing flow equals its net demand (0 for internal nodes in a circulation).
//   • Tips: Convert lower bounds to demands by adjusting capacities and adding a super source/sink.; A feasible flow exists if the max flow in the transformed network equals the total demand.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating residual capacities after demand satisfaction.; Forgetting to add a super source/sink for handling demands.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
