//
// Problem Description:
// Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.
//
// Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.
//
// The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.
//
// The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
//
// Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.
//
// Return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win, or "Tie" if they will end the game with the same score.
//
// Example:
// Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,7]
// Output: "Bob"
// Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= stoneValue.length <= 5 * 104
// 	-1000 <= stoneValue[i] <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Sprague-Grundy theorem. Nim (array, number, game-theory, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when analyzing impartial games with perfect information and no draws, especially to determine winning/losing states or to find a winning strategy. It's particularly useful for games that can be reduced to Nim.
//   • Idea: The Sprague-Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a Nim pile of a certain size (its nim-value or grundy number). For Nim, a position is a winning position if and only if the XOR sum of all pile sizes is non-zero, allowing for O(N) classification.
//   • Invariants: The XOR sum of the pile sizes (nim-sum) represents the game's current nim-value.; If the nim-sum is zero, any valid move will result in a non-zero nim-sum for the opponent.
//   • Tips: Understand the definition of impartial games and their properties.; Calculate the XOR sum of game components to determine the nim-sum.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing impartial games with partisan games where players have different moves.; Incorrectly calculating the XOR sum, leading to wrong state classifications.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
