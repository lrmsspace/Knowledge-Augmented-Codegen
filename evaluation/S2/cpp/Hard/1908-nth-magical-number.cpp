//
// Problem Description:
// A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either a or b.
//
// Given the three integers n, a, and b, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
// Output: 2
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 109
// 	2 <= a, b <= 4 * 104
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Discrete Logarithm (array, number, binary-search, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when solving for the exponent 'x' in the modular equation a^x = b (mod m), especially when 'm' is large and a and m are coprime. It's suitable for finding a solution within O(sqrt(m) log m) time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm, also known as Baby-step Giant-step, finds the smallest non-negative integer 'x' satisfying a^x = b (mod m) using a meet-in-the-middle approach. It achieves a time complexity of O(sqrt(m) log m).
//   • Invariants: The map stores (a^q mod m, q) for all baby steps q in [0, n-1].; For each giant step p, a^(np) mod m is correctly computed.
//   • Tips: Choose 'n' as ceil(sqrt(m)) for balanced steps.; Use a hash map to store baby steps for O(1) average lookup.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect choice of 'n' can lead to suboptimal time complexity.; Failure to check if 'a' and 'm' are coprime may yield no solution or incorrect results.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Factorial modulo 
// p (number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total count of possibilities or arrangements that can be naturally broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems. It's effective for exploring decision trees or state spaces.
//   • Idea: Counting determines the number of elements or event occurrences. It uses combinatorial or iterative/recursive methods, often with O(N) or O(log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each recursive call processes a smaller, well-defined subproblem.; The base cases correctly return the count for the simplest scenarios.
//   • Tips: Identify the smallest subproblem and its base cases to stop recursion.; Define the recursive relation clearly, showing how larger problems depend on smaller ones.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect results.; Overlapping subproblems without memoization can lead to exponential time complexity.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
