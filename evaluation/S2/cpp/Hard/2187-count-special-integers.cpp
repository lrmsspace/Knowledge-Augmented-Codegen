// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-special-integers/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// We call a positive integer special if all of its digits are distinct.
//
// Given a positive integer n, return the number of special integers that belong to the interval [1, n].
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 20
// Output: 19
// Explanation: All the integers from 1 to 20, except 11, are special. Thus, there are 19 special integers.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 2 * 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Euler's totient function
//  (array, number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. It is also efficient for computing totient values for all numbers in a given range.
//   • Idea: Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. It can be computed for a single n in O(sqrt(n)) using prime factorization, or for all numbers up to N in O(N log log N) using a sieve-like algorithm.
//   • Invariants: phi[i] stores the current totient value for i, which is i initially, then updated by (1 - 1/p) for each prime p dividing i.; After iterating through all primes p up to sqrt(N), phi[i] holds the correct totient value for all i <= N.
//   • Tips: For a single n, compute φ(n) using its prime factorization.; For all φ(i) up to N, use a sieve approach similar to Sieve of Eratosthenes.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 'relatively prime' with 'prime number'.; Applying the multiplicative property incorrectly when numbers share common factors.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
