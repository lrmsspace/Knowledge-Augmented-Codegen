//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n denoting the number of nodes of a weighted directed graph. The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1.
//
// You are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] denotes that there exists a directed edge from fromi to toi with weight weighti.
//
// Lastly, you are given three distinct integers src1, src2, and dest denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.
//
// Return the minimum weight of a subgraph of the graph such that it is possible to reach dest from both src1 and src2 via a set of edges of this subgraph. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return -1.
//
// A subgraph is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The weight of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5
// Output: 9
// Explanation:
// The above figure represents the input graph.
// The blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.
// Note that the subgraph [[1,0,3],[0,5,6]] also yields the optimal answer. It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= edges.length <= 105
// 	edges[i].length == 3
// 	0 <= fromi, toi, src1, src2, dest <= n - 1
// 	fromi != toi
// 	src1, src2, and dest are pairwise distinct.
// 	1 <= weight[i] <= 105

// - Shortest Paths (array, graph, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: To find the path with the minimum total weight or cost between two vertices, or from a single source to all other reachable vertices, in an edge-weighted graph.
//   • Idea: Shortest path algorithms determine the path with the least cumulative weight between nodes in a graph. This often involves a dynamic programming approach, iteratively updating minimum distances to achieve an optimal O(V*E) or O(E log V) complexity.
//   • Invariants: distTo[v] always stores the minimum path length from the source to v discovered so far.; For any edge u -> v, if distTo[u] is final, then distTo[v] will eventually be min(distTo[v], distTo[u] + weight(u,v)).
//   • Tips: Initialize the source distance to 0 and all other distances to infinity.; Use a `distTo` array to store the current shortest distances from the source.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to detect or handle negative cycles, which can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.; Incorrectly initializing distances or edge relaxation logic.
// - Second Best Minimum Spanning Tree (graph, tree, mst-kruskal, lca, binary-lifting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a spanning tree with the second smallest total edge weight, typically after finding the primary Minimum Spanning Tree.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the second best Minimum Spanning Tree by iterating through non-MST edges, adding each to the MST to form a cycle, and then removing the maximum weight edge on that cycle (excluding the added edge). It leverages Kruskal's for the initial MST and LCA with binary lifting for efficient path maximum queries, achieving an overall time complexity of O(E log E + E log V).
//   • Invariants: The initial MST is always a valid spanning tree with minimum total weight.; For any non-MST edge (u, v) added, a unique cycle is formed in the current graph.
//   • Tips: Precompute LCA and maximum edge weights on paths using binary lifting for efficiency.; The initial MST can be found using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the maximum weight edge on the cycle when adding a non-MST edge.; Forgetting to exclude the newly added edge itself when finding the maximum edge on the cycle.
// - Solving assignment problem using min-cost-flow (graph, dijkstra, bellman-ford)
//   • When to use: Use when finding a one-to-one assignment between two sets of entities, such as workers to tasks, to minimize the total cost. It's suitable for problems modelable as min-cost max-flow in a bipartite graph.
//   • Idea: This technique models the assignment problem as a minimum cost maximum flow problem on a specially constructed bipartite graph. It finds a perfect matching with the lowest total cost, typically with a polynomial time complexity depending on the shortest path algorithm used.
//   • Invariants: Flow conservation holds for all intermediate nodes in the network.; The flow on any edge never exceeds its defined capacity.
//   • Tips: Construct a bipartite graph with a source and sink nodes.; Set capacities to 1 for all assignment-related edges to ensure one-to-one mapping.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly modeling capacities or costs on graph edges can lead to wrong solutions.; Forgetting to ensure a perfect matching (flow value equals N) is found for a complete assignment.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
