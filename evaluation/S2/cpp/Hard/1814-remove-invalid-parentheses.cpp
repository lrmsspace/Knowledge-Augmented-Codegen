//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s that contains parentheses and letters, remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses to make the input string valid.
//
// Return a list of unique strings that are valid with the minimum number of removals. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "()())()"
// Output: ["(())()","()()()"]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 25
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters and parentheses '(' and ')'.
// 	There will be at most 20 parentheses in s.

// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
// - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to evaluate expressions given in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation) to compute their final numerical value.
//   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an expression in Reverse Polish Notation by processing elements sequentially. Numbers are pushed onto a stack, and operators pop two operands, compute, and push the result.
//   • Invariants: The stack always contains only numbers (operands or intermediate results).; For a valid RPN expression, the stack will have at least two elements when an operator is processed.
//   • Tips: Process the RPN expression from left to right, token by token.; Push numerical operands directly onto the stack.
//   • Pitfalls: Attempting to pop from an empty stack when an operator is encountered, indicating an invalid RPN expression.; Incorrect order of operands for non-commutative operations like subtraction or division.
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: When asked to count the total number of valid or well-formed bracket sequences of a certain length or with a specific number of pairs. This often involves combinatorial reasoning or dynamic programming.
//   • Idea: Counts the total number of valid bracket sequences of a given length or with a specific number of pairs, where each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. This problem often has a combinatorial solution, typically involving Catalan numbers, with a time complexity of O(N) or O(N^2) for DP.
//   • Invariants: At any prefix of the sequence, the number of open brackets is greater than or equal to the number of closing brackets.; The total number of open brackets in the sequence equals the total number of closing brackets.
//   • Tips: Recognize the pattern for Catalan numbers if applicable.; Dynamic programming can be used for more complex variations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the balance constraint (open count >= close count).; Overcounting or undercounting sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
