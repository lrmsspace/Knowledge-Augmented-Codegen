// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
//
// You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.
//
// You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].
//
// Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
// Output: 7
// Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
// Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
// The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
// 	0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
// 	1 <= d <= 10

// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (array, heap, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when given a set of tasks with deadlines and durations, and the objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks without interruption.
//   • Idea: This greedy algorithm aims to maximize the number of jobs completed by prioritizing tasks that finish earliest. It typically involves sorting and using a min-heap, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed up to the current point have been considered for scheduling.; The set of jobs in the heap represents the jobs currently scheduled to meet their deadlines.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by their deadlines in ascending order.; Maintain a min-heap of durations for jobs currently scheduled.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing job count maximization with total duration or profit.; Failing to update the current time correctly after scheduling a job.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and value, to maximize total value without exceeding a given capacity. It is applicable for resource allocation problems with discrete choices.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack Problem aims to choose items with maximum total value such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It is typically solved using dynamic programming, achieving a time complexity of O(nW) for n items and capacity W.
//   • Invariants: `dp[j]` (in 1D DP) represents the maximum value achievable with capacity `j` using items considered so far.; When processing item `i` and capacity `j` (decreasing `j`), `dp[j-weight_i]` holds the value from previous items for that reduced capacity.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP table with zeros for capacity 0 and unreachable states.; For 0-1 knapsack with 1D DP, iterate capacity `j` in decreasing order.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect iteration order for 1D DP in 0-1 knapsack (using increasing `j`).; Off-by-one errors in item indices or capacity calculations.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
public:
    int minDifficulty(vector<int>& jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.size();
        if (n < d) return -1; // Not enough jobs to fill all days

        vector<vector<int>> dp(d + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, INT_MAX));
        dp[0][0] = 0; // Base case: 0 days, 0 jobs

        for (int day = 1; day <= d; ++day) {
            for (int job = day; job <= n; ++job) {
                int maxDifficulty = 0;
                for (int k = job - 1; k >= day - 1; --k) {
                    maxDifficulty = max(maxDifficulty, jobDifficulty[k]);
                    if (dp[day - 1][k] != INT_MAX) {
                        dp[day][job] = min(dp[day][job], dp[day - 1][k] + maxDifficulty);
                    }
