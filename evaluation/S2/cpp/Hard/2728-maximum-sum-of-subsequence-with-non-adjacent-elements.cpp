//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array nums consisting of integers. You are also given a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [posi, xi].
//
// For query i, we first set nums[posi] equal to xi, then we calculate the answer to query i which is the maximum sum of a subsequence of nums where no two adjacent elements are selected.
//
// Return the sum of the answers to all queries.
//
// Since the final answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,5,9], queries = [[1,-2],[0,-3]]
//
// Output: 21
//
// Explanation:
// After the 1st query, nums = [3,-2,9] and the maximum sum of a subsequence with non-adjacent elements is 3 + 9 = 12.
// After the 2nd query, nums = [-3,-2,9] and the maximum sum of a subsequence with non-adjacent elements is 9.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
// 	-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 104
// 	queries[i] == [posi, xi]
// 	0 <= posi <= nums.length - 1
// 	-105 <= xi <= 105

// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, sparse-table, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to perform O(1) range queries on a static array for an associative operation, after an O(N log N) preprocessing step.
//   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries using an associative operation on a static array. It achieves O(1) query time and O(N log N) build time by storing prefix-like sums within logarithmically sized blocks.
//   • Invariants: For each level k, the array is partitioned into 2^k segments.; Within each segment, table[k][j] stores the result of the associative operation from j to the segment's midpoint (or midpoint to j).
//   • Tips: Ensure the operation is associative (e.g., min, max, sum, gcd, bitwise operations).; Preprocessing takes O(N log N) time and space.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for mutable arrays; updates require rebuilding the table.; Requires O(N log N) memory, which can be substantial for very large N.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
