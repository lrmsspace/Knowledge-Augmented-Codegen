//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, represented by a 2D array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates a directed edge from node ui to vi. Each node has an associated score given in an array score, where score[i] represents the score of node i.
//
// You must process the nodes in a valid topological order. Each node is assigned a 1-based position in the processing order.
//
// The profit is calculated by summing up the product of each node's score and its position in the ordering.
//
// Return the maximum possible profit achievable with an optimal topological order.
//
// A topological order of a DAG is a linear ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge u → v, node u comes before v in the ordering.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], score = [2,3]
//
// Output: 8
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
// Node 1 depends on node 0, so a valid order is [0, 1].
//

// 			2nd
// 			3
// 			2
// 			3 × 2 = 6
// 		
// 	
//
//
// The maximum total profit achievable over all valid topological orders is 2 + 6 = 8.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == score.length <= 22
// 	1 <= score[i] <= 105
// 	0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
// 	edges[i] == [ui, vi] denotes a directed edge from ui to vi.
// 	0 <= ui, vi < n
// 	ui != vi
// 	The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
// 	There are no duplicate edges.

// - Shortest Paths (graph, topo, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: This algorithm finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with arbitrary edge weights.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) by processing vertices in topological order, relaxing outgoing edges. It achieves a time complexity of O(V + E).
//   • Invariants: The distance to the source vertex, distTo[s], remains 0 throughout the algorithm.; For any vertex v, distTo[v] always stores the shortest path found so far from s to v.
//   • Tips: First, perform a topological sort on the DAG to determine the processing order.; Initialize all distances to infinity, except the source vertex which is zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying this algorithm to a graph containing cycles will yield incorrect results.; An incorrect topological sort order will lead to incorrect shortest path calculations.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
