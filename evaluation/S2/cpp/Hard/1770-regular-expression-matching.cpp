// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:
//
//
// 	'.' Matches any single character.​​​​
// 	'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
//
//
// The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
// Output: false
// Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 20
// 	1 <= p.length <= 20
// 	s contains only lowercase English letters.
// 	p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
// 	It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.

// - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
// - Tries (trie, array, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing string keys in a symbol table and needing efficient prefix, wildcard, or longest prefix matching operations, offering flexibility beyond binary search trees and speed comparable to hashing.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where keys are typically strings. It allows for efficient retrieval of keys based on their prefixes, achieving O(L) time complexity for operations, where L is the key length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node exists only if it is part of at least one stored key.
//   • Tips: Choose an appropriate branching factor (R) based on the alphabet size.; Represent children using arrays for fixed alphabets or hash maps for sparse ones.
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or sparse data.; Deletion of keys can be complex, requiring careful handling of empty branches.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
