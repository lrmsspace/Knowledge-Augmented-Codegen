// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.
//
// Return a list answer of size 2 where:
//
//
// 	answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
// 	answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
//
//
// The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.
//
// Note:
//
//
// 	You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
// 	The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.
//
// Example:
// Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
// Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
// Explanation:
// Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
// Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
// Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
// Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= matches.length <= 105
// 	matches[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= winneri, loseri <= 105
// 	winneri != loseri
// 	All matches[i] are unique.

// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, linked-list, union-find, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and perform union operations to merge sets or find the representative of an element's set efficiently. It's suitable for problems involving dynamic connectivity or grouping elements.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: finding the representative of an element's set and merging two sets. It achieves nearly constant time complexity for these operations with path compression and union by rank/size optimizations.
//   • Invariants: Every element `i` belongs to exactly one set, represented by `find(i)`.; If `parent[i] == i`, then `i` is the representative (root) of its set.
//   • Tips: Implement path compression in `find` for optimal performance.; Use union by size or rank to maintain balanced trees.
//   • Pitfalls: Omitting path compression or union by rank/size can degrade performance to O(N).; Failing to correctly update auxiliary data stored at representatives during a union operation.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
