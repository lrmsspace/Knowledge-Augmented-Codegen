// Problem Description:
// A 0-indexed array derived with length n is derived by computing the bitwise XOR (⊕) of adjacent values in a binary array original of length n.
//
// Specifically, for each index i in the range [0, n - 1]:
//
//
// 	If i = n - 1, then derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[0].
// 	Otherwise, derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[i + 1].
//
//
// Given an array derived, your task is to determine whether there exists a valid binary array original that could have formed derived.
//
// Return true if such an array exists or false otherwise.
//
//
// 	A binary array is an array containing only 0's and 1's
//
// Example:
// Input: derived = [1,1,0]
// Output: true
// Explanation: A valid original array that gives derived is [0,1,0].
// derived[0] = original[0] ⊕ original[1] = 0 ⊕ 1 = 1 
// derived[1] = original[1] ⊕ original[2] = 1 ⊕ 0 = 1
// derived[2] = original[2] ⊕ original[0] = 0 ⊕ 0 = 0
//
// Constraints:
// n == derived.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	The values in derived are either 0's or 1's

// - Sprague-Grundy theorem. Nim (array, number, game-theory, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when analyzing impartial games with perfect information and no draws, especially to determine winning/losing states or to find a winning strategy. It's particularly useful for games that can be reduced to Nim.
//   • Idea: The Sprague-Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a Nim pile of a certain size (its nim-value or grundy number). For Nim, a position is a winning position if and only if the XOR sum of all pile sizes is non-zero, allowing for O(N) classification.
//   • Invariants: The XOR sum of the pile sizes (nim-sum) represents the game's current nim-value.; If the nim-sum is zero, any valid move will result in a non-zero nim-sum for the opponent.
//   • Tips: Understand the definition of impartial games and their properties.; Calculate the XOR sum of game components to determine the nim-sum.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing impartial games with partisan games where players have different moves.; Incorrectly calculating the XOR sum, leading to wrong state classifications.
// - Check whether a graph is bipartite (graph, queue, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to determine if an undirected graph can be divided into two independent sets such that all edges connect vertices from different sets, or if it is two-colorable.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if an undirected graph is bipartite by attempting to 2-color it using BFS. It assigns alternating colors (or sets) to adjacent vertices, detecting non-bipartite conditions if an edge connects two vertices of the same color.
//   • Invariants: All visited vertices within the current BFS component are correctly 2-colored.; All edges processed so far connect vertices of different colors.
//   • Tips: Use two distinct colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to represent the two sets.; Iterate through all vertices and start a new BFS from any unvisited vertex to handle disconnected components.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected graphs by ensuring all vertices are visited.; Incorrectly assigning colors, leading to false positives or negatives.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
