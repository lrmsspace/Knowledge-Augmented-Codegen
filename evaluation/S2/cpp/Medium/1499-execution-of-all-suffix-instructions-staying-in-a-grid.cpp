//
// Problem Description:
// There is an n x n grid, with the top-left cell at (0, 0) and the bottom-right cell at (n - 1, n - 1). You are given the integer n and an integer array startPos where startPos = [startrow, startcol] indicates that a robot is initially at cell (startrow, startcol).
//
// You are also given a 0-indexed string s of length m where s[i] is the ith instruction for the robot: 'L' (move left), 'R' (move right), 'U' (move up), and 'D' (move down).
//
// The robot can begin executing from any ith instruction in s. It executes the instructions one by one towards the end of s but it stops if either of these conditions is met:
//
//
// 	The next instruction will move the robot off the grid.
// 	There are no more instructions left to execute.
//
//
// Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the number of instructions the robot can execute if the robot begins executing from the ith instruction in s.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, startPos = [0,1], s = "RRDDLU"
// Output: [1,5,4,3,1,0]
// Explanation: Starting from startPos and beginning execution from the ith instruction:
// - 0th: "RRDDLU". Only one instruction "R" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
// - 1st:  "RDDLU". All five instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 1).
// - 2nd:   "DDLU". All four instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 0).
// - 3rd:    "DLU". All three instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (0, 0).
// - 4th:     "LU". Only one instruction "L" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
// - 5th:      "U". If moving up, it would move off the grid.
//
// Constraints:
// m == s.length
// 	1 <= n, m <= 500
// 	startPos.length == 2
// 	0 <= startrow, startcol < n
// 	s consists of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Z-function and its calculation (string, array, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a pattern within a text, or to identify repeated prefixes within a string efficiently.
//   • Idea: The Z-function computes an array where each element z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the string and its suffix starting at index i. It runs in linear time, O(N), where N is the length of the string.
//   • Invariants: For all j < i, z[j] correctly stores the length of the longest common prefix between S and S[j...].; The segment [l, r-1] represents the rightmost segment that is a prefix of S and has been fully processed.
//   • Tips: Initialize z[0] to 0 (or N, depending on definition) and handle it as a base case.; Utilize previously computed Z-values to avoid redundant comparisons, especially within the 'rightmost matching segment' [l, r].
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating or using the 'rightmost matching segment' boundaries (l and r).; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices or lengths, especially with 0-based vs. 1-based indexing.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
//   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
//   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
