// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array nums, return true if there exists a triple of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]. If no such indices exists, return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
// Output: true
// Explanation: Any triplet where i < j < k is valid.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 105
// 	-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Could you implement a solution that runs in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity?

// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal ordering of non-contiguous elements.
//   • Idea: This DP approach calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in an array. It builds upon previously computed subsequence lengths, resulting in an O(N^2) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] stores the length of the LIS ending at index i.; For any j < i, if A[j] < A[i], then dp[j] + 1 is a candidate length for dp[i].
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element itself forms an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling the strict increasing condition (e.g., allowing equality).
// - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, stack, simulation, monotonic-stack)
//   • When to use: This technique is used to answer Range Minimum Queries efficiently on a static array by transforming them into Lowest Common Ancestor queries on a Cartesian Tree.
//   • Idea: This approach solves Range Minimum Query problems by constructing a Cartesian Tree from the input array, where the root of any subtree is its minimum element. RMQ for a given range then reduces to finding the Lowest Common Ancestor of the range's endpoints in this tree, allowing O(N) construction and O(1) query time after O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian Tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the subtree rooted at `u`.; For any node `u`, all nodes in its left subtree have indices smaller than `index(u)`, and all nodes in its right subtree have indices larger than `index(u)`.
//   • Tips: A Cartesian Tree is a binary tree where each node's value is less than its children's values, and an in-order traversal yields the original array.; Utilize a monotonic stack to construct the Cartesian Tree in linear O(N) time.
//   • Pitfalls: Correctly implementing the monotonic stack for Cartesian Tree construction can be challenging.; Edge cases, such as an empty stack or handling the last elements during tree building, must be managed carefully.
// - Ternary Search (interval, number, binary-search, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use Ternary Search to find the minimum or maximum of a unimodal or bitonic function over a continuous or discrete interval. It is effective when the function's derivative is hard to compute or unavailable.
//   • Idea: Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that repeatedly narrows down the search space for the extremum of a unimodal function by evaluating two points within the current interval. It reduces the search interval by one-third in each step, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function lies within the current interval [l, r].; The function value at m1 is compared with m2 to narrow the search.
//   • Tips: Ensure the function is strictly unimodal or bitonic within the search range.; Handle floating-point precision carefully for continuous functions.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying to non-unimodal functions yields incorrect results.; Floating-point errors can lead to incorrect bounds or infinite loops.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
