//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array original of length n and a 2D array bounds of length n x 2, where bounds[i] = [ui, vi].
//
// You need to find the number of possible arrays copy of length n such that:
//
//
// 	(copy[i] - copy[i - 1]) == (original[i] - original[i - 1]) for 1 <= i <= n - 1.
// 	ui <= copy[i] <= vi for 0 <= i <= n - 1.
//
//
// Return the number of such arrays.
//
// Example:
// Input: original = [1,2,3,4], bounds = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
// The possible arrays are:
//
//
// 	[1, 2, 3, 4]
// 	[2, 3, 4, 5]
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n == original.length <= 105
// 	1 <= original[i] <= 109
// 	bounds.length == n
// 	bounds[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= bounds[i][0] <= bounds[i][1] <= 109

// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
