//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of positive integers nums.
//
// You need to select a subset of nums which satisfies the following condition:
//
//
// 	You can place the selected elements in a 0-indexed array such that it follows the pattern: [x, x2, x4, ..., xk/2, xk, xk/2, ..., x4, x2, x] (Note that k can be be any non-negative power of 2). For example, [2, 4, 16, 4, 2] and [3, 9, 3] follow the pattern while [2, 4, 8, 4, 2] does not.
//
//
// Return the maximum number of elements in a subset that satisfies these conditions.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [5,4,1,2,2]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can select the subset {4,2,2}, which can be placed in the array as [2,4,2] which follows the pattern and 22 == 4. Hence the answer is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109

// - Sqrt Tree (array, number, bitmask-dp, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Used for answering range queries on a static array by recursively decomposing it into square root sized blocks, achieving O(log log N) query time.
//   • Idea: A Sqrt Tree is a recursive data structure that decomposes an array into blocks of square root size, building a similar structure on each block. It allows for efficient range queries, typically achieving O(log log N) query time after an O(N log log N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the Sqrt Tree represents a contiguous segment of the original array.; A node representing a segment of length k has sqrt(k) children, each covering a block of sqrt(k) elements.
//   • Tips: Precompute answers for all possible block combinations within a node.; Handle queries spanning multiple blocks by combining precomputed prefix, suffix, and full block results.
//   • Pitfalls: High constant factors due to complex precomputation per node.; Memory usage can be significant, O(N log log N), for large N.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to efficiently calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer. It is applicable in number theory problems or combinatorial tasks involving factors.
//   • Idea: This method computes the number of divisors and sum of divisors of an integer n by first finding its prime factorization. The core idea leverages properties of multiplicative functions, with a typical complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for factorization.
//   • Invariants: During prime factorization, temp_n always holds the remaining unfactored part of the original number.; The current_prime_factor iterates through potential prime divisors in increasing order.
//   • Tips: First find the prime factorization n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak.; Number of divisors d(n) = (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the special case of n=1 (1 divisor, sum 1).; Incorrectly calculating powers or sums, especially for large exponents.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
