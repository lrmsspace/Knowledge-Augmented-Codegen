// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/frequency-of-the-most-frequent-element/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// The frequency of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.
//
// You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. In one operation, you can choose an index of nums and increment the element at that index by 1.
//
// Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most k operations.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
// 4 has a frequency of 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= k <= 105
//

// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It provides logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that can efficiently update individual elements and calculate prefix sums in an array. Both operations are performed in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each `tree[i]` element stores the sum of a contiguous range of elements from the original array, specifically from `i - (i & -i) + 1` to `i` (inclusive, 1-based).; After any `update(idx, val)` operation, `query(idx)` will reflect the new sum up to `idx`.
//   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for array elements to simplify bitwise logic; The `idx & -idx` operation is key to navigating the implicit tree structure
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-based and 1-based indexing can lead to incorrect results; Off-by-one errors when calculating range sums (e.g., `query(R) - query(L-1)`)
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
