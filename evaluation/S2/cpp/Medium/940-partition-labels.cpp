// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string "ababcc" can be partitioned into ["abab", "cc"], but partitions such as ["aba", "bcc"] or ["ab", "ab", "cc"] are invalid.
//
// Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.
//
// Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
// Output: [9,7,8]
// Explanation:
// The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
// This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
// A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 500
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters.

// - Finding repetitions (string, array, z-function, enumeration)
//   • When to use: This algorithm efficiently finds all repetitions (periodic substrings) within a given string by combining divide-and-conquer with the Z-function. It is particularly useful for identifying overlapping or crossing periodic patterns.
//   • Idea: The Main-Lorentz algorithm finds all repetitions in a string by recursively splitting it into halves and identifying 'crossing repetitions' using the Z-function. This approach achieves an optimal O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed `cntr` position, all identified crossing repetitions have a total length of $2 	imes (|u| - cntr)$.; The segment $u[cntr - k_1 	ext{ to } cntr - 1]$ is identical to $u[|u| - k_1 	ext{ to } |u| - 1]$.
//   • Tips: Employ divide-and-conquer to break the problem into subproblems for repetitions within halves and crossing repetitions.; Utilize the Z-function to compute $k_1$ and $k_2$ values in O(1) for each `cntr` position, speeding up crossing repetition detection.
//   • Pitfalls: Correctly identifying and defining 'crossing repetitions' is the most intricate part of the algorithm.; Careful implementation of the Z-function for both the original and reversed string segments is crucial.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
// - String Sorts (array, string, number, radix-sort, counting-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting a large collection of fixed-length strings or integers, especially when the key range (alphabet size) is small. It is efficient for data with uniform key lengths.
//   • Idea: LSD Radix Sort sorts elements by processing digits or characters from the least significant to the most significant, using a stable counting sort for each position. It achieves a time complexity of O(W * (N + R)), where W is the key length, N is the number of items, and R is the radix.
//   • Invariants: After each pass 'd' (from 'w-1' down to '0'), the array 'a' is stably sorted based on characters from position 'd' to 'w-1'.; The 'count' array accurately reflects the frequency of each character at the current digit 'd' before cumulation.
//   • Tips: Utilize counting sort as the stable inner sorting algorithm for each digit pass.; Process characters or digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for variable-length strings without proper padding or specialized handling.; Can be slower than comparison sorts for small input sizes or very large radix (R).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
