// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-rounds-to-complete-all-tasks/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array tasks, where tasks[i] represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level.
//
// Return the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.
//
// Example:
// Input: tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
// - In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
// - In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
// - In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
// - In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
// It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= tasks.length <= 105
// 	1 <= tasks[i] <= 109
//

// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
// - Check whether a graph is bipartite (graph, queue, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to determine if an undirected graph can be divided into two independent sets such that all edges connect vertices from different sets, or if it is two-colorable.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if an undirected graph is bipartite by attempting to 2-color it using BFS. It assigns alternating colors (or sets) to adjacent vertices, detecting non-bipartite conditions if an edge connects two vertices of the same color.
//   • Invariants: All visited vertices within the current BFS component are correctly 2-colored.; All edges processed so far connect vertices of different colors.
//   • Tips: Use two distinct colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to represent the two sets.; Iterate through all vertices and start a new BFS from any unvisited vertex to handle disconnected components.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected graphs by ensuring all vertices are visited.; Incorrectly assigning colors, leading to false positives or negatives.
// - Ternary Search (interval, number, binary-search, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use Ternary Search to find the minimum or maximum of a unimodal or bitonic function over a continuous or discrete interval. It is effective when the function's derivative is hard to compute or unavailable.
//   • Idea: Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that repeatedly narrows down the search space for the extremum of a unimodal function by evaluating two points within the current interval. It reduces the search interval by one-third in each step, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function lies within the current interval [l, r].; The function value at m1 is compared with m2 to narrow the search.
//   • Tips: Ensure the function is strictly unimodal or bitonic within the search range.; Handle floating-point precision carefully for continuous functions.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying to non-unimodal functions yields incorrect results.; Floating-point errors can lead to incorrect bounds or infinite loops.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
