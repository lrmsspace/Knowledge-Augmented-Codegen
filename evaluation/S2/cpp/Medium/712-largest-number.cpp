//
// Problem Description:
// Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.
//
// Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [10,2]
// Output: "210"
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - String Sorts (array, string, number, radix-sort, recursion, counting-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting a large collection of strings or integers with a limited range of character/digit values. It is particularly efficient for fixed-length keys but can be adapted for variable lengths.
//   • Idea: Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits or characters which share the same significant position and value. It typically achieves O(N*W) time complexity, where N is the number of items and W is the key length.
//   • Invariants: After each pass `d`, the elements are stably sorted according to their digits up to position `d`.; The counting sort subroutine correctly places elements into their sorted positions for the current digit, preserving relative order.
//   • Tips: LSD (Least Significant Digit) is simpler for fixed-length keys.; MSD (Most Significant Digit) is better for variable-length keys or when keys are very long.
//   • Pitfalls: Not efficient for small N or very large W due to constant factors.; Requires extra space for auxiliary array and counting array.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine to minimize the total weighted completion time, where each job has a processing time and a linear penalty coefficient.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine with linear penalty functions by sorting jobs based on a specific ratio. It achieves an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The partial schedule constructed so far is optimal for the jobs included.; For any two adjacent jobs 'j' and 'k' in the final schedule, if 'j' precedes 'k', then 'c_j/t_j >= c_k/t_k'.
//   • Tips: Derive the sorting criterion using an exchange argument for adjacent jobs.; The optimal order is determined by the ratio of cost coefficient to processing time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the sorting criterion, especially the ratio order.; Overlooking edge cases like zero processing times or zero penalty coefficients.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
