// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/high-access-employees/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D 0-indexed array of strings, access_times, with size n. For each i where 0 <= i <= n - 1, access_times[i][0] represents the name of an employee, and access_times[i][1] represents the access time of that employee. All entries in access_times are within the same day.
//
// The access time is represented as four digits using a 24-hour time format, for example, "0800" or "2250".
//
// An employee is said to be high-access if he has accessed the system three or more times within a one-hour period.
//
// Times with exactly one hour of difference are not considered part of the same one-hour period. For example, "0815" and "0915" are not part of the same one-hour period.
//
// Access times at the start and end of the day are not counted within the same one-hour period. For example, "0005" and "2350" are not part of the same one-hour period.
//
// Return a list that contains the names of high-access employees with any order you want.
//
// Example:
// Input: access_times = [["a","0549"],["b","0457"],["a","0532"],["a","0621"],["b","0540"]]
// Output: ["a"]
// Explanation: "a" has three access times in the one-hour period of [05:32, 06:31] which are 05:32, 05:49, and 06:21.
// But "b" does not have more than two access times at all.
// So the answer is ["a"].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= access_times.length <= 100
// 	access_times[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= access_times[i][0].length <= 10
// 	access_times[i][0] consists only of English small letters.
// 	access_times[i][1].length == 4
// 	access_times[i][1] is in 24-hour time format.
// 	access_times[i][1] consists only of '0' to '9'.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - N/A
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
