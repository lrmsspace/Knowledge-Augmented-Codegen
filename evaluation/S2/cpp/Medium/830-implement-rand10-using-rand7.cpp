// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-rand10-using-rand7/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the API rand7() that generates a uniform random integer in the range [1, 7], write a function rand10() that generates a uniform random integer in the range [1, 10]. You can only call the API rand7(), and you shouldn't call any other API. Please do not use a language's built-in random API.
//
// Each test case will have one internal argument n, the number of times that your implemented function rand10() will be called while testing. Note that this is not an argument passed to rand10().
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 1
// Output: [2]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
//
//
//  
// Follow up:
//
//
// 	What is the expected value for the number of calls to rand7() function?
// 	Could you minimize the number of calls to rand7()?
//

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).

// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
// - Rejection sampling (number, rejection-sampling)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to generate random samples from a complex or non-standard probability distribution for which direct sampling methods are difficult or impossible. It's effective when a suitable proposal distribution can be found.
//   • Idea: Rejection sampling generates random variates from a target probability distribution by drawing samples from a simpler proposal distribution and accepting or rejecting them based on a calculated probability. This method ensures accepted samples conform to the target distribution, with an average time complexity dependent on the efficiency of the proposal.
//   • Invariants: The scaled proposal distribution c * g(x) always majorizes the target distribution f(x) for all x.; Each candidate sample x_candidate is drawn independently from the proposal distribution g(x).
//   • Tips: Choose a proposal distribution g(x) that is easy to sample from and closely resembles the target f(x).; Ensure the scaled proposal c * g(x) completely envelops f(x) for all x.
//   • Pitfalls: An inefficient proposal distribution (e.g., c is too large) leads to a high rejection rate and slow sampling.; Failing to ensure c * g(x) >= f(x) for all x will result in an incorrect sample distribution.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

// The rand7() API is already defined for you.
// int rand7();
// @return a random integer in the range 1 to 7
