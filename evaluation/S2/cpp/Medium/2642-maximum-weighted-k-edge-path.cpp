// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-weighted-k-edge-path/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n and a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates a directed edge from node ui to vi with weight wi.
//
// You are also given two integers, k and t.
//
// Your task is to determine the maximum possible sum of edge weights for any path in the graph such that:
//
//
// 	The path contains exactly k edges.
// 	The total sum of edge weights in the path is strictly less than t.
//
//
// Return the maximum possible sum of weights for such a path. If no such path exists, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,2]], k = 2, t = 4
//
// Output: 3
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
//
// 	The only path with k = 2 edges is 0 -> 1 -> 2 with weight 1 + 2 = 3 < t.
// 	Thus, the maximum possible sum of weights less than t is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 300
// 	0 <= edges.length <= 300
// 	edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]
// 	0 <= ui, vi < n
// 	ui != vi
// 	1 <= wi <= 10
// 	0 <= k <= 300
// 	1 <= t <= 600
// 	The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
// 	There are no duplicate edges.

// - Finding a negative cycle in the graph (graph, array, bellman-ford)
//   • When to use: Use when a graph may contain negative edge weights and you need to find the shortest paths from a single source, or specifically to detect and identify negative cycles.
//   • Idea: The Bellman-Ford algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in a weighted graph, even with negative edge weights, and can detect negative cycles. It has a time complexity of O(VE).
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, dist[v] is the shortest path from the source to v using at most k edges.; If no negative cycle is reachable, dist[v] will be the true shortest path distance after V-1 iterations.
//   • Tips: Perform V-1 iterations for shortest path calculation, then one more for cycle detection.; A negative cycle exists if any distance can still be reduced in the V-th iteration.
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for graphs with only non-negative weights compared to Dijkstra's.; Does not directly work for undirected graphs with negative edges.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
// - Second Best Minimum Spanning Tree (graph, tree, mst-kruskal, lca, binary-lifting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a spanning tree with the second smallest total edge weight, typically after finding the primary Minimum Spanning Tree.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the second best Minimum Spanning Tree by iterating through non-MST edges, adding each to the MST to form a cycle, and then removing the maximum weight edge on that cycle (excluding the added edge). It leverages Kruskal's for the initial MST and LCA with binary lifting for efficient path maximum queries, achieving an overall time complexity of O(E log E + E log V).
//   • Invariants: The initial MST is always a valid spanning tree with minimum total weight.; For any non-MST edge (u, v) added, a unique cycle is formed in the current graph.
//   • Tips: Precompute LCA and maximum edge weights on paths using binary lifting for efficiency.; The initial MST can be found using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the maximum weight edge on the cycle when adding a non-MST edge.; Forgetting to exclude the newly added edge itself when finding the maximum edge on the cycle.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
