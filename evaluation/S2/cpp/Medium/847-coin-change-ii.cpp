//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
//
// Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.
//
// You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
//
// The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.
//
// Example:
// Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
// 5=5
// 5=2+2+1
// 5=2+1+1+1
// 5=1+1+1+1+1
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= coins.length <= 300
// 	1 <= coins[i] <= 5000
// 	All the values of coins are unique.
// 	0 <= amount <= 5000

// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Binomial Coefficients (number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to calculate multiple binomial coefficients or when a single coefficient is required and N and K are not excessively large, allowing for table precomputation.
//   • Idea: This method computes binomial coefficients C(n, k) using Pascal's recurrence relation C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k), typically building a table. It has a time complexity of O(N*K) or O(N^2) for building the full triangle up to N.
//   • Invariants: C[i][0] is always 1 for any row i.; C[i][i] is always 1 for any row i.
//   • Tips: Intermediate results for Pascal's Triangle never exceed the final answer, simplifying overflow checks if not using modular arithmetic.; Each new table element requires only one addition, making it computationally efficient per element.
//   • Pitfalls: Building the entire Pascal's Triangle for a single C(N, K) can be slow for large N and K, as it computes many unnecessary values.; Directly computing C(N, K) using factorials can lead to overflow issues for large N, even if the final result fits.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1; // Base case: There's one way to make the amount 0 (using no coins)

        for (const int& coin : coins) {
            for (int j = coin; j <= amount; ++j) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - coin]; // Update the number of ways to make amount j
            }
        }
