// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-connectable-servers-in-a-weighted-tree-network/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an unrooted weighted tree with n vertices representing servers numbered from 0 to n - 1, an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional edge between vertices ai and bi of weight weighti. You are also given an integer signalSpeed.
//
// Two servers a and b are connectable through a server c if:
//
//
// 	a < b, a != c and b != c.
// 	The distance from c to a is divisible by signalSpeed.
// 	The distance from c to b is divisible by signalSpeed.
// 	The path from c to b and the path from c to a do not share any edges.
//
//
// Return an integer array count of length n where count[i] is the number of server pairs that are connectable through the server i.
//
// Example:
// Input: edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,5],[2,3,13],[3,4,9],[4,5,2]], signalSpeed = 1
// Output: [0,4,6,6,4,0]
// Explanation: Since signalSpeed is 1, count[c] is equal to the number of pairs of paths that start at c and do not share any edges.
// In the case of the given path graph, count[c] is equal to the number of servers to the left of c multiplied by the servers to the right of c.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 1000
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i].length == 3
// 	0 <= ai, bi < n
// 	edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti]
// 	1 <= weighti <= 106
// 	1 <= signalSpeed <= 106
// 	The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
// - Counting labeled graphs (number, dp-2d, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: When counting the total number of labeled graphs with a specific number of vertices and connected components. Useful for problems requiring enumeration of graph structures based on their connectivity properties.
//   • Idea: This technique uses dynamic programming to count labeled graphs with a given number of vertices and connected components by building up solutions from smaller subproblems. It leverages a recurrence relation that considers the component containing a specific vertex, leading to an O(N^2 * K) time complexity for N vertices and K components.
//   • Invariants: D[i][j] correctly stores the number of labeled graphs with i vertices and j components.; All C_s values for s < n are correctly precomputed before calculating D[n][k].
//   • Tips: Precompute binomial coefficients for efficiency.; Precompute the number of connected graphs (C_s) for all relevant s.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for the dynamic programming table.; Off-by-one errors in binomial coefficient calculations or array indexing.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
