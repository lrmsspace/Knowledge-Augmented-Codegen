// Problem Description:
// We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:
//
//
// 	I pick a number between 1 and n.
// 	You guess a number.
// 	If you guess the right number, you win the game.
// 	If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.
// 	Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.
//
//
// Given a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 10
// Output: 16
// Explanation: The winning strategy is as follows:
// - The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.
//     - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.
//     - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.
//         - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.
//         - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
//         - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
//     - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.
//         - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.
//         - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.
//             - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.
//             - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
//             - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
//         - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.
//             - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
//             - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.
// The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.

// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 200
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Fibonacci Numbers (number, recursion, binary-lifting)
//   • When to use: Use when computing the N-th Fibonacci number for extremely large N, or when the result needs to be calculated modulo a specific value, requiring logarithmic time complexity.
//   • Idea: This method computes the N-th Fibonacci number by leveraging matrix exponentiation or specific doubling identities, reducing the problem size by half in each step. It achieves an O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The function `compute(n)` always returns the pair `(F_n, F_{n+1})`.; For any `k`, the values `F_k` and `F_{k+1}` are correctly computed before deriving `F_{2k}` and `F_{2k+1}`.
//   • Tips: Utilize matrix exponentiation for a general and robust approach.; The doubling identities F_2k+1 and F_2k can be faster than explicit matrix multiplication.
//   • Pitfalls: Integer overflow if modulo arithmetic or arbitrary-precision integers are not used for large N.; Incorrectly defining base cases in the recursive implementation can lead to errors.
// - Knuth's Optimization (array, interval, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When a range DP problem has a recurrence of the form dp(i, j) = min_k [dp(i, k) + dp(k+1, j) + C(i, j)] and the optimal splitting points satisfy opt(i, j-1) <= opt(i, j) <= opt(i+1, j).
//   • Idea: Knuth's Optimization is a technique to speed up certain dynamic programming problems on ranges from O(N^3) to O(N^2) time complexity. It applies when the optimal splitting point for a subproblem exhibits a monotonic property across adjacent subproblems.
//   • Invariants: dp[i][j] stores the minimum cost for the interval [i, j].; opt[i][j] stores the optimal split point k for interval [i, j].
//   • Tips: Verify the quadrangle inequality for the cost function C(i, j).; Ensure the optimal split points exhibit monotonicity: opt(i, j-1) <= opt(i, j) <= opt(i+1, j).
//   • Pitfalls: Applying the optimization without rigorously verifying the monotonicity condition.; Incorrectly calculating the cost function C(i, j) or its properties.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n - len + 1; ++i) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = i; k <= j; ++k) {
                    int cost = k + max(k > i ? dp[i][k - 1] : 0, k < j ? dp[k + 1][j] : 0);
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], cost);
