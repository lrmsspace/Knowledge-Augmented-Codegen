// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-servers-that-communicate/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a map of a server center, represented as a m * n integer matrix grid, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.
//
// Return the number of servers that communicate with any other server.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: No servers can communicate with others.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m <= 250
// 	1 <= n <= 250
// 	grid[i][j] == 0 or 1

// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Kirchhoff's theorem. Finding the number of spanning trees (graph, matrix, counting)
//   • When to use: Used to determine the exact count of distinct spanning trees in a connected undirected graph, even when multiple edges are present. It is particularly useful for problems requiring precise enumeration of graph structures.
//   • Idea: This theorem calculates the number of spanning trees in a graph by finding the determinant of any cofactor of its Laplacian matrix. The typical complexity for an N-vertex graph is O(N^3) due to matrix determinant calculation.
//   • Invariants: The sum of degrees in the graph is always twice the number of edges.; The sum of any row or column in the Laplacian matrix is zero.
//   • Tips: Construct the Laplacian matrix (L = D - A) carefully, ensuring correct degrees and adjacency entries.; Account for multiple edges by summing their counts in the adjacency matrix and degree matrix.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating vertex degrees, especially with multiple edges or self-loops.; Using the determinant of the full Laplacian matrix, which is always zero.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
