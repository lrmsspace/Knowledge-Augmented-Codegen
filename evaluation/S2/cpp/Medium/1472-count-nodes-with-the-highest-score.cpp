// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-with-the-highest-score/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a binary tree rooted at 0 consisting of n nodes. The nodes are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 0-indexed integer array parents representing the tree, where parents[i] is the parent of node i. Since node 0 is the root, parents[0] == -1.
//
// Each node has a score. To find the score of a node, consider if the node and the edges connected to it were removed. The tree would become one or more non-empty subtrees. The size of a subtree is the number of the nodes in it. The score of the node is the product of the sizes of all those subtrees.
//
// Return the number of nodes that have the highest score.
//
// Example:
// Input: parents = [-1,2,0,2,0]
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// - The score of node 0 is: 3 * 1 = 3
// - The score of node 1 is: 4 = 4
// - The score of node 2 is: 1 * 1 * 2 = 2
// - The score of node 3 is: 4 = 4
// - The score of node 4 is: 4 = 4
// The highest score is 4, and three nodes (node 1, node 3, and node 4) have the highest score.
//
// Constraints:
// n == parents.length
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	parents[0] == -1
// 	0 <= parents[i] <= n - 1 for i != 0
// 	parents represents a valid binary tree.

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Finding articulation points in a graph in O(N+M) (graph, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when identifying critical nodes whose removal would increase the number of connected components in an undirected graph. It's essential for analyzing network robustness and vulnerability.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all articulation points (cut vertices) in an undirected graph using a single Depth First Search traversal. It operates in linear time, O(N+M), where N is vertices and M is edges.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u`, `tin[u]` is its discovery time, and `low[u]` is initialized to `tin[u]`.; After visiting all children `v` of `u` (and their subtrees), `low[u]` will hold the minimum `tin` value reachable from `u` or its descendants via tree edges and at most one back-edge.
//   • Tips: Initialize `tin` (discovery time) and `low` (lowest reachable ancestor) arrays for all vertices.; The root of the DFS tree is an articulation point if it has more than one child in the DFS tree.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize `low[u]` with `tin[u]` before processing children.; Incorrectly applying the `tin[u] <= low[v]` condition to the root node of the DFS tree.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when counting labeled trees or converting between a labeled tree and a unique sequence representation for combinatorial analysis. It provides a bijection for problems involving N labeled nodes.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence of length N-2 that represents a labeled tree with N nodes. It is constructed by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor, and can be reconstructed back into the tree.
//   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always contains N-2 elements for a tree with N nodes.; At each step of encoding, the removed node is a leaf with the smallest label among all current leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for efficient updates.; Use a min-priority queue to quickly find the smallest-labeled leaf.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating node degrees after removal.; Off-by-one errors when dealing with 0-indexed vs. 1-indexed labels.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
