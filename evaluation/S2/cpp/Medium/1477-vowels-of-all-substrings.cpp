//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string word, return the sum of the number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') in every substring of word.
//
// A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.
//
// Note: Due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32-bit integer. Please be careful during the calculations.
//
// Example:
// Input: word = "aba"
// Output: 6
// Explanation: 
// All possible substrings are: "a", "ab", "aba", "b", "ba", and "a".
// - "b" has 0 vowels in it
// - "a", "ab", "ba", and "a" have 1 vowel each
// - "aba" has 2 vowels in it
// Hence, the total sum of vowels = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= word.length <= 105
// 	word consists of lowercase English letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Suffix Automaton (string, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently represent all substrings of a given string and perform various string operations like counting distinct substrings or pattern matching in linear time.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal finite automaton that accepts all suffixes of a given string. It implicitly represents all substrings and can be constructed in linear time, O(N) where N is the string length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the initial state spells a substring of the original string.; Each state represents a set of substrings that share the same end positions in the original string.
//   • Tips: Understand the concept of `endpos` sets and how they define states.; The number of states and transitions in a suffix automaton is linear with respect to string length.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm can be complex and prone to off-by-one errors or incorrect link updates.; Debugging state transitions and suffix links requires careful attention.
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare strings, find duplicate strings, or perform fast substring searches and pattern matching in O(1) time after initial O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to a numerical value using a polynomial function, enabling O(1) comparison of strings or substrings after O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: prefix_hash[i] stores the polynomial hash of the substring s[0...i-1].; p_power[k] stores p^k mod m for efficient calculation.
//   • Tips: Use two different hash functions with distinct prime `p` and `m` values to minimize collision probability.; Precompute powers of `p` and prefix hashes to enable O(1) substring hash calculation.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions can lead to incorrect results; always consider their possibility.; Integer overflow if modulo operations are not applied correctly at each step of calculation.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
