// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertions-to-balance-a-parentheses-string/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a parentheses string s containing only the characters '(' and ')'. A parentheses string is balanced if:
//
//
// 	Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis '))'.
// 	Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis '))'.
//
//
// In other words, we treat '(' as an opening parenthesis and '))' as a closing parenthesis.
//
//
// 	For example, "())", "())(())))" and "(())())))" are balanced, ")()", "()))" and "(()))" are not balanced.
//
//
// You can insert the characters '(' and ')' at any position of the string to balance it if needed.
//
// Return the minimum number of insertions needed to make s balanced.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "(()))"
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The second '(' has two matching '))', but the first '(' has only ')' matching. We need to add one more ')' at the end of the string to be "(())))" which is balanced.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s consists of '(' and ')' only.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this when verifying if a sequence of delimiters is correctly nested and balanced. It is also applicable for counting or generating all possible valid sequences of a given length.
//   • Idea: This algorithm involves checking if a sequence of opening and closing delimiters is properly matched and nested, or enumerating such sequences. Validation typically uses a stack in O(N) time, while generation often involves backtracking with O(Catalan(N)) complexity.
//   • Invariants: The stack contains only opening delimiters that are yet to be matched.; The balance counter (open - close) is never negative at any point during traversal.
//   • Tips: Use a stack to track unmatched opening delimiters for validation.; Maintain a balance counter (increment for open, decrement for close) for a simpler check.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if the stack is empty after processing the entire sequence.; Allowing a closing delimiter when no matching opening delimiter is available (empty stack or mismatch).
// - Z-function and its calculation (string, array, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the length of the longest common prefix between a string and all its suffixes efficiently. It is fundamental for various string matching and pattern searching problems.
//   • Idea: The Z-function computes an array where each element z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the original string and its suffix starting at index i. This algorithm calculates the entire Z-array in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For all k < i, z[k] has been correctly computed.; The interval [l, r) always represents the rightmost segment match found so far.
//   • Tips: Leverage previously computed Z-values to avoid redundant comparisons.; Maintain a [l, r) window representing the rightmost segment match found so far.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the base case z[0] (usually set to 0).; Off-by-one errors when calculating the length of the prefix or updating the window.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
