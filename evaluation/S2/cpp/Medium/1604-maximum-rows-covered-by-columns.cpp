// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-rows-covered-by-columns/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an m x n binary matrix matrix and an integer numSelect.
//
// Your goal is to select exactly numSelect distinct columns from matrix such that you cover as many rows as possible.
//
// A row is considered covered if all the 1's in that row are also part of a column that you have selected. If a row does not have any 1s, it is also considered covered.
//
// More formally, let us consider selected = {c1, c2, ...., cnumSelect} as the set of columns selected by you. A row i is covered by selected if:
//
//
// 	For each cell where matrix[i][j] == 1, the column j is in selected.
// 	Or, no cell in row i has a value of 1.
//
//
// Return the maximum number of rows that can be covered by a set of numSelect columns.
//
// Example:
// Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]], numSelect = 2
//
// Output: 3
//
// Explanation:
//
// One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above.
// We choose s = {0, 2}.
// - Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1.
// - Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s.
// - Row 2 is not covered because matrix[2][1] == 1 but 1 is not present in s.
// - Row 3 is covered because matrix[2][2] == 1 and 2 is present in s.
// Thus, we can cover three rows.
// Note that s = {1, 2} will also cover 3 rows, but it can be shown that no more than three rows can be covered.
//
// Constraints:
// m == matrix.length
// 	n == matrix[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 12
// 	matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
// 	1 <= numSelect <= n

// - Finding the rank of a matrix (matrix, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix. It's also applicable for understanding the dimension of the vector space spanned by the matrix's rows or columns.
//   • Idea: Determines the rank of a matrix by transforming it into row echelon form using Gaussian elimination. The rank is the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form, with a time complexity of O(N^3).
//   • Invariants: The number of non-zero rows processed so far equals the current rank.; All elements below the pivot in the current column are zeroed out.
//   • Tips: Always choose the largest absolute value pivot for numerical stability.; Swap rows to bring a non-zero element to the pivot position.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect zero checks.; Forgetting to increment rank only when a valid pivot is found.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
