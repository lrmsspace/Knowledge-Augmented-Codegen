// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/reach-end-of-array-with-max-score/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums of length n.
//
// Your goal is to start at index 0 and reach index n - 1. You can only jump to indices greater than your current index.
//
// The score for a jump from index i to index j is calculated as (j - i) * nums[i].
//
// Return the maximum possible total score by the time you reach the last index.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,3,1,5]
//
// Output: 7
//
// Explanation:
//
// First, jump to index 1 and then jump to the last index. The final score is 1 * 1 + 2 * 3 = 7.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
//   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It is applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered selections from a sequence.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or with a greedy approach using binary search in O(N log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or equivalent) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index `i`, `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1` found so far.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains a 'tails' array where tails[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Use binary search (specifically `lower_bound` for strictly increasing) to find the correct position to update the 'tails' array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray; elements do not need to be contiguous.; Incorrectly applying binary search (e.g., using `upper_bound` instead of `lower_bound` for strict increase).
// - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in order. It is efficient for both convex and non-convex polygons.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing signed trapezoidal areas formed by each edge and the x-axis, or equivalently, using the shoelace formula. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of vertices.
//   • Invariants: Vertices are processed sequentially in their given order, forming edges.; The running sum `current_sum` accumulates the signed contribution from each edge processed so far.
//   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in a consistent order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; Use a data type with sufficient range (e.g., long long or double) for intermediate sums to prevent overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect vertex order will result in an incorrect signed area or even zero.; Integer overflow can occur if coordinates are large and sums exceed standard integer limits.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
