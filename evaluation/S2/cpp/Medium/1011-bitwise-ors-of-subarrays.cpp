// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array arr, return the number of distinct bitwise ORs of all the non-empty subarrays of arr.
//
// The bitwise OR of a subarray is the bitwise OR of each integer in the subarray. The bitwise OR of a subarray of one integer is that integer.
//
// A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [0]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: There is only one possible result: 0.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 104
// 	0 <= arr[i] <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Range Minimum Query (array, bitset, bit-fenwick)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently query the minimum value within a range and perform point updates on an array. It's suitable for scenarios requiring logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick tree (BIT) can be adapted to answer Range Minimum Queries and perform point updates in O(log N) time. It achieves this by storing prefix minimums in a tree-like structure, allowing efficient aggregation.
//   • Invariants: Each node `tree[i]` stores the minimum of a specific range `[i - (i & -i) + 1, i]`.; An update to `arr[idx]` correctly propagates the new minimum to all relevant `tree` nodes.
//   • Tips: Adapt standard BIT operations for minimums instead of sums.; Use `min(current_value, new_value)` for updates and queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Standard BIT operations are for sums; direct application for minimums is incorrect.; Querying a range `[L, R]` for minimum is not a simple `query(R) - query(L-1)`.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
