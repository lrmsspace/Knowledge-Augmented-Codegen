// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-stones-until-consecutive/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There are three stones in different positions on the X-axis. You are given three integers a, b, and c, the positions of the stones.
//
// In one move, you pick up a stone at an endpoint (i.e., either the lowest or highest position stone), and move it to an unoccupied position between those endpoints. Formally, let's say the stones are currently at positions x, y, and z with x < y < z. You pick up the stone at either position x or position z, and move that stone to an integer position k, with x < k < z and k != y.
//
// The game ends when you cannot make any more moves (i.e., the stones are in three consecutive positions).
//
// Return an integer array answer of length 2 where:
//
//
// 	answer[0] is the minimum number of moves you can play, and
// 	answer[1] is the maximum number of moves you can play.
//
// Example:
// Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 5
// Output: [1,2]
// Explanation: Move the stone from 5 to 3, or move the stone from 5 to 4 to 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= a, b, c <= 100
// 	a, b, and c have different values.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
// - Ternary Search (interval, number, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a continuous interval, where the function strictly increases then decreases, or vice versa.
//   • Idea: Ternary search is an optimization algorithm that efficiently finds the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a continuous interval. It operates in logarithmic time, O(log N), by repeatedly narrowing the search space.
//   • Invariants: The global extremum of the unimodal function is always contained within the current interval [l, r].; The function f(x) remains unimodal on the interval [l, r] throughout the search process.
//   • Tips: For floating-point functions, use a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 100-300) instead of an epsilon threshold for robustness.; The two comparison points m1 and m2 should divide the interval into three roughly equal parts for optimal convergence.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying ternary search to a non-unimodal function will not guarantee finding the global extremum.; Floating-point precision errors can lead to incorrect comparisons or infinite loops if epsilon is too small.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
