// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sub-islands/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two m x n binary matrices grid1 and grid2 containing only 0's (representing water) and 1's (representing land). An island is a group of 1's connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.
//
// An island in grid2 is considered a sub-island if there is an island in grid1 that contains all the cells that make up this island in grid2.
//
// Return the number of islands in grid2 that are considered sub-islands.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid1 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,1,1]], grid2 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.
// The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are three sub-islands.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid1.length == grid2.length
// 	n == grid1[i].length == grid2[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 500
// 	grid1[i][j] and grid2[i][j] are either 0 or 1.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - N/A
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

public:
    int countSubIslands(vector<vector<int>>& grid1, vector<vector<int>>& grid2) {
        int m = grid1.size(), n = grid1[0].size();
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid2[i][j] == 1 && dfs(grid1, grid2, i, j)) {
                    ++count;
                }
            }
