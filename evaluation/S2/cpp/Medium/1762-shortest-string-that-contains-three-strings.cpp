// Problem Description:
// Given three strings a, b, and c, your task is to find a string that has the minimum length and contains all three strings as substrings.
// If there are multiple such strings, return the lexicographically smallest one.
//
// Return a string denoting the answer to the problem.
//
// Notes
//
//
// 	A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
// 	A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
//
// Example:
// Input: a = "abc", b = "bca", c = "aaa"
// Output: "aaabca"
// Explanation:  We show that "aaabca" contains all the given strings: a = ans[2...4], b = ans[3..5], c = ans[0..2]. It can be shown that the length of the resulting string would be at least 6 and "aaabca" is the lexicographically smallest one.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= a.length, b.length, c.length <= 100
// 	a, b, c consist only of lowercase English letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - Aho-Corasick algorithm (trie, graph, bfs, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns within a larger text. It is ideal for scenarios requiring simultaneous searching for multiple dictionary words.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a set of patterns, allowing linear time searching for all pattern occurrences in a text. It extends a trie with suffix links and failure transitions for efficient traversal, achieving O(N + M + K) complexity where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: All nodes at depth 'd' have their suffix links correctly computed before processing nodes at depth 'd+1'.; For any node 'u', its suffix link points to the longest proper suffix of the string represented by 'u' that is also a prefix of some pattern.
//   • Tips: Build the trie from all patterns first, marking nodes that represent the end of a pattern.; Compute suffix links using a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the root.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly computing suffix links can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; High memory usage can occur for large alphabets or a vast number of patterns.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
