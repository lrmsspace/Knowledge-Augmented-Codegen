// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.
//
// Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.
//
// A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
// Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
// It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 105
// 	s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.

// - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when processing all suffixes or substrings of a string, especially for tasks requiring counting distinct substrings or efficient pattern matching. It is particularly useful for incremental string construction.
//   • Idea: The Suffix Automaton is a directed acyclic graph that represents all distinct substrings of a given string. It has a linear number of states and transitions, allowing for efficient string processing in O(N) time complexity for construction.
//   • Invariants: The automaton correctly represents all distinct substrings of the string processed up to the current character.; Each state corresponds to an equivalence class of substrings sharing the same end positions.
//   • Tips: Mark terminal states by traversing suffix links from the state representing the full string.; The `last` pointer always tracks the state for the entire string processed.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the three cases for adding a new character can lead to an invalid automaton.; Forgetting to update the `last` state after each character addition breaks incremental construction.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
