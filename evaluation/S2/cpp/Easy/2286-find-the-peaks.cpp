//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array mountain. Your task is to find all the peaks in the mountain array.
//
// Return an array that consists of indices of peaks in the given array in any order.
//
// Notes:
//
//
// 	A peak is defined as an element that is strictly greater than its neighboring elements.
// 	The first and last elements of the array are not a peak.
//
// Example:
// Input: mountain = [2,4,4]
// Output: []
// Explanation: mountain[0] and mountain[2] can not be a peak because they are first and last elements of the array.
// mountain[1] also can not be a peak because it is not strictly greater than mountain[2].
// So the answer is [].
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= mountain.length <= 100
// 	1 <= mountain[i] <= 100
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It is applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered selections from a sequence.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or with a greedy approach using binary search in O(N log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or equivalent) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index `i`, `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1` found so far.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains a 'tails' array where tails[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Use binary search (specifically `lower_bound` for strictly increasing) to find the correct position to update the 'tails' array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray; elements do not need to be contiguous.; Incorrectly applying binary search (e.g., using `upper_bound` instead of `lower_bound` for strict increase).
// -  
// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, quickselect)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without fully sorting the entire data structure. It's particularly useful for large datasets where a full sort is too slow.
//   • Idea: Quickselect is a selection algorithm that finds the Kth smallest element in an unsorted list. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach similar to Quicksort, but only recurses on one side, achieving an average time complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to the pivot's value.; All elements to the right of the pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot's value.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot strategy, such as a random pivot, to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; Handle duplicate elements carefully during the partitioning step to ensure correctness.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Deep recursion without tail call optimization can cause stack overflow errors.
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, recursion)
//   • When to use: When searching for the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a continuous or discrete interval. It is efficient for functions where direct differentiation or analytical solutions are complex.
//   • Idea: Ternary search is an algorithm that efficiently finds the extremum of a unimodal function within a given interval by repeatedly narrowing the search space. It typically achieves a logarithmic time complexity, O(log N), where N is the interval size.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function always lies within the current search interval [l, r].; The function value at m1 is compared with m2 to narrow the interval while preserving unimodality.
//   • Tips: Ensure the function is strictly unimodal within the search interval.; Handle discrete intervals carefully, especially the stopping condition (r - l) < 3.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying to non-unimodal functions yields incorrect results.; Incorrect stopping conditions can lead to infinite loops or suboptimal answers.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
