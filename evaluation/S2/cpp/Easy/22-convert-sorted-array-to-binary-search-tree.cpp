//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
// Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
// Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 104
// 	-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
// 	nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Segment Tree (tree, array, segment-tree, merge-sort, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use when processing range queries or updates on an array, or when efficient searching and sorting of data are required. It's also applicable for problems that can be broken down into smaller, independent subproblems.
//   • Idea: This card describes techniques for efficiently handling range queries and updates on arrays, as well as searching and sorting elements. These methods typically achieve logarithmic time complexity for operations.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree represents a specific range of the original array.; The target element, if present, is always within the current binary search interval [low, high].
//   • Tips: Segment trees are powerful for static arrays with dynamic queries.; Merge sort's divide-and-conquer approach can be adapted for counting inversions.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in binary search bounds.; Incorrect segment tree node merging logic.
// - Treap (Cartesian tree) (tree, array, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a dynamic data structure is needed to support efficient array-like operations (insert, delete, range queries/updates) on an ordered sequence, especially with frequent modifications at arbitrary positions.
//   • Idea: A Treap is a randomized binary search tree that maintains both BST properties on keys and heap properties on randomly assigned priorities. It supports various dynamic array operations and range queries/updates in expected O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: For any node, its key is greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than all keys in its right subtree.; For any node, its priority is greater than or equal to the priorities of its children.
//   • Tips: Use random priorities to ensure probabilistic balance, avoiding worst-case O(N) operations.; Implement `split` and `merge` as fundamental building blocks for all other operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to push lazy tags before accessing children or performing splits/merges.; Incorrectly updating `cnt` or aggregate fields after tree modifications.
// - Balanced Search Trees (tree, ds, recursion)
//   • When to use: When needing a self-balancing search tree that guarantees logarithmic time complexity for search and insertion operations. Useful for maintaining data in sorted order with consistent performance, especially when frequent updates are expected.
//   • Idea: A 2-3 tree is a self-balancing search tree where every node has either two children (a 2-node) or three children (a 3-node), ensuring all leaves are at the same depth. It guarantees O(log N) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
//   • Invariants: All leaves are at the same depth from the root.; Every node is either a 2-node (one key, two children) or a 3-node (two keys, three children).
//   • Tips: Understand the two node types: 2-nodes (one key, two children) and 3-nodes (two keys, three children).; Insertion always starts by finding the leaf position, then propagates splits upwards if a 4-node is formed.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the promotion of keys during node splits can break the tree's structure.; Forgetting to update parent links after a node split or merge operation.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
