// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
//
// Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
//
// The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
// Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
// Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
// The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
//
// Constraints:
// nums1.length == m + n
// 	nums2.length == n
// 	0 <= m, n <= 200
// 	1 <= m + n <= 200
// 	-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Minkowski sum of convex polygons (geometry, array, two-pointers, sweep-line)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to compute the Minkowski sum of two convex polygons efficiently. It is ideal for applications requiring the union of shapes or collision detection between convex objects.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes the Minkowski sum of two convex polygons by merging their edge vectors, sorted by polar angle, into a new sequence of edges. The resulting sum polygon is also convex and can be constructed in O(|P| + |Q|) time.
//   • Invariants: The current vertex of the resulting sum polygon is the sum of the current vertices from P and Q.; All edges processed so far from both input polygons have been added to the output in polar angle order.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort polygon vertices to start from the lowest Y-coordinate to ensure consistent orientation.; Orient both input polygons counter-clockwise for correct edge vector generation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling polygon orientation (e.g., mixing clockwise and counter-clockwise).; Precision issues when using floating-point numbers for angle comparisons or vector additions.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
