// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
//
// A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
// Output: true
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= s.length <= 100
// 	0 <= t.length <= 104
// 	s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

// - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently represent all distinct substrings of a string, or perform various string operations like counting unique substrings, finding occurrences, or string matching in an online fashion.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a powerful data structure that represents all distinct substrings of a given string in a compact form, typically as a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG). It can be constructed in linear time O(N) and space O(N) for a string of length N.
//   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end-positions in the original string.; For any state `v`, `len(v)` is the length of the longest string represented by `v`.
//   • Tips: Understand the properties of `len` (length of the longest string in a state) and `link` (suffix link to the longest proper suffix).; The construction is online, processing characters one by one from left to right.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `link` updates, especially when cloning states during construction.; Forgetting to update the `last` pointer after each character addition step.
// - Tries (trie, tree, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing a collection of strings and requiring efficient prefix-based operations like search, insertion, deletion, or finding the longest common prefix.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where nodes represent characters and paths from the root represent strings. Operations like insertion, search, and deletion typically take O(L) time, where L is the length of the key.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node's children pointers correspond to the next character in a string.
//   • Tips: Mark nodes as 'end of word' to distinguish prefixes from complete words.; Use an array for children pointers if the alphabet size is small and fixed (e.g., ASCII).
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or very deep tries due to many empty child pointers.; Deletion can be complex, requiring careful handling of nodes that are part of other words.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
