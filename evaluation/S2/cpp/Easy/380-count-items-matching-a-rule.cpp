// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-items-matching-a-rule/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.
//
// The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:
//
//
// 	ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
// 	ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
// 	ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
//
//
// Return the number of items that match the given rule.
//
// Example:
// Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
// Output: 1
// Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= items.length <= 104
// 	1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10
// 	ruleKey is equal to either "type", "color", or "name".
// 	All strings consist only of lowercase letters.

// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Tries (trie, array, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing string keys in a symbol table and needing efficient prefix, wildcard, or longest prefix matching operations, offering flexibility beyond binary search trees and speed comparable to hashing.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where keys are typically strings. It allows for efficient retrieval of keys based on their prefixes, achieving O(L) time complexity for operations, where L is the key length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node exists only if it is part of at least one stored key.
//   • Tips: Choose an appropriate branching factor (R) based on the alphabet size.; Represent children using arrays for fixed alphabets or hash maps for sparse ones.
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or sparse data.; Deletion of keys can be complex, requiring careful handling of empty branches.
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total number of valid arrangements of opening and closing brackets, ensuring all pairs are matched and correctly nested. It applies to combinatorial problems requiring structured pairing.
//   • Idea: This technique counts the number of ways to form sequences of opening and closing brackets such that they are balanced and properly nested. It is a classic combinatorial problem, typically solved in O(N) or O(N^2) time.
//   • Invariants: At any point in sequence construction, the count of open brackets placed must be greater than or equal to the count of closed brackets placed.; The total number of open brackets in a complete valid sequence must exactly equal the total number of closed brackets.
//   • Tips: Recognize the connection to Catalan numbers for common variations (e.g., N pairs of parentheses).; Dynamic programming can solve more complex variations with different bracket types or constraints.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the 'prefix sum' condition: the count of open brackets must always be greater than or equal to close brackets at any point.; Incorrectly applying Catalan numbers to problems with additional constraints or different bracket types.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
