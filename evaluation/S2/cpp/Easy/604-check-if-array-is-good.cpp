//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums. We consider an array good if it is a permutation of an array base[n].
//
// base[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] (in other words, it is an array of length n + 1 which contains 1 to n - 1 exactly once, plus two occurrences of n). For example, base[1] = [1, 1] and base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].
//
// Return true if the given array is good, otherwise return false.
//
// Note: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2, 1, 3]
// Output: false
// Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	1 <= num[i] <= 200
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total number of valid arrangements of opening and closing brackets, ensuring all pairs are matched and correctly nested. It applies to combinatorial problems requiring structured pairing.
//   • Idea: This technique counts the number of ways to form sequences of opening and closing brackets such that they are balanced and properly nested. It is a classic combinatorial problem, typically solved in O(N) or O(N^2) time.
//   • Invariants: At any point in sequence construction, the count of open brackets placed must be greater than or equal to the count of closed brackets placed.; The total number of open brackets in a complete valid sequence must exactly equal the total number of closed brackets.
//   • Tips: Recognize the connection to Catalan numbers for common variations (e.g., N pairs of parentheses).; Dynamic programming can solve more complex variations with different bracket types or constraints.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the 'prefix sum' condition: the count of open brackets must always be greater than or equal to close brackets at any point.; Incorrectly applying Catalan numbers to problems with additional constraints or different bracket types.
// - Burnside's lemma / Pólya enumeration theorem (array, number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting the number of distinct configurations or arrangements of objects under a set of symmetry operations, where configurations are considered identical if one can be transformed into another by a group action.
//   • Idea: Burnside's Lemma and Pólya Enumeration Theorem are combinatorial tools used to count the number of distinct objects under a group of symmetries. Both typically involve iterating through group elements and analyzing permutation cycle structures, often resulting in polynomial time complexity depending on group size and element analysis.
//   • Invariants: The set of group elements considered remains consistent throughout the summation.; Each group element's cycle decomposition is correctly identified.
//   • Tips: Identify the group of symmetry operations acting on the objects.; For each group element, determine its permutation cycle structure.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the full set of distinct group operations.; Errors in determining the cycle structure of permutations.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
