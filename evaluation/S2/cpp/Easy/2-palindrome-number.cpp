// Problem Description:
// Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: x = 121
// Output: true
// Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
//
// Constraints:
// -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
// - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
//   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
//   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
// - Bit manipulation (number, counting)
//   • When to use: When you need to manipulate individual bits within an integer, optimize space, or perform fast operations on boolean flags or small sets. It's ideal for low-level control and specific integer property checks.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shifts. These operations allow for efficient setting, clearing, flipping, and checking of individual bits, typically with O(1) complexity per operation.
//   • Invariants: The state of any bit `i` where `i != x` is preserved during an operation on the `x`-th bit.; After `n = n | (1 << x)`, the `x`-th bit of `n` is 1.
//   • Tips: Use `1 << x` to create a mask for the x-th bit.; Understand the difference between `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>` operators.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect operator precedence (e.g., `&` vs `&&`).; Off-by-one errors with bit indices (0-indexed vs 1-indexed).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
