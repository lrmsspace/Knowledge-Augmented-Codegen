// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
//
//
// struct Node {
//   int val;
//   Node *left;
//   Node *right;
//   Node *next;
// }
//
//
// Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
//
// Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
// Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
// Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 212 - 1].
// 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
//
//
//  
// Follow-up:
//
//
// 	You may only use constant extra space.
// 	The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, queue, array, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) from a source node to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph. It is also suitable for exploring a graph layer by layer.
//   • Idea: BFS systematically explores a graph level by level, starting from a source node, ensuring all nodes at a given distance are visited before moving to the next distance level. It operates in O(N + M) time for N vertices and M edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or adjacent distance level from the source.; The 'used' array accurately reflects all nodes that have been added to the queue for processing.
//   • Tips: Always use a queue to maintain the order of nodes to visit.; Utilize a 'visited' array or set to prevent revisiting nodes and infinite loops.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not find shortest paths in weighted graphs unless weights are 0 or 1 (use Dijkstra for general weighted graphs).; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to incorrect results or TLE.
// - Sqrt Tree (array, number, bitmask-dp, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Used for answering range queries on a static array by recursively decomposing it into square root sized blocks, achieving O(log log N) query time.
//   • Idea: A Sqrt Tree is a recursive data structure that decomposes an array into blocks of square root size, building a similar structure on each block. It allows for efficient range queries, typically achieving O(log log N) query time after an O(N log log N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the Sqrt Tree represents a contiguous segment of the original array.; A node representing a segment of length k has sqrt(k) children, each covering a block of sqrt(k) elements.
//   • Tips: Precompute answers for all possible block combinations within a node.; Handle queries spanning multiple blocks by combining precomputed prefix, suffix, and full block results.
//   • Pitfalls: High constant factors due to complex precomputation per node.; Memory usage can be significant, O(N log log N), for large N.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
