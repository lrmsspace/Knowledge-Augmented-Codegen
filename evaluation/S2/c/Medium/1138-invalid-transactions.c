// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/invalid-transactions/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// A transaction is possibly invalid if:
//
//
// 	the amount exceeds $1000, or;
// 	if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.
//
//
// You are given an array of strings transaction where transactions[i] consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.
//
// Return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
// Output: ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
// Explanation: The first transaction is invalid because the second transaction occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.
//
// Constraints:
// transactions.length <= 1000
// 	Each transactions[i] takes the form "{name},{time},{amount},{city}"
// 	Each {name} and {city} consist of lowercase English letters, and have lengths between 1 and 10.
// 	Each {time} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 1000.
// 	Each {amount} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 2000.

// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently compare strings or substrings, detect duplicates, or perform pattern matching in large text datasets. It's particularly useful for speeding up operations that would otherwise be O(N*M) or O(N^2).
//   • Idea: String hashing maps strings to numerical values, allowing for fast comparisons and operations like substring search. It typically uses a polynomial rolling hash function, achieving O(N) preprocessing and O(1) or O(log N) query time for substrings.
//   • Invariants: The hash of any prefix of the string is correctly computed based on its characters and chosen parameters.; For a rolling hash, the hash of the current window is always maintained correctly as the window slides.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime modulus (or two) to minimize collision probability.; Select a base (prime number) larger than the alphabet size to ensure unique contributions from characters.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions are possible and can lead to incorrect results if not properly handled or verified.; A poorly chosen base or modulus can significantly increase the frequency of collisions.
// - Second Best Minimum Spanning Tree (graph, tree, mst-kruskal, lca, binary-lifting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a spanning tree with the second smallest total edge weight, typically after finding the primary Minimum Spanning Tree.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the second best Minimum Spanning Tree by iterating through non-MST edges, adding each to the MST to form a cycle, and then removing the maximum weight edge on that cycle (excluding the added edge). It leverages Kruskal's for the initial MST and LCA with binary lifting for efficient path maximum queries, achieving an overall time complexity of O(E log E + E log V).
//   • Invariants: The initial MST is always a valid spanning tree with minimum total weight.; For any non-MST edge (u, v) added, a unique cycle is formed in the current graph.
//   • Tips: Precompute LCA and maximum edge weights on paths using binary lifting for efficiency.; The initial MST can be found using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the maximum weight edge on the cycle when adding a non-MST edge.; Forgetting to exclude the newly added edge itself when finding the maximum edge on the cycle.
// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (array, heap, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when given a set of tasks with deadlines and durations, and the objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks without interruption.
//   • Idea: This greedy algorithm aims to maximize the number of jobs completed by prioritizing tasks that finish earliest. It typically involves sorting and using a min-heap, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed up to the current point have been considered for scheduling.; The set of jobs in the heap represents the jobs currently scheduled to meet their deadlines.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by their deadlines in ascending order.; Maintain a min-heap of durations for jobs currently scheduled.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing job count maximization with total duration or profit.; Failing to update the current time correctly after scheduling a job.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
