//
// Problem Description:
// You are participating in an online chess tournament. There is a chess round that starts every 15 minutes. The first round of the day starts at 00:00, and after every 15 minutes, a new round starts.
//
//
// 	For example, the second round starts at 00:15, the fourth round starts at 00:45, and the seventh round starts at 01:30.
//
//
// You are given two strings loginTime and logoutTime where:
//
//
// 	loginTime is the time you will login to the game, and
// 	logoutTime is the time you will logout from the game.
//
//
// If logoutTime is earlier than loginTime, this means you have played from loginTime to midnight and from midnight to logoutTime.
//
// Return the number of full chess rounds you have played in the tournament.
//
// Note: All the given times follow the 24-hour clock. That means the first round of the day starts at 00:00 and the last round of the day starts at 23:45.
//
// Example:
// Input: loginTime = "09:31", logoutTime = "10:14"
// Output: 1
// Explanation: You played one full round from 09:45 to 10:00.
// You did not play the full round from 09:30 to 09:45 because you logged in at 09:31 after it began.
// You did not play the full round from 10:00 to 10:15 because you logged out at 10:14 before it ended.
//
// Constraints:
// loginTime and logoutTime are in the format hh:mm.
// 	00 <= hh <= 23
// 	00 <= mm <= 59
// 	loginTime and logoutTime are not equal.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Check if two segments intersect (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this when determining if two line segments in a 2D plane share any common points, especially when floating-point precision issues need to be avoided.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect by handling collinear and non-collinear cases separately, primarily using integer arithmetic to avoid precision errors. It typically runs in O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: If segments are collinear, their 1D projections on both axes must overlap for intersection.; If segments are not collinear, each segment's endpoints must lie on opposite sides of the line containing the other segment.
//   • Tips: Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.; Utilize cross products for efficient orientation checks.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly identify and handle collinear segments.; Introducing floating-point errors by using division for slopes.
// - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
//   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
//   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
