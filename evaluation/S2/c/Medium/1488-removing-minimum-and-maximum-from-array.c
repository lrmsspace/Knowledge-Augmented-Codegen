// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-minimum-and-maximum-from-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array of distinct integers nums.
//
// There is an element in nums that has the lowest value and an element that has the highest value. We call them the minimum and maximum respectively. Your goal is to remove both these elements from the array.
//
// A deletion is defined as either removing an element from the front of the array or removing an element from the back of the array.
//
// Return the minimum number of deletions it would take to remove both the minimum and maximum element from the array.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,10,7,5,4,1,8,6]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: 
// The minimum element in the array is nums[5], which is 1.
// The maximum element in the array is nums[1], which is 10.
// We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 2 elements from the front and 3 elements from the back.
// This results in 2 + 3 = 5 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	The integers in nums are distinct.

// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
// - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (queue, deque, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: Use this technique when you need to perform standard queue or stack operations while also querying the minimum (or maximum) element in O(1) time. It is ideal for problems involving sliding windows or dynamic collections where min/max queries are frequent.
//   • Idea: This technique augments a queue or stack with an auxiliary data structure, typically a deque, to maintain elements in monotonic order. This allows for O(1) retrieval of the minimum (or maximum) element, with standard operations achieving amortized O(1) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The auxiliary deque stores elements in non-decreasing order from front to back.; The element at the front of the auxiliary deque is the minimum of all elements currently in the main queue/stack.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque for the auxiliary structure to efficiently add and remove from both ends.; For a minimum queue, maintain the auxiliary deque in non-decreasing order from front to back.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling removals when the element to be removed from the main structure is not the current minimum.; Forgetting to remove elements from the auxiliary deque when they are no longer relevant (e.g., out of window bounds).
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
