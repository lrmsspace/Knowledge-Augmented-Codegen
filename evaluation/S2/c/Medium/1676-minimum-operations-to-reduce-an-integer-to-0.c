// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-an-integer-to-0/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a positive integer n, you can do the following operation any number of times:
//
//
// 	Add or subtract a power of 2 from n.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of operations to make n equal to 0.
//
// A number x is power of 2 if x == 2i where i >= 0.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 39
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can do the following operations:
// - Add 20 = 1 to n, so now n = 40.
// - Subtract 23 = 8 from n, so now n = 32.
// - Subtract 25 = 32 from n, so now n = 0.
// It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations we need to make n equal to 0.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Binary Exponentiation (number, mod-exp, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating a^n efficiently, especially for large n or when results need to be taken modulo some number. It reduces the number of multiplications from linear to logarithmic.
//   • Idea: Binary exponentiation computes a^n by repeatedly squaring the base and multiplying terms corresponding to the set bits in the exponent's binary representation. This method achieves a time complexity of O(log n) multiplications.
//   • Invariants: The product of `result` and `current_base` raised to the `remaining_exponent` equals the initial `a^N`.; `current_base` always represents `a` raised to the power of `2^k` for the current iteration `k`.
//   • Tips: Handle base cases like n=0 (result is 1) and n=1 (result is a).; Use long long or appropriate large integer types for intermediate products to prevent overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Integer overflow if not using appropriate data types or modulo arithmetic.; Incorrectly handling negative exponents (typically not covered by basic binary exponentiation).
// - Bit manipulation (number, counting)
//   • When to use: When you need to manipulate individual bits within an integer, optimize space, or perform fast operations on boolean flags or small sets. It's ideal for low-level control and specific integer property checks.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shifts. These operations allow for efficient setting, clearing, flipping, and checking of individual bits, typically with O(1) complexity per operation.
//   • Invariants: The state of any bit `i` where `i != x` is preserved during an operation on the `x`-th bit.; After `n = n | (1 << x)`, the `x`-th bit of `n` is 1.
//   • Tips: Use `1 << x` to create a mask for the x-th bit.; Understand the difference between `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>` operators.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect operator precedence (e.g., `&` vs `&&`).; Off-by-one errors with bit indices (0-indexed vs 1-indexed).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
