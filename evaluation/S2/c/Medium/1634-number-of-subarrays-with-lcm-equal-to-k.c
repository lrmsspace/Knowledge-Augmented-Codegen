//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of subarrays of nums where the least common multiple of the subarray's elements is k.
//
// A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
//
// The least common multiple of an array is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the array elements.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,6,2,7,1], k = 6
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The subarrays of nums where 6 is the least common multiple of all the subarray's elements are:
// - [3,6,2,7,1]
// - [3,6,2,7,1]
// - [3,6,2,7,1]
// - [3,6,2,7,1]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= nums[i], k <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer, typically by leveraging its prime factorization.
//   • Idea: The number of divisors d(n) and sum of divisors sigma(n) are arithmetic functions derived from the prime factorization of an integer n. Both can be computed efficiently by first finding prime factors and their exponents, resulting in an O(sqrt(N)) or O(log N) complexity with precomputed primes.
//   • Invariants: The current count of divisors is the product of (exponent + 1) for all prime factors found so far.; The current sum of divisors is the product of (1 + p + ... + p^e) for all prime factors found so far.
//   • Tips: Precompute primes using a sieve for efficiency when dealing with multiple queries or large numbers.; For sum of divisors, the formula is sigma(n) = product((1 + p_i + ... + p_i^e_i)) for each prime factor p_i^e_i.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle n=1 correctly, which has one divisor.; Integer overflow when calculating sums or products of large powers, especially for sum of divisors.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, prefix-sum, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compute modular inverses for multiple numbers in an array or a range, especially when efficiency is critical, by leveraging prefix and suffix products to reduce inverse computations.
//   • Idea: This technique efficiently computes modular inverses for multiple numbers by transforming individual inverse calculations into a product of prefix, suffix, and a single overall inverse. It achieves O(N + log M) complexity for an array or O(M) for a range.
//   • Invariants: For 0 <= i < N, prefix_products[i] holds (arr[0] * ... * arr[i-1]) % m.; For 0 <= i < N, suffix_products[i] holds (arr[i+1] * ... * arr[N-1]) % m.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix products and suffix products of the array elements modulo m.; Calculate the modular inverse of the total product of all elements once using modular exponentiation.
//   • Pitfalls: Ensure all numbers for which an inverse is sought are coprime to the modulus m.; Watch for off-by-one errors when calculating prefix and suffix product indices.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
