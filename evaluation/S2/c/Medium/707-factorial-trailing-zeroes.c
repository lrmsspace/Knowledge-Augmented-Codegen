// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.
//
// Note that n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3
// Output: 0
// Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= n <= 104
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Binary Exponentiation (number, mod-exp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently compute large integer powers of a number, especially when results need to be taken modulo a specific value. It is crucial for problems requiring powers with large exponents.
//   • Idea: Binary exponentiation, also known as exponentiation by squaring, computes a^n by breaking down the exponent n into its binary representation. This method significantly reduces the number of multiplications required, achieving an O(log n) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: In the iterative approach, (current_result * (original_base ^ original_exponent)) remains constant.; The exponent n is always non-negative and decreases towards zero.
//   • Tips: Apply the modulo operation at each multiplication step to prevent intermediate overflow.; The iterative approach is generally preferred over recursion to avoid potential stack overflow for very large exponents.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to apply modulo at each step can lead to integer overflow, especially with large bases.; Incorrectly handling the base case for n=0 or n=1.
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to efficiently calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer. It is applicable in number theory problems or combinatorial tasks involving factors.
//   • Idea: This method computes the number of divisors and sum of divisors of an integer n by first finding its prime factorization. The core idea leverages properties of multiplicative functions, with a typical complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for factorization.
//   • Invariants: During prime factorization, temp_n always holds the remaining unfactored part of the original number.; The current_prime_factor iterates through potential prime divisors in increasing order.
//   • Tips: First find the prime factorization n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak.; Number of divisors d(n) = (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the special case of n=1 (1 divisor, sum 1).; Incorrectly calculating powers or sums, especially for large exponents.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
