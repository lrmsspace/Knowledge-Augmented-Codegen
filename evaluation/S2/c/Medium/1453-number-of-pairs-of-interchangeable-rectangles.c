// Problem Description:
// You are given n rectangles represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array rectangles, where rectangles[i] = [widthi, heighti] denotes the width and height of the ith rectangle.
//
// Two rectangles i and j (i < j) are considered interchangeable if they have the same width-to-height ratio. More formally, two rectangles are interchangeable if widthi/heighti == widthj/heightj (using decimal division, not integer division).
//
// Return the number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles in rectangles.
//
// Example:
// Input: rectangles = [[4,8],[3,6],[10,20],[15,30]]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: The following are the interchangeable pairs of rectangles by index (0-indexed):
// - Rectangle 0 with rectangle 1: 4/8 == 3/6.
// - Rectangle 0 with rectangle 2: 4/8 == 10/20.
// - Rectangle 0 with rectangle 3: 4/8 == 15/30.
// - Rectangle 1 with rectangle 2: 3/6 == 10/20.
// - Rectangle 1 with rectangle 3: 3/6 == 15/30.
// - Rectangle 2 with rectangle 3: 10/20 == 15/30.
//
// Constraints:
// n == rectangles.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	rectangles[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= widthi, heighti <= 105

// - Lattice points inside non-lattice polygon (number, recursion, counting, gcd)
//   • When to use: Use when counting pairs or elements satisfying divisibility or GCD conditions. Also applicable for summing functions over pairs using number theory properties.
//   • Idea: This approach leverages number theoretic properties like GCD, LCM, and prime factorization to efficiently count elements or pairs satisfying specific criteria. It often involves iterating through divisors or multiples, achieving complexities like O(N log N) or O(sqrt N) per query.
//   • Invariants: All numbers processed so far have their relevant number-theoretic properties (e.g., prime factors, divisors) correctly determined.; The current count or sum accurately reflects all valid combinations found up to the current iteration.
//   • Tips: Precompute primes or divisors using a sieve for efficiency.; Utilize properties of GCD and LCM, such as gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b.
//   • Pitfalls: Overcounting or undercounting when using inclusion-exclusion.; Integer overflow with large products or sums.
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
