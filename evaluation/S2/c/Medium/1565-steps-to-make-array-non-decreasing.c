//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one step, remove all elements nums[i] where nums[i - 1] > nums[i] for all 0 < i < nums.length.
//
// Return the number of steps performed until nums becomes a non-decreasing array.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The following are the steps performed:
// - Step 1: [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11] becomes [5,4,4,7,6,11,11]
// - Step 2: [5,4,4,7,6,11,11] becomes [5,4,7,11,11]
// - Step 3: [5,4,7,11,11] becomes [5,7,11,11]
// [5,7,11,11] is a non-decreasing array. Therefore, we return 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
