//
// Problem Description:
// There are n dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.
//
// After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
//
// When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
//
// For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.
//
// You are given a string dominoes representing the initial state where:
//
//
// 	dominoes[i] = 'L', if the ith domino has been pushed to the left,
// 	dominoes[i] = 'R', if the ith domino has been pushed to the right, and
// 	dominoes[i] = '.', if the ith domino has not been pushed.
//
//
// Return a string representing the final state.
//
// Example:
// Input: dominoes = "RR.L"
// Output: "RR.L"
// Explanation: The first domino expends no additional force on the second domino.
//
// Constraints:
// n == dominoes.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	dominoes[i] is either 'L', 'R', or '.'.

// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring in a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity by leveraging symmetry.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all palindromic substrings in a string by expanding around centers and utilizing symmetry to avoid redundant comparisons. It achieves a linear time complexity of O(N) by maintaining the rightmost boundary of the longest palindrome found so far.
//   • Invariants: For any index k < i, d[k] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at k.; The pair (l, r) always represents the exclusive boundaries of the palindrome that extends furthest to the right among all processed centers.
//   • Tips: Pre-process the string with delimiters (e.g., '#') to uniformly handle both odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage symmetry: for a center 'i' within the current rightmost palindrome, its mirror 'j' provides a lower bound for the palindrome length at 'i'.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when the mirror palindrome extends beyond the current rightmost palindrome.; Forgetting to update the 'l' and 'r' boundaries after finding a new palindrome that extends further to the right.
// - Z-function and its calculation (string, array, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a pattern within a text, or to identify repeated prefixes within a string efficiently.
//   • Idea: The Z-function computes an array where each element z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the string and its suffix starting at index i. It runs in linear time, O(N), where N is the length of the string.
//   • Invariants: For all j < i, z[j] correctly stores the length of the longest common prefix between S and S[j...].; The segment [l, r-1] represents the rightmost segment that is a prefix of S and has been fully processed.
//   • Tips: Initialize z[0] to 0 (or N, depending on definition) and handle it as a base case.; Utilize previously computed Z-values to avoid redundant comparisons, especially within the 'rightmost matching segment' [l, r].
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating or using the 'rightmost matching segment' boundaries (l and r).; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices or lengths, especially with 0-based vs. 1-based indexing.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.

// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
