// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-select-buildings/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed binary string s which represents the types of buildings along a street where:
//
//
// 	s[i] = '0' denotes that the ith building is an office and
// 	s[i] = '1' denotes that the ith building is a restaurant.
//
//
// As a city official, you would like to select 3 buildings for random inspection. However, to ensure variety, no two consecutive buildings out of the selected buildings can be of the same type.
//
//
// 	For example, given s = "001101", we cannot select the 1st, 3rd, and 5th buildings as that would form "011" which is not allowed due to having two consecutive buildings of the same type.
//
//
// Return the number of valid ways to select 3 buildings.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "001101"
// Output: 6
// Explanation: 
// The following sets of indices selected are valid:
// - [0,2,4] from "001101" forms "010"
// - [0,3,4] from "001101" forms "010"
// - [1,2,4] from "001101" forms "010"
// - [1,3,4] from "001101" forms "010"
// - [2,4,5] from "001101" forms "101"
// - [3,4,5] from "001101" forms "101"
// No other selection is valid. Thus, there are 6 total ways.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
// - Z-function and its calculation (string, array, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a pattern within a text, or to identify repeated prefixes within a string efficiently.
//   • Idea: The Z-function computes an array where each element z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the string and its suffix starting at index i. It runs in linear time, O(N), where N is the length of the string.
//   • Invariants: For all j < i, z[j] correctly stores the length of the longest common prefix between S and S[j...].; The segment [l, r-1] represents the rightmost segment that is a prefix of S and has been fully processed.
//   • Tips: Initialize z[0] to 0 (or N, depending on definition) and handle it as a base case.; Utilize previously computed Z-values to avoid redundant comparisons, especially within the 'rightmost matching segment' [l, r].
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating or using the 'rightmost matching segment' boundaries (l and r).; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices or lengths, especially with 0-based vs. 1-based indexing.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
