//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.
//
// You can split string s into any list of non-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique.
//
// A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "ababccc"
// Output: 5
// Explanation: One way to split maximally is ['a', 'b', 'ab', 'c', 'cc']. Splitting like ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'cc'] is not valid as you have 'a' and 'b' multiple times.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 16
// 	
// 	
// 	s contains only lower case English letters.

// - Suffix Automaton (string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently process all substrings or suffixes of a given string, especially for counting distinct substrings, finding occurrences, or other complex string pattern problems. It provides linear time solutions for many tasks.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a directed acyclic graph that compactly represents all distinct substrings of a given string. It enables solving a wide range of string-related problems in linear time, typically O(N) or O(N log A) where N is string length and A is alphabet size.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the initial state corresponds to a distinct substring of the original string.; Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end positions.
//   • Tips: Understand the two types of links: suffix links (parent) and transition links (children).; Construction is typically incremental, adding characters one by one.
//   • Pitfalls: Implementation complexity is high; careful handling of state creation and link updates is crucial.; Off-by-one errors in length calculations or suffix link assignments are common.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
