// Problem Description:
// Given an array of strings queries and a string pattern, return a boolean array answer where answer[i] is true if queries[i] matches pattern, and false otherwise.
//
// A query word queries[i] matches pattern if you can insert lowercase English letters into the pattern so that it equals the query. You may insert a character at any position in pattern or you may choose not to insert any characters at all.
//
// Example:
// Input: queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FB"
// Output: [true,false,true,true,false]
// Explanation: "FooBar" can be generated like this "F" + "oo" + "B" + "ar".
// "FootBall" can be generated like this "F" + "oot" + "B" + "all".
// "FrameBuffer" can be generated like this "F" + "rame" + "B" + "uffer".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= pattern.length, queries.length <= 100
// 	1 <= queries[i].length <= 100
// 	queries[i] and pattern consist of English letters.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
// - Tries (trie, array, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing string keys in a symbol table and needing efficient prefix, wildcard, or longest prefix matching operations, offering flexibility beyond binary search trees and speed comparable to hashing.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where keys are typically strings. It allows for efficient retrieval of keys based on their prefixes, achieving O(L) time complexity for operations, where L is the key length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node exists only if it is part of at least one stored key.
//   • Tips: Choose an appropriate branching factor (R) based on the alphabet size.; Represent children using arrays for fixed alphabets or hash maps for sparse ones.
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or sparse data.; Deletion of keys can be complex, requiring careful handling of empty branches.
// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (trie, queue, bitset, aho-corasick, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when searching for multiple patterns simultaneously within a larger text. It is highly efficient for finding all occurrences of a dictionary of keywords.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a set of patterns, allowing efficient simultaneous searching for all patterns in a text. It typically achieves O(N + M + K) time complexity, where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: All patterns in the dictionary are correctly represented as paths in the trie structure.; For any state `s`, its failure link `fail[s]` points to the longest proper prefix of the string represented by `s` that is also a suffix of `s` and exists in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, representing each pattern as a path.; Use BFS to construct failure links, pointing to the longest proper prefix of the current state's string that is also a suffix.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; High memory usage if the pattern set is very large or patterns are excessively long.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
