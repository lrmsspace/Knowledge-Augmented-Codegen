// Problem Description:
// Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
// Output: [0,6]
// Explanation:
// The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
// The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104
// 	s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

// - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all palindromic substrings within a given string, or determine the longest palindromic substring, in optimal linear time.
//   • Idea: Manacher's Algorithm efficiently finds the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at each position in a given string, handling both odd and even lengths uniformly via preprocessing. It achieves this in optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: p[i] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at i in the transformed string.; The right_boundary always marks the rightmost extent of the largest palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with a unique delimiter to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage the mirror property around the current center to initialize palindrome radii.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when converting `p` array values back to original string indices or lengths.; Incorrectly handling the boundaries of the preprocessed string.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
