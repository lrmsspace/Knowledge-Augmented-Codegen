//
// Problem Description:
// Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
// Output: [2,2]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
// 	0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
//
//
//  
// Follow up:
//
//
// 	What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
// 	What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
// 	What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
// - Reservoir Sampling (array, randomized, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to randomly select a fixed number of items (k) from a stream or a very large dataset of unknown size, ensuring each item has an equal probability of selection in a single pass.
//   • Idea: Reservoir sampling is a randomized algorithm that selects k items from a list containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number, ensuring each item has an equal probability of being selected. It processes the input in a single pass with O(N) time complexity and O(k) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The reservoir always contains exactly k elements.; Any element processed up to the current index `i` has a k/(i+1) probability of being in the reservoir.
//   • Tips: Initialize the reservoir with the first k elements from the stream.; For each subsequent element, generate a random index from 0 to current_stream_index.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize the reservoir with the first k elements.; Generating random indices outside the valid range [0, current_stream_index] or [0, k-1].
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
