// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-maximum-number-of-string-pairs/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array words consisting of distinct strings.
//
// The string words[i] can be paired with the string words[j] if:
//
//
// 	The string words[i] is equal to the reversed string of words[j].
// 	0 <= i < j < words.length.
//
//
// Return the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the array words.
//
// Note that each string can belong in at most one pair.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["cd","ac","dc","ca","zz"]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: In this example, we can form 2 pair of strings in the following way:
// - We pair the 0th string with the 2nd string, as the reversed string of word[0] is "dc" and is equal to words[2].
// - We pair the 1st string with the 3rd string, as the reversed string of word[1] is "ca" and is equal to words[3].
// It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 50
// 	words[i].length == 2
// 	words consists of distinct strings.
// 	words[i] contains only lowercase English letters.

// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring in a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity by leveraging symmetry.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all palindromic substrings in a string by expanding around centers and utilizing symmetry to avoid redundant comparisons. It achieves a linear time complexity of O(N) by maintaining the rightmost boundary of the longest palindrome found so far.
//   • Invariants: For any index k < i, d[k] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at k.; The pair (l, r) always represents the exclusive boundaries of the palindrome that extends furthest to the right among all processed centers.
//   • Tips: Pre-process the string with delimiters (e.g., '#') to uniformly handle both odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage symmetry: for a center 'i' within the current rightmost palindrome, its mirror 'j' provides a lower bound for the palindrome length at 'i'.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when the mirror palindrome extends beyond the current rightmost palindrome.; Forgetting to update the 'l' and 'r' boundaries after finding a new palindrome that extends further to the right.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Suffix array (array, string, suffix-array, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use suffix arrays for efficient string processing tasks like finding all occurrences of a pattern, locating the longest common substring, or performing various substring queries. It provides a sorted index of all suffixes.
//   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing their starting indices in lexicographical order. It enables various string operations to be performed efficiently, often with O(N log N) or O(N) time complexity for construction and O(M log N) or O(M) for queries.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array A always contains N elements, where N is the length of the original string.; For any valid index i, A[i] stores a starting position within the original string S.
//   • Tips: Append a unique sentinel character (e.g., '$') to the string to ensure all suffixes are distinct.; Combine with a Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array for enhanced functionality, such as counting distinct substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive construction by sorting all suffixes directly is inefficient (O(N^2 log N) or worse).; Implementing advanced construction algorithms from scratch can be complex and error-prone.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
