// Problem Description:
// Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
//
// In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:
//
// Example:
// Input: numRows = 5
// Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= numRows <= 30
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Binomial Coefficients (number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to calculate multiple binomial coefficients or when a single coefficient is required and N and K are not excessively large, allowing for table precomputation.
//   • Idea: This method computes binomial coefficients C(n, k) using Pascal's recurrence relation C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k), typically building a table. It has a time complexity of O(N*K) or O(N^2) for building the full triangle up to N.
//   • Invariants: C[i][0] is always 1 for any row i.; C[i][i] is always 1 for any row i.
//   • Tips: Intermediate results for Pascal's Triangle never exceed the final answer, simplifying overflow checks if not using modular arithmetic.; Each new table element requires only one addition, making it computationally efficient per element.
//   • Pitfalls: Building the entire Pascal's Triangle for a single C(N, K) can be slow for large N and K, as it computes many unnecessary values.; Directly computing C(N, K) using factorials can lead to overflow issues for large N, even if the final result fits.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
