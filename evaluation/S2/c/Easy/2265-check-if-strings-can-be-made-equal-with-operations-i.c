//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length 4, consisting of lowercase English letters.
//
// You can apply the following operation on any of the two strings any number of times:
//
//
// 	Choose any two indices i and j such that j - i = 2, then swap the two characters at those indices in the string.
//
//
// Return true if you can make the strings s1 and s2 equal, and false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"
// Output: true
// Explanation: We can do the following operations on s1:
// - Choose the indices i = 0, j = 2. The resulting string is s1 = "cbad".
// - Choose the indices i = 1, j = 3. The resulting string is s1 = "cdab" = s2.
//
// Constraints:
// s1.length == s2.length == 4
// 	s1 and s2 consist only of lowercase English letters.

// - Check if two segments intersect (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this when determining if two line segments in a 2D plane share any common points, especially when floating-point precision issues need to be avoided.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect by handling collinear and non-collinear cases separately, primarily using integer arithmetic to avoid precision errors. It typically runs in O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: If segments are collinear, their 1D projections on both axes must overlap for intersection.; If segments are not collinear, each segment's endpoints must lie on opposite sides of the line containing the other segment.
//   • Tips: Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.; Utilize cross products for efficient orientation checks.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly identify and handle collinear segments.; Introducing floating-point errors by using division for slopes.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
//   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
//   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

bool canBeEqual(char* s1, char* s2) {
    int count[26] = {0}; // Count of each character in s1 and s2

    // Count characters in s1
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        count[s1[i] - 'a']++;
    }

    // Subtract counts based on characters in s2
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        count[s2[i] - 'a']--;

    // Check if all counts are zero
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (count[i] != 0) {
            return false; // If any count is not zero, s1 and s2 cannot be made equal
        }
    }

    return true; // All counts are zero, s1 and s2 can be made equal
