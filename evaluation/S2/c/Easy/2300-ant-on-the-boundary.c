//
// Problem Description:
// An ant is on a boundary. It sometimes goes left and sometimes right.
//
// You are given an array of non-zero integers nums. The ant starts reading nums from the first element of it to its end. At each step, it moves according to the value of the current element:
//
//
// 	If nums[i] < 0, it moves left by -nums[i] units.
// 	If nums[i] > 0, it moves right by nums[i] units.
//
//
// Return the number of times the ant returns to the boundary.
//
// Notes:
//
//
// 	There is an infinite space on both sides of the boundary.
// 	We check whether the ant is on the boundary only after it has moved |nums[i]| units. In other words, if the ant crosses the boundary during its movement, it does not count.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,3,-5]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: After the first step, the ant is 2 steps to the right of the boundary.
// After the second step, the ant is 5 steps to the right of the boundary.
// After the third step, the ant is on the boundary.
// So the answer is 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
// 	nums[i] != 0
//

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When you need to calculate the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in sequential order. It efficiently handles both convex and non-convex polygons.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing the signed areas of trapezoids or triangles formed by its edges and a reference point/axis. It achieves O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sum accumulates the signed area contribution of processed edges.; The current vertex and the next vertex define an edge of the polygon.
//   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in sequential order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; The absolute value of the final result is the polygon's area.
//   • Pitfalls: Supplying vertices in a non-sequential or arbitrary order will yield an incorrect area.; Applying the formula to self-intersecting polygons will not give the true geometric area.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

int returnToBoundaryCount(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    int position = 0; // Current position of the ant
    int count = 0;    // Count of returns to the boundary

    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        position += nums[i]; // Move the ant according to the current element

        // Check if the ant is back on the boundary
        if (position == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
