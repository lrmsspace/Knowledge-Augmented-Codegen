// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers nums, half of the integers in nums are odd, and the other half are even.
//
// Sort the array so that whenever nums[i] is odd, i is odd, and whenever nums[i] is even, i is even.
//
// Return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [4,2,5,7]
// Output: [4,5,2,7]
// Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
// 	nums.length is even.
// 	Half of the integers in nums are even.
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
//

// - bucket-sort (array, bucket-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting elements with a known, uniform distribution over a specific range. It is efficient for numbers that are uniformly distributed across a range, often achieving linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates them. It can achieve O(N+K) average time complexity for uniformly distributed data.
//   • Invariants: After distributing elements, each element `x` is in bucket `floor(N * x)`.; After sorting buckets, every bucket `buckets[i]` contains its elements in sorted order.
//   • Tips: Choose the number of buckets appropriately based on data distribution and range.; Normalize input data to a [0, 1) range for simpler bucket indexing.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor performance with non-uniform data distribution, potentially degrading to O(N^2).; Requires extra space for the buckets, proportional to N+K.
// - Check whether a graph is bipartite (graph, queue, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to determine if an undirected graph can be divided into two independent sets such that all edges connect vertices from different sets, or if it is two-colorable.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if an undirected graph is bipartite by attempting to 2-color it using BFS. It assigns alternating colors (or sets) to adjacent vertices, detecting non-bipartite conditions if an edge connects two vertices of the same color.
//   • Invariants: All visited vertices within the current BFS component are correctly 2-colored.; All edges processed so far connect vertices of different colors.
//   • Tips: Use two distinct colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to represent the two sets.; Iterate through all vertices and start a new BFS from any unvisited vertex to handle disconnected components.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected graphs by ensuring all vertices are visited.; Incorrectly assigning colors, leading to false positives or negatives.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
//   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
//   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
