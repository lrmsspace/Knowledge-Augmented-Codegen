//
// Problem Description:
// Given a positive integer num, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to num whose digit sums are even.
//
// The digit sum of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.
//
// Example:
// Input: num = 4
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= num <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Integration by Simpson's formula (number, interval, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when approximating definite integrals of functions that are sufficiently smooth over a given interval. It is effective for achieving good accuracy with a moderate number of subintervals.
//   • Idea: Simpson's formula approximates a definite integral by dividing the integration interval into an even number of subintervals and approximating the function over each pair of subintervals with a parabola. This method offers a higher order of accuracy compared to simpler rules, typically achieving O(N^4) accuracy for N subintervals.
//   • Invariants: The sum accumulates weighted function values for all processed subintervals.; The subinterval width 'h' remains constant across the entire integration range.
//   • Tips: Ensure the total number of subintervals (2n) is always even for the composite rule.; The weights for function evaluations follow a specific 1-4-2-4-...-2-4-1 pattern.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the weighting coefficients, especially at the boundaries or interior points.; Using an odd number of subintervals, which invalidates the parabolic approximation for the composite rule.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
