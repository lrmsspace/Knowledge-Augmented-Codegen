// Problem Description:
// A square triple (a,b,c) is a triple where a, b, and c are integers and a2 + b2 = c2.
//
// Given an integer n, return the number of square triples such that 1 <= a, b, c <= n.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5) and (4,3,5).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 250
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Sqrt Tree (array, number, bitmask-dp, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Used for answering range queries on a static array by recursively decomposing it into square root sized blocks, achieving O(log log N) query time.
//   • Idea: A Sqrt Tree is a recursive data structure that decomposes an array into blocks of square root size, building a similar structure on each block. It allows for efficient range queries, typically achieving O(log log N) query time after an O(N log log N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the Sqrt Tree represents a contiguous segment of the original array.; A node representing a segment of length k has sqrt(k) children, each covering a block of sqrt(k) elements.
//   • Tips: Precompute answers for all possible block combinations within a node.; Handle queries spanning multiple blocks by combining precomputed prefix, suffix, and full block results.
//   • Pitfalls: High constant factors due to complex precomputation per node.; Memory usage can be significant, O(N log log N), for large N.
// - Lattice points inside non-lattice polygon (number, recursion, counting, gcd)
//   • When to use: Use when counting pairs or elements satisfying divisibility or GCD conditions. Also applicable for summing functions over pairs using number theory properties.
//   • Idea: This approach leverages number theoretic properties like GCD, LCM, and prime factorization to efficiently count elements or pairs satisfying specific criteria. It often involves iterating through divisors or multiples, achieving complexities like O(N log N) or O(sqrt N) per query.
//   • Invariants: All numbers processed so far have their relevant number-theoretic properties (e.g., prime factors, divisors) correctly determined.; The current count or sum accurately reflects all valid combinations found up to the current iteration.
//   • Tips: Precompute primes or divisors using a sieve for efficiency.; Utilize properties of GCD and LCM, such as gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b.
//   • Pitfalls: Overcounting or undercounting when using inclusion-exclusion.; Integer overflow with large products or sums.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
