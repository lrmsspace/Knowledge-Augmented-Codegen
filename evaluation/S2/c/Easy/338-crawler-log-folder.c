// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.
//
// The operations are described below:
//
//
// 	"../" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
// 	"./" : Remain in the same folder.
// 	"x/" : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).
//
//
// You are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the user at the ith step.
//
// The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in logs are performed.
//
// Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.
//
// Example:
// Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= logs.length <= 103
// 	2 <= logs[i].length <= 10
// 	logs[i] contains lowercase English letters, digits, '.', and '/'.
// 	logs[i] follows the format described in the statement.
// 	Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this when verifying if a sequence of delimiters is correctly nested and balanced. It is also applicable for counting or generating all possible valid sequences of a given length.
//   • Idea: This algorithm involves checking if a sequence of opening and closing delimiters is properly matched and nested, or enumerating such sequences. Validation typically uses a stack in O(N) time, while generation often involves backtracking with O(Catalan(N)) complexity.
//   • Invariants: The stack contains only opening delimiters that are yet to be matched.; The balance counter (open - close) is never negative at any point during traversal.
//   • Tips: Use a stack to track unmatched opening delimiters for validation.; Maintain a balance counter (increment for open, decrement for close) for a simpler check.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if the stack is empty after processing the entire sequence.; Allowing a closing delimiter when no matching opening delimiter is available (empty stack or mismatch).
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It is applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered selections from a sequence.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or with a greedy approach using binary search in O(N log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or equivalent) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index `i`, `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1` found so far.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains a 'tails' array where tails[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Use binary search (specifically `lower_bound` for strictly increasing) to find the correct position to update the 'tails' array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray; elements do not need to be contiguous.; Incorrectly applying binary search (e.g., using `upper_bound` instead of `lower_bound` for strict increase).
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (array, min-window)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree efficiently for multiple queries. This approach is ideal when the tree is static and preprocessing is acceptable.
//   • Idea: This method finds the LCA by converting the problem into a Range Minimum Query on an Euler tour of the tree's depths. It preprocesses the tree in O(N log N) or O(N) time and answers queries in O(log N) or O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour array correctly records nodes in DFS entry/exit order.; The depth array stores the correct depth for each node in the Euler tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a DFS to construct the Euler tour and depth array.; Store the first occurrence index of each node in the Euler tour.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly constructing the Euler tour or depth array.; Off-by-one errors when mapping Euler tour indices to original nodes.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
