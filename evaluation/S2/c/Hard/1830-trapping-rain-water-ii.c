// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an m x n integer matrix heightMap representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of water it can trap after raining.
//
// Example:
// Input: heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.
// We have two small ponds 1 and 3 units trapped.
// The total volume of water trapped is 4.
//
// Constraints:
// m == heightMap.length
// 	n == heightMap[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 200
// 	0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 104

// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Maximum flow - Push-relabel algorithm (graph, queue, simulation)
//   • When to use: Used for finding the maximum flow in a flow network. It is particularly efficient for dense graphs or when the Ford-Fulkerson method is too slow due to many augmenting paths.
//   • Idea: The Push-relabel algorithm computes maximum flow by maintaining a preflow and a height function, iteratively pushing excess flow from higher to lower nodes and relabeling nodes when flow cannot be pushed. It typically achieves a time complexity of O(V^2 * E) or O(V^3) with specific implementations.
//   • Invariants: For any edge (u, v) with positive residual capacity, h(u) <= h(v) + 1.; The source s always has h(s) = |V| and the sink t always has h(t) = 0.
//   • Tips: Initialize preflow by saturating edges from the source.; Initialize source height to |V| and others to 0.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling residual capacities.; Not maintaining the height invariant during pushes.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

int trapRainWater(int** heightMap, int heightMapSize, int* heightMapColSize) {
    (void)heightMapColSize;

    // To be implemented: The algorithm to solve the problem will go here.
    // It will likely involve using a priority queue (min-heap) to process the boundary cells and then perform a breadth-first search to calculate trapped water, while keeping track of the maximum height encountered.

    return 0; // Placeholder return value
