// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reconstruct-a-tree/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array pairs, where pairs[i] = [xi, yi], and:
//
//
// 	There are no duplicates.
// 	xi < yi
//
//
// Let ways be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:
//
//
// 	The tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in pairs.
// 	A pair [xi, yi] exists in pairs if and only if xi is an ancestor of yi or yi is an ancestor of xi.
// 	Note: the tree does not have to be a binary tree.
//
//
// Two ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.
//
// Return:
//
//
// 	0 if ways == 0
// 	1 if ways == 1
// 	2 if ways > 1
//
//
// A rooted tree is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.
//
// An ancestor of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.
//
// Example:
// Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3]]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: There is exactly one valid rooted tree, which is shown in the above figure.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= pairs.length <= 105
// 	1 <= xi < yi <= 500
// 	The elements in pairs are unique.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (array, min-window)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree efficiently for multiple queries. This approach is ideal when the tree is static and preprocessing is acceptable.
//   • Idea: This method finds the LCA by converting the problem into a Range Minimum Query on an Euler tour of the tree's depths. It preprocesses the tree in O(N log N) or O(N) time and answers queries in O(log N) or O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour array correctly records nodes in DFS entry/exit order.; The depth array stores the correct depth for each node in the Euler tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a DFS to construct the Euler tour and depth array.; Store the first occurrence index of each node in the Euler tour.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly constructing the Euler tour or depth array.; Off-by-one errors when mapping Euler tour indices to original nodes.
// - Second Best Minimum Spanning Tree (graph, tree, mst-kruskal, lca, binary-lifting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a spanning tree with the second smallest total edge weight, typically after finding the primary Minimum Spanning Tree.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the second best Minimum Spanning Tree by iterating through non-MST edges, adding each to the MST to form a cycle, and then removing the maximum weight edge on that cycle (excluding the added edge). It leverages Kruskal's for the initial MST and LCA with binary lifting for efficient path maximum queries, achieving an overall time complexity of O(E log E + E log V).
//   • Invariants: The initial MST is always a valid spanning tree with minimum total weight.; For any non-MST edge (u, v) added, a unique cycle is formed in the current graph.
//   • Tips: Precompute LCA and maximum edge weights on paths using binary lifting for efficiency.; The initial MST can be found using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the maximum weight edge on the cycle when adding a non-MST edge.; Forgetting to exclude the newly added edge itself when finding the maximum edge on the cycle.
// - Finding Bridges Online (graph, tree, union-find, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to dynamically track bridges and 2-edge-connected components in a graph as edges are added. It efficiently updates the graph structure and bridge count in an online fashion.
//   • Idea: This algorithm maintains 2-edge-connected components and bridges in a graph as edges are added, using a Union-Find structure to manage components and a forest to represent the relationships between them. It typically achieves near-amortized constant time per edge addition.
//   • Invariants: Each 2-edge-connected component is represented by a single root in the Union-Find structure.; The set of bridges forms a forest where each node is a 2-edge-connected component.
//   • Tips: Represent 2-edge-connected components using Union-Find for efficient merging.; Maintain a forest where nodes are 2-edge-connected components and edges are bridges.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying when an edge forms a cycle with existing bridges.; Failing to update the bridge count accurately when bridges are removed.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
