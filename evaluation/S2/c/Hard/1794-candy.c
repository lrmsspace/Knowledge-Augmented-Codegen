// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
//
// You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
//
//
// 	Each child must have at least one candy.
// 	Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.
//
// Example:
// Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
//
// Constraints:
// n == ratings.length
// 	1 <= n <= 2 * 104
// 	0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104
//

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It provides logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that can efficiently update individual elements and calculate prefix sums in an array. Both operations are performed in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each `tree[i]` element stores the sum of a contiguous range of elements from the original array, specifically from `i - (i & -i) + 1` to `i` (inclusive, 1-based).; After any `update(idx, val)` operation, `query(idx)` will reflect the new sum up to `idx`.
//   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for array elements to simplify bitwise logic; The `idx & -idx` operation is key to navigating the implicit tree structure
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-based and 1-based indexing can lead to incorrect results; Off-by-one errors when calculating range sums (e.g., `query(R) - query(L-1)`)
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
