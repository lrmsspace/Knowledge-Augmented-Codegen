// Problem Description:
// Let f(x) be the number of zeroes at the end of x!. Recall that x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x and by convention, 0! = 1.
//
//
// 	For example, f(3) = 0 because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while f(11) = 2 because 11! = 39916800 has two zeroes at the end.
//
//
// Given an integer k, return the number of non-negative integers x have the property that f(x) = k.
//
// Example:
// Input: k = 0
// Output: 5
// Explanation: 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with k = 0 zeroes.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= k <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Factorial modulo 
// p (number, array, recursion, mod-exp, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when computing powers of numbers modulo another number, especially with very large exponents, to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.
//   • Idea: Modular exponentiation computes the remainder of a large positive integer power divided by another positive integer. It runs in O(log exponent) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The current result `res` accumulates the product of `base` terms modulo `modulus`.; The `exponent` variable always represents the remaining power to be applied.
//   • Tips: Use binary exponentiation (exponentiation by squaring) for efficiency.; Handle base, exponent, and modulus carefully for edge cases like zero or one.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to apply modulo at each step, leading to overflow.; Incorrectly handling negative exponents (if applicable, though usually positive).
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    // The number of trailing zeroes in x! is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to x.
