// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-build-rooms-in-an-ant-colony/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are an ant tasked with adding n new rooms numbered 0 to n-1 to your colony. You are given the expansion plan as a 0-indexed integer array of length n, prevRoom, where prevRoom[i] indicates that you must build room prevRoom[i] before building room i, and these two rooms must be connected directly. Room 0 is already built, so prevRoom[0] = -1. The expansion plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be reachable from room 0.
//
// You can only build one room at a time, and you can travel freely between rooms you have already built only if they are connected. You can choose to build any room as long as its previous room is already built.
//
// Return the number of different orders you can build all the rooms in. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: prevRoom = [-1,0,1]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: There is only one way to build the additional rooms: 0 → 1 → 2
//
// Constraints:
// n == prevRoom.length
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	prevRoom[0] == -1
// 	0 <= prevRoom[i] < n for all 1 <= i < n
// 	Every room is reachable from room 0 once all the rooms are built.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Factorial modulo 
// p (number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total count of possibilities or arrangements that can be naturally broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems. It's effective for exploring decision trees or state spaces.
//   • Idea: Counting determines the number of elements or event occurrences. It uses combinatorial or iterative/recursive methods, often with O(N) or O(log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each recursive call processes a smaller, well-defined subproblem.; The base cases correctly return the count for the simplest scenarios.
//   • Tips: Identify the smallest subproblem and its base cases to stop recursion.; Define the recursive relation clearly, showing how larger problems depend on smaller ones.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect results.; Overlapping subproblems without memoization can lead to exponential time complexity.
// - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, prefix-sum, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compute modular inverses for multiple numbers in an array or a range, especially when efficiency is critical, by leveraging prefix and suffix products to reduce inverse computations.
//   • Idea: This technique efficiently computes modular inverses for multiple numbers by transforming individual inverse calculations into a product of prefix, suffix, and a single overall inverse. It achieves O(N + log M) complexity for an array or O(M) for a range.
//   • Invariants: For 0 <= i < N, prefix_products[i] holds (arr[0] * ... * arr[i-1]) % m.; For 0 <= i < N, suffix_products[i] holds (arr[i+1] * ... * arr[N-1]) % m.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix products and suffix products of the array elements modulo m.; Calculate the modular inverse of the total product of all elements once using modular exponentiation.
//   • Pitfalls: Ensure all numbers for which an inverse is sought are coprime to the modulus m.; Watch for off-by-one errors when calculating prefix and suffix product indices.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
