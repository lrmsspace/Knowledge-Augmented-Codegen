// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-good-subsets/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums. We call a subset of nums good if its product can be represented as a product of one or more distinct prime numbers.
//
//
// 	For example, if nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]:
//
// 	
// 		[2, 3], [1, 2, 3], and [1, 3] are good subsets with products 6 = 2*3, 6 = 2*3, and 3 = 3 respectively.
// 		[1, 4] and [4] are not good subsets with products 4 = 2*2 and 4 = 2*2 respectively.
// 	
// 	
//
//
// Return the number of different good subsets in nums modulo 109 + 7.
//
// A subset of nums is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from nums. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: The good subsets are:
// - [1,2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
// - [1,2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
// - [1,3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
// - [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
// - [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
// - [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 30
//

// - Binomial Coefficients (array, number, dp-1d, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating binomial coefficients C(n, k) modulo a composite number M, especially when M is not prime and direct modular inverse computation for factorials is not possible.
//   • Idea: This technique computes binomial coefficients modulo an arbitrary composite number M by factoring M into prime powers. For each prime power, it calculates prime exponents in factorials and combines coprime parts, then uses Chinese Remainder Theorem.
//   • Invariants: For any `i <= N`, `c[i]` correctly stores the exponent of prime `p` in `i!`.; For any `i <= N`, `g[i]` correctly stores `(i! / p^c[i]) % (p^b)`.
//   • Tips: Precompute factorials and their prime exponents up to N using dynamic programming.; Apply Legendre's formula to efficiently find the exponent of a prime 'p' in 'x!'.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly factorize the modulus 'M' into its prime power components.; Incorrectly computing modular inverses when a number is not coprime to the modulus.
// - Factorial modulo 
// p (number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total count of possibilities or arrangements that can be naturally broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems. It's effective for exploring decision trees or state spaces.
//   • Idea: Counting determines the number of elements or event occurrences. It uses combinatorial or iterative/recursive methods, often with O(N) or O(log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each recursive call processes a smaller, well-defined subproblem.; The base cases correctly return the count for the simplest scenarios.
//   • Tips: Identify the smallest subproblem and its base cases to stop recursion.; Define the recursive relation clearly, showing how larger problems depend on smaller ones.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect results.; Overlapping subproblems without memoization can lead to exponential time complexity.
// - Euler's totient function
//  (array, number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. It is also efficient for computing totient values for all numbers in a given range.
//   • Idea: Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. It can be computed for a single n in O(sqrt(n)) using prime factorization, or for all numbers up to N in O(N log log N) using a sieve-like algorithm.
//   • Invariants: phi[i] stores the current totient value for i, which is i initially, then updated by (1 - 1/p) for each prime p dividing i.; After iterating through all primes p up to sqrt(N), phi[i] holds the correct totient value for all i <= N.
//   • Tips: For a single n, compute φ(n) using its prime factorization.; For all φ(i) up to N, use a sieve approach similar to Sieve of Eratosthenes.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 'relatively prime' with 'prime number'.; Applying the multiplicative property incorrectly when numbers share common factors.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
