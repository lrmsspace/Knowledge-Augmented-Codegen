// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-k-reducible-numbers-less-than-n/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a binary string s representing a number n in its binary form.
//
// You are also given an integer k.
//
// An integer x is called k-reducible if performing the following operation at most k times reduces it to 1:
//
//
// 	Replace x with the count of set bits in its binary representation.
//
//
// For example, the binary representation of 6 is "110". Applying the operation once reduces it to 2 (since "110" has two set bits). Applying the operation again to 2 (binary "10") reduces it to 1 (since "10" has one set bit).
//
// Return an integer denoting the number of positive integers less than n that are k-reducible.
//
// Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "111", k = 1
//
// Output: 3
//
// Explanation: 
//
// n = 7. The 1-reducible integers less than 7 are 1, 2, and 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 800
// 	s has no leading zeros.
// 	s consists only of the characters '0' and '1'.
// 	1 <= k <= 5
//

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Factorial modulo 
// p (number, array, recursion, mod-exp, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when computing powers of numbers modulo another number, especially with very large exponents, to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.
//   • Idea: Modular exponentiation computes the remainder of a large positive integer power divided by another positive integer. It runs in O(log exponent) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The current result `res` accumulates the product of `base` terms modulo `modulus`.; The `exponent` variable always represents the remaining power to be applied.
//   • Tips: Use binary exponentiation (exponentiation by squaring) for efficiency.; Handle base, exponent, and modulus carefully for edge cases like zero or one.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to apply modulo at each step, leading to overflow.; Incorrectly handling negative exponents (if applicable, though usually positive).
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
