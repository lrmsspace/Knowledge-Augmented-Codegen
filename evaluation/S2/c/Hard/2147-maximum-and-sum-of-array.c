//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer numSlots such that 2 * numSlots >= n. There are numSlots slots numbered from 1 to numSlots.
//
// You have to place all n integers into the slots such that each slot contains at most two numbers. The AND sum of a given placement is the sum of the bitwise AND of every number with its respective slot number.
//
//
// 	For example, the AND sum of placing the numbers [1, 3] into slot 1 and [4, 6] into slot 2 is equal to (1 AND 1) + (3 AND 1) + (4 AND 2) + (6 AND 2) = 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 4.
//
//
// Return the maximum possible AND sum of nums given numSlots slots.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], numSlots = 3
// Output: 9
// Explanation: One possible placement is [1, 4] into slot 1, [2, 6] into slot 2, and [3, 5] into slot 3. 
// This gives the maximum AND sum of (1 AND 1) + (4 AND 1) + (2 AND 2) + (6 AND 2) + (3 AND 3) + (5 AND 3) = 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	1 <= numSlots <= 9
// 	1 <= n <= 2 * numSlots
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 15
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, sparse-table, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to perform O(1) range queries on a static array for an associative operation, after an O(N log N) preprocessing step.
//   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries using an associative operation on a static array. It achieves O(1) query time and O(N log N) build time by storing prefix-like sums within logarithmically sized blocks.
//   • Invariants: For each level k, the array is partitioned into 2^k segments.; Within each segment, table[k][j] stores the result of the associative operation from j to the segment's midpoint (or midpoint to j).
//   • Tips: Ensure the operation is associative (e.g., min, max, sum, gcd, bitwise operations).; Preprocessing takes O(N log N) time and space.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for mutable arrays; updates require rebuilding the table.; Requires O(N log N) memory, which can be substantial for very large N.
// - Bit manipulation (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when operations on individual bits of an integer are required, for optimizing arithmetic with powers of two, or for efficient management of boolean flags.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators and shifts. These operations typically have O(1) time complexity as they are hardware-level instructions.
//   • Invariants: The total number of bits representing the integer remains constant for fixed-width types.; Applying `n & (1 << k)` isolates the k-th bit, setting all other bits to zero.
//   • Tips: Use `&` with `(1 << k)` to check if the k-th bit is set.; Use `|` with `(1 << k)` to set the k-th bit.
//   • Pitfalls: Be aware of integer overflow when performing large left shifts.; Understand the difference between arithmetic and logical right shifts, especially for signed numbers.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
