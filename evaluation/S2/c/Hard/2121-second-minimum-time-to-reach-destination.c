// Problem Description:
// A city is represented as a bi-directional connected graph with n vertices where each vertex is labeled from 1 to n (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is time minutes.
//
// Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every change minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.
//
// The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value.
//
//
// 	For example the second minimum value of [2, 3, 4] is 3, and the second minimum value of [2, 2, 4] is 4.
//
//
// Given n, edges, time, and change, return the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex 1 to vertex n.
//
// Notes:
//
//
// 	You can go through any vertex any number of times, including 1 and n.
// 	You can assume that when the journey starts, all signals have just turned green.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[3,4],[4,5]], time = 3, change = 5
// Output: 13
// Explanation:
// The figure on the left shows the given graph.
// The blue path in the figure on the right is the minimum time path.
// The time taken is:
// - Start at 1, time elapsed=0
// - 1 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
// - 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
// Hence the minimum time needed is 6 minutes.
//
// The red path shows the path to get the second minimum time.
// - Start at 1, time elapsed=0
// - 1 -> 3: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
// - 3 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
// - Wait at 4 for 4 minutes, time elapsed=10
// - 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=13
// Hence the second minimum time is 13 minutes.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 104
// 	n - 1 <= edges.length <= min(2 * 104, n * (n - 1) / 2)
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= ui, vi <= n
// 	ui != vi
// 	There are no duplicate edges.
// 	Each vertex can be reached directly or indirectly from every other vertex.
// 	1 <= time, change <= 103

// - Second Best Minimum Spanning Tree (graph, tree, mst-kruskal, lca, binary-lifting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a spanning tree with the second smallest total edge weight, typically after finding the primary Minimum Spanning Tree.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the second best Minimum Spanning Tree by iterating through non-MST edges, adding each to the MST to form a cycle, and then removing the maximum weight edge on that cycle (excluding the added edge). It leverages Kruskal's for the initial MST and LCA with binary lifting for efficient path maximum queries, achieving an overall time complexity of O(E log E + E log V).
//   • Invariants: The initial MST is always a valid spanning tree with minimum total weight.; For any non-MST edge (u, v) added, a unique cycle is formed in the current graph.
//   • Tips: Precompute LCA and maximum edge weights on paths using binary lifting for efficiency.; The initial MST can be found using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the maximum weight edge on the cycle when adding a non-MST edge.; Forgetting to exclude the newly added edge itself when finding the maximum edge on the cycle.
// - Check whether a graph is bipartite (graph, queue, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to determine if an undirected graph can be divided into two independent sets such that all edges connect vertices from different sets, or if it is two-colorable.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if an undirected graph is bipartite by attempting to 2-color it using BFS. It assigns alternating colors (or sets) to adjacent vertices, detecting non-bipartite conditions if an edge connects two vertices of the same color.
//   • Invariants: All visited vertices within the current BFS component are correctly 2-colored.; All edges processed so far connect vertices of different colors.
//   • Tips: Use two distinct colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to represent the two sets.; Iterate through all vertices and start a new BFS from any unvisited vertex to handle disconnected components.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected graphs by ensuring all vertices are visited.; Incorrectly assigning colors, leading to false positives or negatives.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
