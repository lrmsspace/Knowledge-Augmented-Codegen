// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/total-characters-in-string-after-transformations-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, an integer t representing the number of transformations to perform, and an array nums of size 26. In one transformation, every character in s is replaced according to the following rules:
//
//
// 	Replace s[i] with the next nums[s[i] - 'a'] consecutive characters in the alphabet. For example, if s[i] = 'a' and nums[0] = 3, the character 'a' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in "bcd".
// 	The transformation wraps around the alphabet if it exceeds 'z'. For example, if s[i] = 'y' and nums[24] = 3, the character 'y' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in "zab".
//
//
// Return the length of the resulting string after exactly t transformations.
//
// Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]
//
// Output: 7
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	
// 	First Transformation (t = 1):
//
// 	
// 		'a' becomes 'b' as nums[0] == 1
// 		'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
// 		'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
// 		'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
// 		'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
// 		String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
// 	
// 	
// 	
// 	Second Transformation (t = 2):
//
// 	
// 		'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
// 		'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
// 		'd' becomes 'e' as nums[3] == 1
// 		'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
// 		'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
// 		String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
// 	
// 	
// 	
// 	Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s consists only of lowercase English letters.
// 	1 <= t <= 109
// 	nums.length == 26
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 25

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare strings, find duplicate strings, or perform fast substring searches and pattern matching in O(1) time after initial O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to a numerical value using a polynomial function, enabling O(1) comparison of strings or substrings after O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: prefix_hash[i] stores the polynomial hash of the substring s[0...i-1].; p_power[k] stores p^k mod m for efficient calculation.
//   • Tips: Use two different hash functions with distinct prime `p` and `m` values to minimize collision probability.; Precompute powers of `p` and prefix hashes to enable O(1) substring hash calculation.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions can lead to incorrect results; always consider their possibility.; Integer overflow if modulo operations are not applied correctly at each step of calculation.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Factorial modulo 
// p (number, array, recursion, mod-exp, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when computing powers of numbers modulo another number, especially with very large exponents, to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.
//   • Idea: Modular exponentiation computes the remainder of a large positive integer power divided by another positive integer. It runs in O(log exponent) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The current result `res` accumulates the product of `base` terms modulo `modulus`.; The `exponent` variable always represents the remaining power to be applied.
//   • Tips: Use binary exponentiation (exponentiation by squaring) for efficiency.; Handle base, exponent, and modulus carefully for edge cases like zero or one.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to apply modulo at each step, leading to overflow.; Incorrectly handling negative exponents (if applicable, though usually positive).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
