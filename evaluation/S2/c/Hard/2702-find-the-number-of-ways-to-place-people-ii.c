//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D array points of size n x 2 representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
//
// We define the right direction as positive x-axis (increasing x-coordinate) and the left direction as negative x-axis (decreasing x-coordinate). Similarly, we define the up direction as positive y-axis (increasing y-coordinate) and the down direction as negative y-axis (decreasing y-coordinate)
//
// You have to place n people, including Alice and Bob, at these points such that there is exactly one person at every point. Alice wants to be alone with Bob, so Alice will build a rectangular fence with Alice's position as the upper left corner and Bob's position as the lower right corner of the fence (Note that the fence might not enclose any area, i.e. it can be a line). If any person other than Alice and Bob is either inside the fence or on the fence, Alice will be sad.
//
// Return the number of pairs of points where you can place Alice and Bob, such that Alice does not become sad on building the fence.
//
// Note that Alice can only build a fence with Alice's position as the upper left corner, and Bob's position as the lower right corner. For example, Alice cannot build either of the fences in the picture below with four corners (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3), because:
//
//
// 	With Alice at (3, 3) and Bob at (1, 1), Alice's position is not the upper left corner and Bob's position is not the lower right corner of the fence.
// 	With Alice at (1, 3) and Bob at (1, 1) (as the rectangle shown in the image instead of a line), Bob's position is not the lower right corner of the fence.
//
// Example:
// Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: There is no way to place Alice and Bob such that Alice can build a fence with Alice's position as the upper left corner and Bob's position as the lower right corner. Hence we return 0.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 1000
// 	points[i].length == 2
// 	-109 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 109
// 	All points[i] are distinct.

// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
//   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
//   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.
// - Lattice points inside non-lattice polygon (geometry, number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to count integer coordinate points strictly inside a polygon whose vertices are not restricted to integer coordinates. It's suitable for problems requiring precise geometric counting with non-lattice boundaries.
//   • Idea: This algorithm counts lattice points within a polygon with arbitrary vertices by summing signed contributions from each edge. It reduces the problem to evaluating sums of floor functions, sum(floor(kx+b)), which is solved recursively, typically achieving logarithmic complexity per edge.
//   • Invariants: The sum sum(floor(kx+b)) correctly accumulates points below the current edge segment.; After coordinate transformations, the problem reduces to a sum over a non-negative range with non-negative k and b.
//   • Tips: Decompose the polygon into signed areas under each edge, similar to the shoelace formula.; Handle edge cases where k or b are negative by appropriate transformations.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues when calculating k and b or during transformations.; Incorrectly handling boundary points (points on edges or vertices).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
