// Problem Description:
// You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game on an infinite 2-D grid. You start at the point [0, 0], and you are given a destination point target = [xtarget, ytarget] that you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as a 2D array ghosts, where ghosts[i] = [xi, yi] represents the starting position of the ith ghost. All inputs are integral coordinates.
//
// Each turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either move 1 unit in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west, or stay still. All actions happen simultaneously.
//
// You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it does not count as an escape.
//
// Return true if it is possible to escape regardless of how the ghosts move, otherwise return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: ghosts = [[1,0],[0,3]], target = [0,1]
// Output: true
// Explanation: You can reach the destination (0, 1) after 1 turn, while the ghosts located at (1, 0) and (0, 3) cannot catch up with you.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= ghosts.length <= 100
// 	ghosts[i].length == 2
// 	-104 <= xi, yi <= 104
// 	There can be multiple ghosts in the same location.
// 	target.length == 2
// 	-104 <= xtarget, ytarget <= 104

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Minimum Enclosing Circle (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the smallest circle that contains all given points in a 2D plane, often with a requirement for expected linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: This algorithm iteratively constructs the Minimum Enclosing Circle (MEC) by considering points one by one, potentially updating the circle if a new point lies outside. It achieves an expected linear time complexity, O(N), through randomization.
//   • Invariants: The current circle C is the MEC for the subset of points processed so far.; If C is defined by 1 point p_i, it is the MEC of points processed so far that passes through p_i.
//   • Tips: Randomly shuffle input points to achieve expected linear time complexity.; The Minimum Enclosing Circle is always defined by 2 or 3 points on its boundary.
//   • Pitfalls: A naive implementation without randomization can lead to O(N^3) worst-case time complexity.; Floating-point precision issues can arise in geometric calculations, requiring careful handling.
// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
