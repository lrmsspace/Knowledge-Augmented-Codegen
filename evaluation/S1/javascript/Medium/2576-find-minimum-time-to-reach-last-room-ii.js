// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-reach-last-room-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a dungeon with n x m rooms arranged as a grid.
//
// You are given a 2D array moveTime of size n x m, where moveTime[i][j] represents the minimum time in seconds when you can start moving to that room. You start from the room (0, 0) at time t = 0 and can move to an adjacent room. Moving between adjacent rooms takes one second for one move and two seconds for the next, alternating between the two.
//
// Return the minimum time to reach the room (n - 1, m - 1).
//
// Two rooms are adjacent if they share a common wall, either horizontally or vertically.
//
// Example:
// Input: moveTime = [[0,4],[4,4]]
//
// Output: 7
//
// Explanation:
//
// The minimum time required is 7 seconds.
//
//
// 	At time t == 4, move from room (0, 0) to room (1, 0) in one second.
// 	At time t == 5, move from room (1, 0) to room (1, 1) in two seconds.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n == moveTime.length <= 750
// 	2 <= m == moveTime[i].length <= 750
// 	0 <= moveTime[i][j] <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, array, dijkstra, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum costs without a full priority queue.
//   • Idea: A specialized Breadth-First Search variant that finds shortest paths in graphs with only 0 or 1 edge weights. It uses a deque to process 0-weight edges before 1-weight edges, achieving O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the deque have a distance value of either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.; Nodes pushed to the front of the deque always have a distance equal to the current node's distance.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque to maintain the order of processing nodes.; Add nodes reached via 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a standard queue instead of a deque.; Failing to initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the source.
// - Multi source BFS (queue, graph, multi-source-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest distance from any of a given set of source nodes to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph or grid.
//   • Idea: Multi-source BFS explores a graph or grid by starting from multiple initial nodes simultaneously, finding the shortest path from any of these sources to all other reachable nodes. It operates in O(V + E) time for graphs or O(rows * cols) for grids.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same shortest distance level from any source.; When a node `u` is dequeued, `dist[u]` represents the finalized shortest distance from any source to `u`.
//   • Tips: Initialize distances for all sources to 0 and add them to the queue.; Use a `visited` array or set to prevent redundant processing of nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark initial sources as visited before adding to the queue.; Incorrectly initializing distances for non-source nodes (should be infinity or a large value).
// - Solving assignment problem using min-cost-flow (graph, dijkstra, bellman-ford)
//   • When to use: Use when finding a one-to-one assignment between two sets of entities, such as workers to tasks, to minimize the total cost. It's suitable for problems modelable as min-cost max-flow in a bipartite graph.
//   • Idea: This technique models the assignment problem as a minimum cost maximum flow problem on a specially constructed bipartite graph. It finds a perfect matching with the lowest total cost, typically with a polynomial time complexity depending on the shortest path algorithm used.
//   • Invariants: Flow conservation holds for all intermediate nodes in the network.; The flow on any edge never exceeds its defined capacity.
//   • Tips: Construct a bipartite graph with a source and sink nodes.; Set capacities to 1 for all assignment-related edges to ensure one-to-one mapping.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly modeling capacities or costs on graph edges can lead to wrong solutions.; Forgetting to ensure a perfect matching (flow value equals N) is found for a complete assignment.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
