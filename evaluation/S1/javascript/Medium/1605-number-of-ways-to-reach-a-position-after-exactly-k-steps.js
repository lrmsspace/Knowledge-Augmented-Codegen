// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reach-a-position-after-exactly-k-steps/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two positive integers startPos and endPos. Initially, you are standing at position startPos on an infinite number line. With one step, you can move either one position to the left, or one position to the right.
//
// Given a positive integer k, return the number of different ways to reach the position endPos starting from startPos, such that you perform exactly k steps. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Two ways are considered different if the order of the steps made is not exactly the same.
//
// Note that the number line includes negative integers.
//
// Example:
// Input: startPos = 1, endPos = 2, k = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can reach position 2 from 1 in exactly 3 steps in three ways:
// - 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2.
// - 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2.
// - 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2.
// It can be proven that no other way is possible, so we return 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= startPos, endPos, k <= 1000
//

// - Binomial Coefficients (array, number, mod-exp, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating combinations (n choose k) efficiently, especially for large n, and when results are required modulo a prime or prime power.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes binomial coefficients C(n, k) modulo a given prime m or prime power p^b. It leverages precomputed factorials and their modular inverses to achieve O(1) query time after O(MAXN) or O(MAXN log m) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: Factorials `fact[i]` are correctly computed as `i! % m`.; Modular inverse factorials `invFact[i]` satisfy `(fact[i] * invFact[i]) % m == 1`.
//   • Tips: Precompute factorials modulo m up to MAXN.; Precompute modular inverses of factorials for O(1) query time.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to take modulo at each multiplication step during factorial precomputation.; Using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverse when the modulus is not prime.
// - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
//   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
//   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).
// - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When all subsets of a fixed size K need to be generated, either in lexicographical order or such that successive combinations differ by exactly one element.
//   • Idea: This algorithm enumerates all K-combinations from a set, either in lexicographical order or using a Gray code approach where adjacent combinations differ by a single element. It typically runs in O(N choose K) time, generating each combination in O(K) or O(1) amortized time.
//   • Invariants: Each generated combination contains exactly K distinct elements.; All elements within a combination are unique and from the original set.
//   • Tips: For lexicographical generation, find the rightmost element that can be incremented without exceeding its maximum possible value.; After incrementing an element, set all subsequent elements to their minimum valid values.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions for the rightmost element or its maximum value.; Off-by-one errors when assigning subsequent elements after an increment.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
