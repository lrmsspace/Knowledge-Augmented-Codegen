// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums and three integers k, op1, and op2.
//
// You can perform the following operations on nums:
//
//
// 	Operation 1: Choose an index i and divide nums[i] by 2, rounding up to the nearest whole number. You can perform this operation at most op1 times, and not more than once per index.
// 	Operation 2: Choose an index i and subtract k from nums[i], but only if nums[i] is greater than or equal to k. You can perform this operation at most op2 times, and not more than once per index.
//
//
// Note: Both operations can be applied to the same index, but at most once each.
//
// Return the minimum possible sum of all elements in nums after performing any number of operations.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,8,3,19,3], k = 3, op1 = 1, op2 = 1
//
// Output: 23
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	Apply Operation 2 to nums[1] = 8, making nums[1] = 5.
// 	Apply Operation 1 to nums[3] = 19, making nums[3] = 10.
// 	The resulting array becomes [2, 5, 3, 10, 3], which has the minimum possible sum of 23 after applying the operations.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	0 <= k <= 105
// 	0 <= op1, op2 <= nums.length
//

// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and value, to maximize total value without exceeding a given capacity. It is applicable for resource allocation problems with discrete choices.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack Problem aims to choose items with maximum total value such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It is typically solved using dynamic programming, achieving a time complexity of O(nW) for n items and capacity W.
//   • Invariants: `dp[j]` (in 1D DP) represents the maximum value achievable with capacity `j` using items considered so far.; When processing item `i` and capacity `j` (decreasing `j`), `dp[j-weight_i]` holds the value from previous items for that reduced capacity.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP table with zeros for capacity 0 and unreachable states.; For 0-1 knapsack with 1D DP, iterate capacity `j` in decreasing order.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect iteration order for 1D DP in 0-1 knapsack (using increasing `j`).; Off-by-one errors in item indices or capacity calculations.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When all subsets of a fixed size K need to be generated, either in lexicographical order or such that successive combinations differ by exactly one element.
//   • Idea: This algorithm enumerates all K-combinations from a set, either in lexicographical order or using a Gray code approach where adjacent combinations differ by a single element. It typically runs in O(N choose K) time, generating each combination in O(K) or O(1) amortized time.
//   • Invariants: Each generated combination contains exactly K distinct elements.; All elements within a combination are unique and from the original set.
//   • Tips: For lexicographical generation, find the rightmost element that can be incremented without exceeding its maximum possible value.; After incrementing an element, set all subsequent elements to their minimum valid values.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions for the rightmost element or its maximum value.; Off-by-one errors when assigning subsequent elements after an increment.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
