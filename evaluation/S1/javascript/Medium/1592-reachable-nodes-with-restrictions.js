//
// Problem Description:
// There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.
//
// You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree. You are also given an integer array restricted which represents restricted nodes.
//
// Return the maximum number of nodes you can reach from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
//
// Note that node 0 will not be a restricted node.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,1],[4,0],[0,5],[5,6]], restricted = [4,5]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree.
// We have that [0,1,2,3] are the only nodes that can be reached from node 0 without visiting a restricted node.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 105
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ai, bi < n
// 	ai != bi
// 	edges represents a valid tree.
// 	1 <= restricted.length < n
// 	1 <= restricted[i] < n
// 	All the values of restricted are unique.

// - Breadth-first search (graph, array, bfs, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or traversing a graph level by level to explore all reachable nodes. It is also suitable for finding connected components or checking reachability.
//   • Idea: Breadth-first search explores a graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in terms of edges from a source node to all other reachable nodes. It typically runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or next level of traversal from the source.; All nodes already dequeued have been fully processed, and their unvisited neighbors have been enqueued.
//   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit in a FIFO manner.; Mark nodes as visited immediately upon adding them to the queue to prevent redundant processing and cycles.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs or incorrect path lengths.; Not handling disconnected components if the goal is to traverse the entire graph.
// - Search for connected components in a graph (stack, graph, dfs, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when the goal is to identify distinct groups of interconnected nodes within a graph, or to find all nodes reachable from a specific starting point.
//   • Idea: Depth-First Search (DFS) explores a graph by traversing as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It efficiently finds connected components by visiting all reachable nodes from an unvisited starting point, typically with O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes in the current DFS path from the start node to the current node are on the recursion stack.; Any node marked as visited will not be re-processed by the current DFS call.
//   • Tips: Maintain a 'visited' status for each node to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Iterate through all nodes and start DFS if a node is unvisited to find all components.
//   • Pitfalls: Excessive recursion depth can lead to stack overflow errors for large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited results in infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, deque, 01-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently computes single-source shortest paths, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
//   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds the single-source shortest paths in a graph where all edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1. It uses a deque to process nodes, achieving an optimal time complexity of O(V + E).
//   • Invariants: When a node 'u' is extracted from the front of the deque, 'dist[u]' is its shortest path from the source.; The deque always contains nodes whose distances are either 'D' or 'D+1', where 'D' is the distance of the last node extracted.
//   • Tips: Always push 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Push 1-weight edges to the back of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Pushing 0-weight edges to the back or 1-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Not correctly initializing distances or the source node.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
