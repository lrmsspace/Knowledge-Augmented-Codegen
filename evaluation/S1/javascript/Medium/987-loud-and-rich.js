// Problem Description:
// There is a group of n people labeled from 0 to n - 1 where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of quietness.
//
// You are given an array richer where richer[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that ai has more money than bi and an integer array quiet where quiet[i] is the quietness of the ith person. All the given data in richer are logically correct (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where x is richer than y and y is richer than x at the same time).
//
// Return an integer array answer where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person x.
//
// Example:
// Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
// Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
// Explanation: 
// answer[0] = 5.
// Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.
// The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but it is not clear if they have more money than person 0.
// answer[7] = 7.
// Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7 (which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7.
// The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.
//
// Constraints:
// n == quiet.length
// 	1 <= n <= 500
// 	0 <= quiet[i] < n
// 	All the values of quiet are unique.
// 	0 <= richer.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
// 	0 <= ai, bi < n
// 	ai != bi
// 	All the pairs of richer are unique.
// 	The observations in richer are all logically consistent.

// - Finding articulation points in a graph in O(N+M) (graph, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when identifying critical nodes whose removal would increase the number of connected components in an undirected graph. It's essential for analyzing network robustness and vulnerability.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all articulation points (cut vertices) in an undirected graph using a single Depth First Search traversal. It operates in linear time, O(N+M), where N is vertices and M is edges.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u`, `tin[u]` is its discovery time, and `low[u]` is initialized to `tin[u]`.; After visiting all children `v` of `u` (and their subtrees), `low[u]` will hold the minimum `tin` value reachable from `u` or its descendants via tree edges and at most one back-edge.
//   • Tips: Initialize `tin` (discovery time) and `low` (lowest reachable ancestor) arrays for all vertices.; The root of the DFS tree is an articulation point if it has more than one child in the DFS tree.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize `low[u]` with `tin[u]` before processing children.; Incorrectly applying the `tin[u] <= low[v]` condition to the root node of the DFS tree.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
// - Dijkstra on sparse graphs (heap, queue, dijkstra)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights, especially efficient for sparse graphs.
//   • Idea: Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It uses a priority queue to greedily explore vertices, achieving O(E log V) complexity with a binary heap.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each iteration, dist[u] holds the shortest distance found so far from the source to u.; All vertices already extracted from the priority queue have their final shortest distance determined.
//   • Tips: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently retrieve the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance.; Initialize all distances to infinity and the source distance to zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not work correctly with negative edge weights; Bellman-Ford or SPFA is needed.; Forgetting to mark vertices as visited or handle duplicate entries in the priority queue can lead to incorrectness or TLE.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
