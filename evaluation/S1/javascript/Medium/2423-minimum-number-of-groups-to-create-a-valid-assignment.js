//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a collection of numbered balls and instructed to sort them into boxes for a nearly balanced distribution. There are two rules you must follow:
//
//
// 	Balls with the same box must have the same value. But, if you have more than one ball with the same number, you can put them in different boxes.
// 	The biggest box can only have one more ball than the smallest box.
//
//
// ​Return the fewest number of boxes to sort these balls following these rules.
//
// Example:
// Input:   balls = [3,2,3,2,3] 
//
// Output:   2 
//
// Explanation:
//
// We can sort balls into boxes as follows:
//
//
// 	[3,3,3]
// 	[2,2]
//
//
// The size difference between the two boxes doesn't exceed one.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When searching for a specific element in a sorted collection or finding an optimal value over a monotonic function within a defined range. It efficiently reduces the search space by half in each step.
//   • Idea: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or determines a value that satisfies a monotonic predicate. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The potential answer always lies within the current search interval `[low, high]`.; All elements strictly less than `low` have been determined not to be the answer.
//   • Tips: Ensure the search space exhibits a monotonic property.; Carefully define the `low` and `high` bounds for the search interval.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating `low` or `high` bounds leading to infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing or loop conditions.
// - Stars and bars (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when counting the number of ways to distribute identical items into distinct bins, or finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a linear equation. It is also applicable for problems with lower bounds on variables.
//   • Idea: Stars and bars is a combinatorial technique used to count the number of ways to place 'n' identical items into 'k' distinct bins, or equivalently, to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + ... + xk = n.
//   • Invariants: The total number of 'stars' (items) remains constant throughout any transformation.; The number of 'bars' (separators) is always one less than the number of bins (variables).
//   • Tips: Visualize items as 'stars' and separators as 'bars' to understand the arrangement.; Transform problems with lower bounds (x_i >= a_i) into non-negative solutions (x_i' >= 0).
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing identical items with distinct items, which requires a different counting method.; Incorrectly applying the formula when variables have lower bounds other than zero without transformation.
// - Minimum Enclosing Circle (array, geometry, randomized, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the smallest circle that contains a given set of 2D points. It provides an expected linear time solution for this fundamental geometric problem.
//   • Idea: Welzl's algorithm finds the unique minimum enclosing circle for a set of points using a randomized incremental approach. It achieves an expected time complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: The current candidate circle `C` encloses all points `p_1, ..., p_i` processed so far.; If `p_i` is not contained in `C_{i-1}`, then `p_i` must lie on the boundary of `C_i`.
//   • Tips: Randomly permute input points to ensure expected O(N) performance.; The MEC is uniquely determined by either two points forming a diameter or three points on its boundary.
//   • Pitfalls: Not randomizing the input can lead to a worst-case O(N^3) performance.; Floating-point precision issues can cause incorrect boundary checks or point containment tests.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
