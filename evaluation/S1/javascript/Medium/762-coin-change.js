// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
//
// Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
//
// You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
//
// Example:
// Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= coins.length <= 12
// 	1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1
// 	0 <= amount <= 104
//

// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
//   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
//   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.

var coinChange = function(coins, amount) {
	// We can use a 1D DP array where dp[i] represents the minimum number of coins needed to make up amount i. 
	// We initialize the dp array with a value greater than any possible number of coins (e.g., amount + 1) and set dp[0] to 0 since no coins are needed to make up amount 0.

	// For each coin, we iterate through the amounts from coin value to the target amount and update the dp array.
