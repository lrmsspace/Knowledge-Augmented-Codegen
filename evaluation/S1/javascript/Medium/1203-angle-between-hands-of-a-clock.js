// Problem Description:
// Given two numbers, hour and minutes, return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand.
//
// Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
//
// Example:
// Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
// Output: 165
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= hour <= 12
// 	0 <= minutes <= 59

// - Finding common tangents to two circles (geometry, number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all lines that are simultaneously tangent to two given circles. It is applicable in computational geometry problems requiring the precise relative positioning of circles and lines.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically determines the equations of all common tangent lines to two circles, typically identifying up to four distinct lines. It involves geometric calculations based on circle centers and radii, operating in constant time, O(1).
//   • Invariants: The distance between the two circle centers remains constant.; The radii of both circles are immutable during the tangent calculation.
//   • Tips: Separate calculations for external and internal tangents.; Carefully consider the relative positions of circle centers and radii.
//   • Pitfalls: Overlooking degenerate cases like coincident or concentric circles.; Numerical instability or precision errors with floating-point arithmetic.
// - Oriented area of a triangle (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the orientation of three 2D points (clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear) or calculating the signed area of a triangle formed by them. It's crucial for geometric algorithms like convex hull construction and point-in-polygon tests.
//   • Idea: Calculates the signed area of a triangle defined by three 2D points, indicating their orientation relative to each other. A positive sign typically means counterclockwise, negative means clockwise, and zero indicates collinearity.
//   • Invariants: The sign of the result correctly indicates the orientation of p1, p2, p3 (e.g., positive for counter-clockwise).; If the points are collinear, the calculated oriented area is exactly zero.
//   • Tips: The sign of the result directly indicates the orientation of the points.; The absolute value of the result gives the standard unsigned area of the triangle.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating-point precision issues can lead to incorrect collinearity checks or orientation.; Inconsistent definitions of 'clockwise' vs. 'counterclockwise' can flip the sign interpretation.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, number, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the optimal sequence of jobs to minimize the total completion time (makespan) on two machines, with a fixed processing order (machine 1 then machine 2) for all jobs.
//   • Idea: This problem involves ordering N jobs, each with two processing times (one for each machine), to minimize the overall makespan. Johnson's rule provides an optimal greedy solution for this specific two-machine flow shop problem in O(N log N) or O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed so far maintain the optimal relative order determined by Johnson's rule.; The current makespan is the minimum possible for the jobs already scheduled.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs based on Johnson's rule criteria: jobs with min(a_i, b_i).; Prioritize jobs with shorter machine 1 times or longer machine 2 times for early scheduling.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying Johnson's rule to problems with more than two machines, where it is not optimal.; Incorrectly sorting jobs within the two partitioned sets.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
