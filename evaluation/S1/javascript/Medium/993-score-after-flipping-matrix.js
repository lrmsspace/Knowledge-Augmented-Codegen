// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.
//
// A move consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all 0's to 1's, and all 1's to 0's).
//
// Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.
//
// Return the highest possible score after making any number of moves (including zero moves).
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
// Output: 39
// Explanation: 0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 20
// 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Finding the rank of a matrix (matrix, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix. It's also applicable for understanding the dimension of the vector space spanned by the matrix's rows or columns.
//   • Idea: Determines the rank of a matrix by transforming it into row echelon form using Gaussian elimination. The rank is the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form, with a time complexity of O(N^3).
//   • Invariants: The number of non-zero rows processed so far equals the current rank.; All elements below the pivot in the current column are zeroed out.
//   • Tips: Always choose the largest absolute value pivot for numerical stability.; Swap rows to bring a non-zero element to the pivot position.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect zero checks.; Forgetting to increment rank only when a valid pivot is found.
// - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
//   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
//   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
