//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "babad"
// Output: "bab"
// Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 1000
// 	s consist of only digits and English letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring in a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity by leveraging symmetry.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all palindromic substrings in a string by expanding around centers and utilizing symmetry to avoid redundant comparisons. It achieves a linear time complexity of O(N) by maintaining the rightmost boundary of the longest palindrome found so far.
//   • Invariants: For any index k < i, d[k] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at k.; The pair (l, r) always represents the exclusive boundaries of the palindrome that extends furthest to the right among all processed centers.
//   • Tips: Pre-process the string with delimiters (e.g., '#') to uniformly handle both odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage symmetry: for a center 'i' within the current rightmost palindrome, its mirror 'j' provides a lower bound for the palindrome length at 'i'.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when the mirror palindrome extends beyond the current rightmost palindrome.; Forgetting to update the 'l' and 'r' boundaries after finding a new palindrome that extends further to the right.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, counting, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Use when seeking the longest possible sequence of elements from a given array such that each element is greater than the preceding one, preserving their original relative order.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem identifies the longest possible subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order, preserving their original relative positions. It can be solved efficiently in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree.
//   • Invariants: The `tails` array elements are always strictly increasing.; For any index `k`, `tails[k]` holds the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `k+1`.
//   • Tips: Use a `tails` array to store the smallest ending element for LIS of each length.; Employ binary search on the `tails` array to update or extend subsequences.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence (relative order) with contiguous subarray.; Incorrectly implementing strict vs. non-strict increasing conditions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
