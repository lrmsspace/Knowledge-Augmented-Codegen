// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-space-wasted-with-k-resizing-operations/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are currently designing a dynamic array. You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] is the number of elements that will be in the array at time i. In addition, you are given an integer k, the maximum number of times you can resize the array (to any size).
//
// The size of the array at time t, sizet, must be at least nums[t] because there needs to be enough space in the array to hold all the elements. The space wasted at time t is defined as sizet - nums[t], and the total space wasted is the sum of the space wasted across every time t where 0 <= t < nums.length.
//
// Return the minimum total space wasted if you can resize the array at most k times.
//
// Note: The array can have any size at the start and does not count towards the number of resizing operations.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [10,20], k = 0
// Output: 10
// Explanation: size = [20,20].
// We can set the initial size to be 20.
// The total wasted space is (20 - 10) + (20 - 20) = 10.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 200
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 106
// 	0 <= k <= nums.length - 1
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries, especially Range Minimum/Maximum Queries, on an immutable array very quickly. It is ideal for scenarios where the data does not change and query performance is critical.
//   • Idea: Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes answers for all range queries of power-of-two lengths. It allows O(1) query time for idempotent operations like Range Minimum/Maximum Queries on a static array, with O(N log N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: st[k][i] holds the result for the segment starting at index i with length 2^k.; For any k > 0, st[k][i] combines the results of two adjacent segments of length 2^(k-1).
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values to find the largest power of two in O(1).; Best suited for idempotent operations like minimum, maximum, or GCD.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support array updates; any modification invalidates the structure.; Inefficient for non-idempotent operations like range sum or XOR in O(1).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
