// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-elements-to-groups-with-constraints/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array groups, where groups[i] represents the size of the ith group. You are also given an integer array elements.
//
// Your task is to assign one element to each group based on the following rules:
//
//
// 	An element at index j can be assigned to a group i if groups[i] is divisible by elements[j].
// 	If there are multiple elements that can be assigned, assign the element with the smallest index j.
// 	If no element satisfies the condition for a group, assign -1 to that group.
//
//
// Return an integer array assigned, where assigned[i] is the index of the element chosen for group i, or -1 if no suitable element exists.
//
// Note: An element may be assigned to more than one group.
//
// Example:
// Input: groups = [8,4,3,2,4], elements = [4,2]
//
// Output: [0,0,-1,1,0]
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	elements[0] = 4 is assigned to groups 0, 1, and 4.
// 	elements[1] = 2 is assigned to group 3.
// 	Group 2 cannot be assigned any element.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= groups.length <= 105
// 	1 <= elements.length <= 105
// 	1 <= groups[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= elements[i] <= 105
//

// - Range Minimum Query (array, ds, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the minimum element within specified ranges of an array efficiently, especially for many queries after initial setup.
//   • Idea: A Range Minimum Query (RMQ) problem asks to find the minimum value in a specified range [L, R] of an array. It can be solved with various data structures, often achieving O(1) or O(log N) query time after O(N log N) or O(N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: For any query range [L, R], the returned value is the minimum of elements A[i] where L <= i <= R.; The precomputed data structure correctly stores minimums for all relevant sub-intervals.
//   • Tips: For static arrays, Sparse Table offers O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.; For dynamic arrays (with updates), Segment Tree provides O(log N) query and update times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases for range boundaries (L, R).; High memory usage for Sparse Table if N is very large (N log N space).
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Extended Euclidean Algorithm (number, gcd, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find integer coefficients x and y that satisfy Bézout's identity (ax + by = gcd(a,b)). It is also essential for computing modular multiplicative inverses and solving linear Diophantine equations.
//   • Idea: The Extended Euclidean Algorithm computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers 'a' and 'b', and simultaneously finds integer coefficients 'x' and 'y' such that 'ax + by = gcd(a,b)'. It operates in O(log(min(a,b))) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: x * (initial a) + y * (initial b) = current_a_value; x_1 * (initial a) + y_1 * (initial b) = current_b_value
//   • Tips: Can be implemented using either a recursive or an iterative approach.; The algorithm correctly handles negative integer inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases in recursive implementations can lead to errors.; Potential for integer overflow if coefficients x or y become extremely large, though uncommon.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
