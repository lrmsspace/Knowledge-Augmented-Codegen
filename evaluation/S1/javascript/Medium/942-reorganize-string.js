// Problem Description:
// Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.
//
// Return any possible rearrangement of s or return "" if not possible.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "aab"
// Output: "aba"
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 500
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters.

// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Minimum spanning tree - Prim's algorithm (graph, heap, array, mst-prim, greedy, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree in a connected, weighted graph. It is efficient for both dense graphs (O(V^2)) and sparse graphs (O(E log V)) depending on the implementation.
//   • Idea: Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds an MST by iteratively adding the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the growing tree to a vertex outside the tree. It has a time complexity of O(V^2) for dense graphs using an adjacency matrix or O(E log V) for sparse graphs using a priority queue.
//   • Invariants: All selected vertices and edges form a connected component of the final MST.; For any unselected vertex `v`, `min_e[v]` stores the minimum weight of an edge connecting `v` to the currently selected component.
//   • Tips: For dense graphs, an O(V^2) implementation using an an adjacency matrix and simple array scans is efficient.; For sparse graphs, use a priority queue (min-heap) with an adjacency list to achieve O(E log V) complexity.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating the `min_e` array or priority queue entries can lead to an incorrect MST or performance issues.; Forgetting to mark vertices as 'selected' can lead to cycles or infinite loops.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
//   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
//   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
