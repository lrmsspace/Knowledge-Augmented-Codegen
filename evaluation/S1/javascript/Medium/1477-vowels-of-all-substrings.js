// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/vowels-of-all-substrings/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string word, return the sum of the number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') in every substring of word.
//
// A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.
//
// Note: Due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32-bit integer. Please be careful during the calculations.
//
// Example:
// Input: word = "aba"
// Output: 6
// Explanation: 
// All possible substrings are: "a", "ab", "aba", "b", "ba", and "a".
// - "b" has 0 vowels in it
// - "a", "ab", "ba", and "a" have 1 vowel each
// - "aba" has 2 vowels in it
// Hence, the total sum of vowels = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= word.length <= 105
// 	word consists of lowercase English letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Fibonacci Numbers (number, greedy, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need a unique, non-ambiguous binary representation of positive integers based on Fibonacci numbers, ensuring no two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are used in the sum.
//   • Idea: This algorithm encodes a positive integer into a unique binary string by greedily finding its Zeckendorf representation (sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers). The encoding process typically involves iterating through Fibonacci numbers, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity relative to the input number's magnitude.
//   • Invariants: The remaining value 'n' to be encoded is always non-negative.; The partial binary code constructed so far represents a valid Zeckendorf sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
//   • Tips: Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a certain limit to optimize lookups.; Always start with the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the target value.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the base cases for small numbers like 1 or 2.; Forgetting to append the mandatory final '1' bit to the codeword.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
