// Problem Description:
// There is an infrastructure of n cities with some number of roads connecting these cities. Each roads[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi.
//
// The network rank of two different cities is defined as the total number of directly connected roads to either city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted once.
//
// The maximal network rank of the infrastructure is the maximum network rank of all pairs of different cities.
//
// Given the integer n and the array roads, return the maximal network rank of the entire infrastructure.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, roads = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The network rank of cities 0 and 1 is 4 as there are 4 roads that are connected to either 0 or 1. The road between 0 and 1 is only counted once.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 100
// 	0 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
// 	roads[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ai, bi <= n-1
// 	ai != bi
// 	Each pair of cities has at most one road connecting them.

// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, matrix, matrix-exp, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count the number of paths of a specific length between all pairs of vertices in a graph, or to find reachability in a fixed number of steps.
//   • Idea: This algorithm leverages matrix exponentiation to find the number of paths of a fixed length `k` between all pairs of vertices in a graph. Each matrix multiplication step extends path lengths by one, resulting in an O(N^3 log K) time complexity for an N-vertex graph.
//   • Invariants: After `m` matrix multiplications, `C_m[i][j]` stores the number of paths of length `m` from `i` to `j`.; The initial adjacency matrix `G` remains constant throughout the exponentiation process.
//   • Tips: Represent the graph as an adjacency matrix where `G[i][j]` is the number of direct edges.; Matrix multiplication `C_k * G` yields `C_{k+1}` for path counts.
//   • Pitfalls: Standard matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to O(N^3 log K) overall time complexity.; Memory usage is O(N^2) for storing matrices, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
