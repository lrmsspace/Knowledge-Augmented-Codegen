// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums.
//
// In one move, you can choose one element of nums and change it to any value.
//
// Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums after performing at most three moves.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
// In the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,4].
// In the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,3].
// In the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes [3,3,3,3].
// After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
//

// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use Merge Sort when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or linked lists where random access is costly.
//   • Idea: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: Each sub-array passed to merge is sorted.; The merge operation combines two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array.
//   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to maintain stability.; Consider iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: High space complexity due to auxiliary arrays.; Overhead of recursion can be significant for small inputs.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to perform standard stack operations (push, pop) and also query the minimum element currently in the stack, all in constant time.
//   • Idea: Augments a standard stack by storing each element along with the minimum value encountered up to that point in the stack. This allows O(1) retrieval of the current minimum, while push and pop operations also remain O(1).
//   • Invariants: The top element's second component (minimum_so_far) always represents the minimum value currently in the entire stack.; For any element (value, min_so_far) in the stack, min_so_far is the minimum of 'value' and all elements below it.
//   • Tips: Store elements as pairs: (actual_value, minimum_at_this_level).; When pushing, the new minimum_at_this_level is min(new_value, stack.top().second) if stack is not empty, else new_value.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case when calculating the minimum for a new element.; Incorrectly assuming the minimum can be tracked with a single auxiliary variable without considering pops.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
