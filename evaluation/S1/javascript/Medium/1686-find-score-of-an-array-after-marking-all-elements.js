// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-score-of-an-array-after-marking-all-elements/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.
//
// Starting with score = 0, apply the following algorithm:
//
//
// 	Choose the smallest integer of the array that is not marked. If there is a tie, choose the one with the smallest index.
// 	Add the value of the chosen integer to score.
// 	Mark the chosen element and its two adjacent elements if they exist.
// 	Repeat until all the array elements are marked.
//
//
// Return the score you get after applying the above algorithm.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,1,3,4,5,2]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
// - 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
// - 2 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its left adjacent element: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
// - 4 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
// Our score is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 106
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Priority Queues (heap, stack, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently retrieve the element with the highest (or lowest) priority from a collection, especially when elements are added or removed frequently.
//   • Idea: A priority queue is a data structure that allows efficient retrieval of the element with the highest or lowest priority, and efficient insertion of new elements. Operations typically run in logarithmic time, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The priority queue maintains the heap property: parent nodes are always greater than/equal to (or less than/equal to) their children.; For a K-selection problem, the priority queue contains at most K elements, representing the K largest/smallest seen so far.
//   • Tips: Use a min-priority queue to find the K largest elements by keeping at most K elements.; Use a max-priority queue to find the K smallest elements by keeping at most K elements.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing min-priority queue with max-priority queue for the desired extremum.; Inefficient underlying implementation leading to O(N) operations instead of O(log N).
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Minimum spanning tree - Prim's algorithm (graph, heap, array, mst-prim, greedy, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree in a connected, weighted graph. It is efficient for both dense graphs (O(V^2)) and sparse graphs (O(E log V)) depending on the implementation.
//   • Idea: Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds an MST by iteratively adding the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the growing tree to a vertex outside the tree. It has a time complexity of O(V^2) for dense graphs using an adjacency matrix or O(E log V) for sparse graphs using a priority queue.
//   • Invariants: All selected vertices and edges form a connected component of the final MST.; For any unselected vertex `v`, `min_e[v]` stores the minimum weight of an edge connecting `v` to the currently selected component.
//   • Tips: For dense graphs, an O(V^2) implementation using an an adjacency matrix and simple array scans is efficient.; For sparse graphs, use a priority queue (min-heap) with an adjacency list to achieve O(E log V) complexity.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating the `min_e` array or priority queue entries can lead to an incorrect MST or performance issues.; Forgetting to mark vertices as 'selected' can lead to cycles or infinite loops.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
