//
// Problem Description:
// There is a rectangular brick wall in front of you with n rows of bricks. The ith row has some number of bricks each of the same height (i.e., one unit) but they can be of different widths. The total width of each row is the same.
//
// Draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks. If your line goes through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.
//
// Given the 2D array wall that contains the information about the wall, return the minimum number of crossed bricks after drawing such a vertical line.
//
// Example:
// Input: wall = [[1,2,2,1],[3,1,2],[1,3,2],[2,4],[3,1,2],[1,3,1,1]]
// Output: 2
//
// Constraints:
// n == wall.length
// 	1 <= n <= 104
// 	1 <= wall[i].length <= 104
// 	1 <= sum(wall[i].length) <= 2 * 104
// 	sum(wall[i]) is the same for each row i.
// 	1 <= wall[i][j] <= 231 - 1

// - Lattice points inside non-lattice polygon (geometry, number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to count integer coordinate points strictly inside a polygon whose vertices are not restricted to integer coordinates. It's suitable for problems requiring precise geometric counting with non-lattice boundaries.
//   • Idea: This algorithm counts lattice points within a polygon with arbitrary vertices by summing signed contributions from each edge. It reduces the problem to evaluating sums of floor functions, sum(floor(kx+b)), which is solved recursively, typically achieving logarithmic complexity per edge.
//   • Invariants: The sum sum(floor(kx+b)) correctly accumulates points below the current edge segment.; After coordinate transformations, the problem reduces to a sum over a non-negative range with non-negative k and b.
//   • Tips: Decompose the polygon into signed areas under each edge, similar to the shoelace formula.; Handle edge cases where k or b are negative by appropriate transformations.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues when calculating k and b or during transformations.; Incorrectly handling boundary points (points on edges or vertices).
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (ds, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently find the smallest non-negative integer not present in a dynamic sequence or range, supporting both updates and queries in logarithmic time.
//   • Idea: This technique finds the Minimal Excluded (MEX) value in a sequence by maintaining counts of distinct elements in ranges using a specialized data structure, typically a segment tree. It supports both updates and queries in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each segment tree node accurately reflects the count of distinct numbers within its corresponding range.; If a range [L, R) contains R-L distinct numbers, then all integers from L to R-1 are present.
//   • Tips: Implement a segment tree where each node stores the count of distinct numbers in its range.; The binary search for MEX checks if a range [0, k) contains k distinct numbers to decide which child to traverse.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating distinct counts in segment tree nodes, especially after updates.; Off-by-one errors when comparing the number of distinct elements with the expected count for a full range.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
