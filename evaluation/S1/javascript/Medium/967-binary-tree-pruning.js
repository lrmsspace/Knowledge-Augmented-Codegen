//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.
//
// A subtree of a node node is node plus every node that is a descendant of node.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,null,0,0,1]
// Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
// Explanation: 
// Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
// The diagram on the right represents the answer.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 200].
// 	Node.val is either 0 or 1.

// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Deleting from a data structure in_log_n (ds, segment-tree, dfs, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when processing a sequence of additions, deletions, and queries offline, where elements have specific time intervals of existence. It efficiently handles dynamic data structure operations by leveraging a segment tree over time.
//   • Idea: This technique uses a segment tree over the timeline of queries to manage elements with varying lifespans. Queries are processed offline via DFS, adding elements upon entering a node and undoing additions upon exiting, achieving O(T(n) log n) deletion complexity.
//   • Invariants: When entering a segment tree node, all elements associated with that node's time range are added to the active data structure.; When exiting a segment tree node, all elements added upon entry are removed, restoring the data structure to its state before entering.
//   • Tips: Ensure the base data structure supports efficient addition and undo operations.; Carefully manage element additions and removals during DFS traversal.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to undo changes when backtracking from a segment tree node.; Incorrectly mapping element lifespans to segment tree nodes.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, binary-lifting, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use binary lifting when you need to answer multiple Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries or ancestor relationship checks efficiently on a static tree.
//   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestor pointers using DFS to answer Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries and ancestor checks in O(log N) time per query, after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` and power `k`, `up[u][k]` is the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; `depth[u]` correctly represents the distance from the root to node `u`.
//   • Tips: Precompute `up[u][k]` as the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; Use DFS to fill the `up` array and node depths.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating `log N` for array dimensions.; Failing to handle the root node's ancestors (e.g., `up[root][k]` should be itself or an invalid node).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
