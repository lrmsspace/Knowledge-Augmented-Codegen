// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.
//
// Note that n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3
// Output: 0
// Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= n <= 104
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Factorial modulo 
// p (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this when calculating factorials or expressions involving factorials in fractions modulo a prime `p`, especially when `p` is small and factors of `p` need to be explicitly handled for cancellation.
//   • Idea: This technique computes `n! mod p` by separating the factors of `p` from the remaining product, allowing for correct modular division in expressions like binomial coefficients.
//   • Invariants: The running product `P` always holds the value of `(i-1)!` with all factors of `p` removed, modulo `p`.; The variable `count_p` accurately stores the total exponent of `p` in `(i-1)!`.
//   • Tips: Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo `p` for terms not divisible by `p`.; Use Fermat's Little Theorem to find modular inverses when `p` is prime.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying modular inverse when the divisor is a multiple of `p` or `p` is not prime.; Forgetting to handle the exponent of `p` separately, which can lead to an incorrect zero result.
// - Z-function and its calculation (string, array, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a pattern within a text, or to identify repeated prefixes within a string efficiently.
//   • Idea: The Z-function computes an array where each element z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the string and its suffix starting at index i. It runs in linear time, O(N), where N is the length of the string.
//   • Invariants: For all j < i, z[j] correctly stores the length of the longest common prefix between S and S[j...].; The segment [l, r-1] represents the rightmost segment that is a prefix of S and has been fully processed.
//   • Tips: Initialize z[0] to 0 (or N, depending on definition) and handle it as a base case.; Utilize previously computed Z-values to avoid redundant comparisons, especially within the 'rightmost matching segment' [l, r].
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating or using the 'rightmost matching segment' boundaries (l and r).; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices or lengths, especially with 0-based vs. 1-based indexing.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
