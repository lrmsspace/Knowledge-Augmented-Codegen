// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-of-a-path-between-two-cities/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi with a distance equal to distancei. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.
//
// The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.
//
// Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities 1 and n.
//
// Note:
//
//
// 	A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
// 	It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities 1 and n multiple times along the path.
// 	The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between 1 and n.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
// It can be shown that no other path has less score.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= roads.length <= 105
// 	roads[i].length == 3
// 	1 <= ai, bi <= n
// 	ai != bi
// 	1 <= distancei <= 104
// 	There are no repeated edges.
// 	There is at least one path between 1 and n.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Breadth-first search (graph, queue, array, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or when exploring all reachable nodes level by level. It is also suitable for problems requiring traversal of all nodes at a specific distance from a source.
//   • Idea: Breadth-first search systematically explores a graph level by level, ensuring that all nodes at distance k are visited before any nodes at distance k+1. It finds the shortest path in terms of number of edges for unweighted graphs in O(V + E) time.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue have been discovered and marked, but their adjacent nodes have not yet been fully explored.; For any node v marked as visited, distTo[v] stores the shortest path length from the source s to v.
//   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit.; Mark nodes as visited to prevent cycles and redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops or incorrect paths.; Not handling disconnected graphs correctly.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Directed Graphs (graph, matrix, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine reachability between all pairs of vertices in a directed graph, especially for small or dense graphs where O(V*(V+E)) time is acceptable.
//   • Idea: This approach determines all-pairs reachability in a directed graph by performing a Depth-First Search starting from each vertex. It has a time complexity of O(V*(V+E)) and a space complexity of O(V^2).
//   • Invariants: For any vertex u, after its dedicated DFS completes, TC[u][v] is true for all v reachable from u.; The transitive closure matrix TC accurately reflects all-pairs reachability in the original graph.
//   • Tips: Initialize a boolean matrix to store reachability results.; For each vertex, perform a full DFS to mark all nodes reachable from it.
//   • Pitfalls: High time complexity O(V*(V+E)) makes it unsuitable for large sparse graphs.; High space complexity O(V^2) can be prohibitive for graphs with many vertices.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
