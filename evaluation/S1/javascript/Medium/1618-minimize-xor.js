// Problem Description:
// Given two positive integers num1 and num2, find the positive integer x such that:
//
//
// 	x has the same number of set bits as num2, and
// 	The value x XOR num1 is minimal.
//
//
// Note that XOR is the bitwise XOR operation.
//
// Return the integer x. The test cases are generated such that x is uniquely determined.
//
// The number of set bits of an integer is the number of 1's in its binary representation.
//
// Example:
// Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 5
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0011 and 0101, respectively.
// The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 3 = 0 is minimal.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= num1, num2 <= 109
//

// - Fibonacci Numbers (number, greedy, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need a unique, non-ambiguous binary representation of positive integers based on Fibonacci numbers, ensuring no two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are used in the sum.
//   • Idea: This algorithm encodes a positive integer into a unique binary string by greedily finding its Zeckendorf representation (sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers). The encoding process typically involves iterating through Fibonacci numbers, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity relative to the input number's magnitude.
//   • Invariants: The remaining value 'n' to be encoded is always non-negative.; The partial binary code constructed so far represents a valid Zeckendorf sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
//   • Tips: Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a certain limit to optimize lookups.; Always start with the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the target value.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the base cases for small numbers like 1 or 2.; Forgetting to append the mandatory final '1' bit to the codeword.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to iterate through all possible submasks of a given bitmask efficiently, typically for problems involving subsets or combinations represented by bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks of a given bitmask in descending order using a clever bitwise trick. It processes each submask in O(1) time, leading to an overall complexity of O(2^k) where k is the number of set bits in the original mask.
//   • Invariants: Each `s` generated is a valid submask of the original mask `m`.; The value of `s` strictly decreases in each iteration until it reaches 0 (or the loop terminates).
//   • Tips: Always consider processing the submask 0 separately if it's a valid case for your problem.; The iteration naturally generates submasks in strictly descending numerical order.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting that the standard loop structure `for (int s = m; s > 0; s = (s - 1) & m)` omits submask 0.; Incorrectly assuming the iteration order is ascending; it is always descending.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
