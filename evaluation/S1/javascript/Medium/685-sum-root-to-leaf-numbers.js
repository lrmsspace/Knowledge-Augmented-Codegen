// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.
//
// Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.
//
//
// 	For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
//
//
// Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
//
// A leaf node is a node with no children.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,2,3]
// Output: 25
// Explanation:
// The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
// The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
// Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
// 	0 <= Node.val <= 9
// 	The depth of the tree will not exceed 10.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Balanced Search Trees (tree, ds, recursion)
//   • When to use: When needing a self-balancing search tree that guarantees logarithmic time complexity for search and insertion operations. Useful for maintaining data in sorted order with consistent performance, especially when frequent updates are expected.
//   • Idea: A 2-3 tree is a self-balancing search tree where every node has either two children (a 2-node) or three children (a 3-node), ensuring all leaves are at the same depth. It guarantees O(log N) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
//   • Invariants: All leaves are at the same depth from the root.; Every node is either a 2-node (one key, two children) or a 3-node (two keys, three children).
//   • Tips: Understand the two node types: 2-nodes (one key, two children) and 3-nodes (two keys, three children).; Insertion always starts by finding the leaf position, then propagates splits upwards if a 4-node is formed.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the promotion of keys during node splits can break the tree's structure.; Forgetting to update parent links after a node split or merge operation.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
