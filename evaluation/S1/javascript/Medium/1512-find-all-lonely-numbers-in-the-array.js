// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-lonely-numbers-in-the-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums. A number x is lonely when it appears only once, and no adjacent numbers (i.e. x + 1 and x - 1) appear in the array.
//
// Return all lonely numbers in nums. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [10,6,5,8]
// Output: [10,8]
// Explanation: 
// - 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear in nums.
// - 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums.
// - 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa.
// Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [10, 8].
// Note that [8, 10] may also be returned.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 106
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Binomial Coefficients (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to calculate the number of ways to choose k items from n distinct items, often under modular constraints.
//   • Idea: Binomial coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n distinct items. They can be computed using Pascal's identity or factorials, with complexity varying based on the method and modulo requirements.
//   • Invariants: For Pascal's triangle, dp[i][j] stores C(i, j).; For factorial method, fact[i] stores i! % M.
//   • Tips: Use Pascal's triangle for small n and k values.; Precompute factorials and inverse factorials for larger n modulo a prime.
//   • Pitfalls: Overflow with large factorials if not using modular arithmetic.; Division by zero when computing inverse modulo if modulus is not prime.
// - Reservoir Sampling (array, randomized, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to randomly select a fixed number of items (k) from a stream or a very large dataset of unknown size, ensuring each item has an equal probability of selection in a single pass.
//   • Idea: Reservoir sampling is a randomized algorithm that selects k items from a list containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number, ensuring each item has an equal probability of being selected. It processes the input in a single pass with O(N) time complexity and O(k) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The reservoir always contains exactly k elements.; Any element processed up to the current index `i` has a k/(i+1) probability of being in the reservoir.
//   • Tips: Initialize the reservoir with the first k elements from the stream.; For each subsequent element, generate a random index from 0 to current_stream_index.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize the reservoir with the first k elements.; Generating random indices outside the valid range [0, current_stream_index] or [0, k-1].
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
