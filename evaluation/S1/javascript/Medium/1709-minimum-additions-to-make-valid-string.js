// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-additions-to-make-valid-string/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string word to which you can insert letters "a", "b" or "c" anywhere and any number of times, return the minimum number of letters that must be inserted so that word becomes valid.
//
// A string is called valid if it can be formed by concatenating the string "abc" several times.
//
// Example:
// Input: word = "b"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Insert the letter "a" right before "b", and the letter "c" right next to "b" to obtain the valid string "abc".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= word.length <= 50
// 	word consists of letters "a", "b" and "c" only.

// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently represent all distinct substrings of a string, or perform various string operations like counting unique substrings, finding occurrences, or string matching in an online fashion.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a powerful data structure that represents all distinct substrings of a given string in a compact form, typically as a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG). It can be constructed in linear time O(N) and space O(N) for a string of length N.
//   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end-positions in the original string.; For any state `v`, `len(v)` is the length of the longest string represented by `v`.
//   • Tips: Understand the properties of `len` (length of the longest string in a state) and `link` (suffix link to the longest proper suffix).; The construction is online, processing characters one by one from left to right.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `link` updates, especially when cloning states during construction.; Forgetting to update the `last` pointer after each character addition step.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine to minimize the total weighted completion time, where each job has a processing time and a linear penalty coefficient.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine with linear penalty functions by sorting jobs based on a specific ratio. It achieves an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The partial schedule constructed so far is optimal for the jobs included.; For any two adjacent jobs 'j' and 'k' in the final schedule, if 'j' precedes 'k', then 'c_j/t_j >= c_k/t_k'.
//   • Tips: Derive the sorting criterion using an exchange argument for adjacent jobs.; The optimal order is determined by the ratio of cost coefficient to processing time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the sorting criterion, especially the ratio order.; Overlooking edge cases like zero processing times or zero penalty coefficients.
// - Minimum Enclosing Circle (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the smallest circle that contains all given points in a 2D plane, often with a requirement for expected linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: This algorithm iteratively constructs the Minimum Enclosing Circle (MEC) by considering points one by one, potentially updating the circle if a new point lies outside. It achieves an expected linear time complexity, O(N), through randomization.
//   • Invariants: The current circle C is the MEC for the subset of points processed so far.; If C is defined by 1 point p_i, it is the MEC of points processed so far that passes through p_i.
//   • Tips: Randomly shuffle input points to achieve expected linear time complexity.; The Minimum Enclosing Circle is always defined by 2 or 3 points on its boundary.
//   • Pitfalls: A naive implementation without randomization can lead to O(N^3) worst-case time complexity.; Floating-point precision issues can arise in geometric calculations, requiring careful handling.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
