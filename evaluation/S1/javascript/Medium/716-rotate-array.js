// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
// Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
// Explanation:
// rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
// rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
// rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
// 	0 <= k <= 105
//
//
//  
// Follow up:
//
//
// 	Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
// 	Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Quicksort (array, two-pointers, randomized)
//   • When to use: Use Quicksort for efficient in-place sorting of arrays, especially when average-case performance and cache efficiency are prioritized. It is suitable for large datasets where memory usage is a concern.
//   • Idea: Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot element, then recursively sorts the two resulting subarrays. Its average time complexity is O(N log N), but can degrade to O(N^2) in the worst case.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the `lt` pointer are less than the pivot value.; All elements to the right of the `gt` pointer are greater than the pivot value.
//   • Tips: Randomly shuffle the input or choose a random pivot to ensure average-case performance.; Employ 3-way partitioning to efficiently handle duplicate keys and avoid quadratic worst-case scenarios.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to handle duplicate keys can lead to quadratic time complexity.; Incorrect pointer crossing logic can cause infinite loops or array out-of-bounds errors.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring within a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity for this task.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all maximal palindromic substrings centered at each position in a string by leveraging symmetry and previously computed results. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: d_odd[i] stores the radius of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.; The (l, r) interval always defines the rightmost palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with delimiters to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Maintain the current rightmost boundary `r` of the largest palindrome found.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update the `(l, r)` boundaries after processing each center.; Incorrectly calculating mirror positions or handling boundary cases for `i > r`.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
