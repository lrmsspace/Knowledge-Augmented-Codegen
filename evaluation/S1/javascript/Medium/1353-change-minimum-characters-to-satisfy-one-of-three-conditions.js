// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/change-minimum-characters-to-satisfy-one-of-three-conditions/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two strings a and b that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in a or b to any lowercase letter.
//
// Your goal is to satisfy one of the following three conditions:
//
//
// 	Every letter in a is strictly less than every letter in b in the alphabet.
// 	Every letter in b is strictly less than every letter in a in the alphabet.
// 	Both a and b consist of only one distinct letter.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve your goal.
//
// Example:
// Input: a = "aba", b = "caa"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Consider the best way to make each condition true:
// 1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.
// 2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.
// 3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.
// The best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 105
// 	a and b consist only of lowercase letters.

// - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences of a pattern in a text, analyzing string periodicity, or counting distinct substrings. It is especially useful for processing extremely long or recursively defined strings where explicit construction is impossible.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm leverages a precomputed prefix function (LPS array) to avoid redundant comparisons during string searching, achieving linear time complexity. The prefix function itself determines the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix, enabling various string property analyses in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: For any index `i`, `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i]`.; During prefix function computation, `j` always represents the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i-1]` that is also a suffix.
//   • Tips: The prefix function `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix.; Concatenate pattern, a unique separator, and text (`P + # + T`) to find all pattern occurrences.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors with array indexing or the precise definition of the prefix function.; Incorrectly handling the unique separator character in concatenated strings, leading to false matches.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
