// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-string-after-substring-operation/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Perform the following operation:
//
//
// 	Select any non-empty substring then replace every letter of the substring with the preceding letter of the English alphabet. For example, 'b' is converted to 'a', and 'a' is converted to 'z'.
//
//
// Return the lexicographically smallest string after performing the operation.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "cbabc"
//
// Output: "baabc"
//
// Explanation:
//
// Perform the operation on the substring starting at index 0, and ending at index 1 inclusive.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all palindromic substrings within a given string, or determine the longest palindromic substring, in optimal linear time.
//   • Idea: Manacher's Algorithm efficiently finds the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at each position in a given string, handling both odd and even lengths uniformly via preprocessing. It achieves this in optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: p[i] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at i in the transformed string.; The right_boundary always marks the rightmost extent of the largest palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with a unique delimiter to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage the mirror property around the current center to initialize palindrome radii.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when converting `p` array values back to original string indices or lengths.; Incorrectly handling the boundaries of the preprocessed string.
// - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
//   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
//   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
//   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
