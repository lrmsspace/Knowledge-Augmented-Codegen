// Problem Description:
// Given two n x n binary matrices mat and target, return true if it is possible to make mat equal to target by rotating mat in 90-degree increments, or false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: mat = [[0,1],[1,0]], target = [[1,0],[0,1]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: We can rotate mat 90 degrees clockwise to make mat equal target.
//
// Constraints:
// n == mat.length == target.length
// 	n == mat[i].length == target[i].length
// 	1 <= n <= 10
// 	mat[i][j] and target[i][j] are either 0 or 1.

// - Simulated Annealing (array, number, randomized, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when seeking a near-optimal solution for complex optimization problems with many local optima, especially when exact solutions are computationally infeasible or too slow.
//   • Idea: Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic metaheuristic for global optimization, inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It explores the search space by accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time, aiming to escape local optima.
//   • Invariants: The `s_best` state always represents the lowest energy found across all iterations so far.; The temperature `T` is always non-negative and decreases monotonically with each iteration.
//   • Tips: Start with a sufficiently high initial temperature to allow broad exploration.; Choose a slow cooling schedule (decay rate) for better solution quality, at the cost of longer runtime.
//   • Pitfalls: Getting stuck in local minima if the cooling schedule is too fast.; Excessive runtime if the cooling schedule is too slow or initial temperature is too high.
// - Fibonacci Numbers (matrix, matrix-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compute the N-th Fibonacci number or similar linear recurrence relations for very large N efficiently, typically in logarithmic time.
//   • Idea: This method computes the N-th Fibonacci number by transforming the linear recurrence into a matrix multiplication, then using binary exponentiation (matrix exponentiation) to raise the transformation matrix to the N-th power. It achieves O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The base matrix M = [[1, 1], [1, 0]] correctly transforms (F_k, F_{k-1}) to (F_{k+1}, F_k).; After k matrix multiplications, the accumulated matrix represents M^k.
//   • Tips: Understand binary exponentiation for matrices to efficiently compute powers.; The base transformation matrix for Fibonacci is typically [[1, 1], [1, 0]].
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly setting up the base matrix or initial vector.; Forgetting to apply modulo operations, leading to integer overflow for large numbers.
// - Circle-Circle Intersection (geometry, number, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the common points where two circles intersect on a 2D plane, handling cases from no intersection to infinite points.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection points of two circles by algebraically transforming their equations into a system involving one circle and one line. It typically achieves O(1) time complexity for finding the intersection points.
//   • Invariants: The relative positions and radii of the circles remain unchanged after coordinate translation.; The derived linear equation represents the radical axis of the two circles.
//   • Tips: Translate one circle to the origin to simplify the equations.; Subtract the two circle equations to derive a linear equation (the radical axis).
//   • Pitfalls: Numerical instability due to floating-point arithmetic, especially for tangent cases.; Forgetting to translate the resulting intersection points back to the original coordinate system.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
