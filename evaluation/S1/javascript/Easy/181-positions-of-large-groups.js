// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/positions-of-large-groups/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// In a string s of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.
//
// For example, a string like s = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z", and "yy".
//
// A group is identified by an interval [start, end], where start and end denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group. In the above example, "xxxx" has the interval [3,6].
//
// A group is considered large if it has 3 or more characters.
//
// Return the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order by start index.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "abbxxxxzzy"
// Output: [[3,6]]
// Explanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with start index 3 and end index 6.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 1000
// 	s contains lowercase English letters only.

// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
// - String Sorts (array, string, number, radix-sort, counting-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting a large collection of fixed-length strings or integers, especially when the key range (alphabet size) is small. It is efficient for data with uniform key lengths.
//   • Idea: LSD Radix Sort sorts elements by processing digits or characters from the least significant to the most significant, using a stable counting sort for each position. It achieves a time complexity of O(W * (N + R)), where W is the key length, N is the number of items, and R is the radix.
//   • Invariants: After each pass 'd' (from 'w-1' down to '0'), the array 'a' is stably sorted based on characters from position 'd' to 'w-1'.; The 'count' array accurately reflects the frequency of each character at the current digit 'd' before cumulation.
//   • Tips: Utilize counting sort as the stable inner sorting algorithm for each digit pass.; Process characters or digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for variable-length strings without proper padding or specialized handling.; Can be slower than comparison sorts for small input sizes or very large radix (R).
// - Z-function and its calculation (string, array, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the length of the longest common prefix between a string and all its suffixes efficiently. It is fundamental for various string matching and pattern searching problems.
//   • Idea: The Z-function computes an array where each element z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the original string and its suffix starting at index i. This algorithm calculates the entire Z-array in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For all k < i, z[k] has been correctly computed.; The interval [l, r) always represents the rightmost segment match found so far.
//   • Tips: Leverage previously computed Z-values to avoid redundant comparisons.; Maintain a [l, r) window representing the rightmost segment match found so far.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the base case z[0] (usually set to 0).; Off-by-one errors when calculating the length of the prefix or updating the window.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
