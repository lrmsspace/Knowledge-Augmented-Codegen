// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
// Output: true
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
// 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Checking a graph for acyclicity and finding a cycle in O(M) (graph, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine if a graph contains any cycles or to identify one such cycle. It is applicable to both directed and undirected graphs.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses Depth First Search to detect cycles in a graph by tracking visited states of nodes during traversal. It runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently on the DFS recursion stack are marked as 'gray' (or equivalent).; All nodes fully explored and not part of the current path are marked as 'black' (or equivalent).
//   • Tips: For directed graphs, use a three-color scheme (white, gray, black) to distinguish states.; For undirected graphs, a simple visited array and checking against the immediate parent is sufficient.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the parent edge in undirected graphs can lead to false cycle detections.; Failing to distinguish between nodes currently in the recursion stack (gray) and fully processed nodes (black) in directed graphs.
// - Treap (Cartesian tree) (tree, recursion, binary-search)
//   • When to use: When you need a self-balancing binary search tree that supports efficient split and merge operations, often used for dynamic set management or range queries on mutable data.
//   • Idea: A Treap is a randomized binary search tree that maintains both BST properties on keys and heap properties on priorities (randomly assigned). It supports efficient operations like split and merge, typically with an average time complexity of O(log N).
//   • Invariants: For any node, its key is greater than or equal to all keys in its left subtree.; For any node, its key is less than all keys in its right subtree.
//   • Tips: Understand the recursive nature of Split and Merge operations.; Randomly assign priorities (Y values) to ensure probabilistic balancing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect handling of null pointers or empty subtrees in recursion.; Forgetting to update parent pointers or root pointers after operations.
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
