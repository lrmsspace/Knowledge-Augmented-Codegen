// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// There are n availabe seats and n students standing in a room. You are given an array seats of length n, where seats[i] is the position of the ith seat. You are also given the array students of length n, where students[j] is the position of the jth student.
//
// You may perform the following move any number of times:
//
//
// 	Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)
//
//
// Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.
//
// Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.
//
// Example:
// Input: seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
// - The first student is moved from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
// - The second student is moved from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
// - The third student is moved from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
// In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.
//
// Constraints:
// n == seats.length == students.length
// 	1 <= n <= 100
// 	1 <= seats[i], students[j] <= 100
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
// - Hungarian algorithm for solving the assignment problem (matrix, graph, greedy, bfs)
//   • When to use: Finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs or uniform-cost state-space searches. Explores states layer by layer.
//   • Idea: Explores all reachable nodes in a graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. It operates in O(V + E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same distance from the source.; All nodes visited so far have their shortest distance from the source determined.
//   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit.; Mark nodes as visited to prevent cycles and redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops.; Incorrectly handling disconnected components.
// - Solving assignment problem using min-cost-flow (graph, dijkstra, bellman-ford)
//   • When to use: Use when finding a one-to-one assignment between two sets of entities, such as workers to tasks, to minimize the total cost. It's suitable for problems modelable as min-cost max-flow in a bipartite graph.
//   • Idea: This technique models the assignment problem as a minimum cost maximum flow problem on a specially constructed bipartite graph. It finds a perfect matching with the lowest total cost, typically with a polynomial time complexity depending on the shortest path algorithm used.
//   • Invariants: Flow conservation holds for all intermediate nodes in the network.; The flow on any edge never exceeds its defined capacity.
//   • Tips: Construct a bipartite graph with a source and sink nodes.; Set capacities to 1 for all assignment-related edges to ensure one-to-one mapping.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly modeling capacities or costs on graph edges can lead to wrong solutions.; Forgetting to ensure a perfect matching (flow value equals N) is found for a complete assignment.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
