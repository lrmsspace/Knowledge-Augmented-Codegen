// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-transform-of-an-array/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers arr, replace each element with its rank.
//
// The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:
//
//
// 	Rank is an integer starting from 1.
// 	The larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.
// 	Rank should be as small as possible.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [40,10,20,30]
// Output: [4,1,2,3]
// Explanation: 40 is the largest element. 10 is the smallest. 20 is the second smallest. 30 is the third smallest.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= arr.length <= 105
// 	-109 <= arr[i] <= 109
//

// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, coordinate-compress, segment-tree, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements must be strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal substructure on sequences with an increasing property.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are in increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree with coordinate compression.
//   • Invariants: The `dp` array (or segment tree) stores information about the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The `dp` array, if used, remains sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) solution uses a `dp` array storing the smallest ending element for all increasing subsequences of a given length.; Binary search (`lower_bound`) efficiently finds the correct position to update in the `dp` array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates; LIS typically requires strictly increasing elements.
// - bucket-sort (array, bucket-sort)
//   • When to use: When the input elements are uniformly distributed across a specific range, allowing for efficient partitioning and sorting.
//   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket, then concatenates them. It achieves O(N+K) average time complexity, where N is elements and K is buckets, assuming uniform distribution.
//   • Invariants: All elements from the input are initially present in the unsorted collection.; After distribution, each element resides in exactly one bucket, corresponding to its value range.
//   • Tips: Choose the number of buckets carefully based on data range and distribution.; Use an efficient sorting algorithm for individual buckets (e.g., insertion sort for small buckets).
//   • Pitfalls: Poor performance with non-uniform data distribution, leading to elements clustering in few buckets.; Requires knowing the range of input values beforehand to define bucket boundaries.
// - Convex Hull construction (geometry, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a plane. It is fundamental for various geometric algorithms and optimization problems.
//   • Idea: Convex hull construction identifies the subset of points that form the vertices of the smallest convex polygon containing all given points. Common algorithms achieve this in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sequence of points currently forming the hull maintains a convex property.; All points considered up to the current iteration are either part of the hull or lie within the polygon defined by the hull.
//   • Tips: Sort points by X-coordinate (and Y for ties) as a common preprocessing step.; Consider algorithms like Graham Scan or Monotone Chain for efficiency.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect orientation calculations.; Incorrectly handling collinear points can result in non-minimal hulls or errors.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
