// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/make-three-strings-equal/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given three strings: s1, s2, and s3. In one operation you can choose one of these strings and delete its rightmost character. Note that you cannot completely empty a string.
//
// Return the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal. If it is impossible to make them equal, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "abb", s3 = "ab"
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation: Deleting the rightmost character from both s1 and s2 will result in three equal strings.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s1.length, s2.length, s3.length <= 100
// 	s1, s2 and s3 consist only of lowercase English letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When efficiently searching for all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text string, or when computing the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix for all its prefixes.
//   • Idea: The KMP algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern within a text by pre-processing the pattern to build a prefix function (LPS array), which avoids redundant character comparisons. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M) for text length N and pattern length M.
//   • Invariants: The prefix function array `pi` stores for each `i` the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i]`.; During prefix function computation for `pi[i]`, `j` always represents the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i-1]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i-1]`.
//   • Tips: Precompute the prefix function (LPS array) for the pattern to guide shifts.; Use two pointers: one for the text (or current character in pattern for prefix function), one for the pattern (or length of matched prefix).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating or using the prefix function values, leading to wrong shifts.; Off-by-one errors when indexing or shifting pointers, especially at boundaries.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
