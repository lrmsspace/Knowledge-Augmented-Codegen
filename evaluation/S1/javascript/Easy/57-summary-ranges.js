// Problem Description:
// You are given a sorted unique integer array nums.
//
// A range [a,b] is the set of all integers from a to b (inclusive).
//
// Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of nums is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer x such that x is in one of the ranges but not in nums.
//
// Each range [a,b] in the list should be output as:
//
//
// 	"a->b" if a != b
// 	"a" if a == b
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
// Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
// Explanation: The ranges are:
// [0,2] --> "0->2"
// [4,5] --> "4->5"
// [7,7] --> "7"
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= nums.length <= 20
// 	-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
// 	All the values of nums are unique.
// 	nums is sorted in ascending order.

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Range Minimum Query (array, ds, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the minimum element within specified ranges of an array efficiently, especially for many queries after initial setup.
//   • Idea: A Range Minimum Query (RMQ) problem asks to find the minimum value in a specified range [L, R] of an array. It can be solved with various data structures, often achieving O(1) or O(log N) query time after O(N log N) or O(N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: For any query range [L, R], the returned value is the minimum of elements A[i] where L <= i <= R.; The precomputed data structure correctly stores minimums for all relevant sub-intervals.
//   • Tips: For static arrays, Sparse Table offers O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.; For dynamic arrays (with updates), Segment Tree provides O(log N) query and update times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases for range boundaries (L, R).; High memory usage for Sparse Table if N is very large (N log N space).
// - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
//   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
//   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
//   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
