// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
//
// You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
//
// Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
//
// Example:
// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
// Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= prices.length <= 105
// 	0 <= prices[i] <= 104
//

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (heap, interval, greedy, simulation)
//   • When to use: When needing to find an optimal schedule for a set of jobs, each with a deadline and duration, typically to maximize completed jobs or minimize total lateness. This approach often involves processing jobs based on deadlines and dynamically selecting tasks.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal job schedule by processing jobs sorted by their deadlines, using a priority queue to manage available tasks. It greedily selects jobs with the shortest run-time that can be completed within the current time window, achieving an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs with deadlines greater than the current job's deadline have been considered.; The priority queue contains jobs that can potentially be scheduled within the current time window.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by deadline in descending order to process later deadlines first.; Use a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve the job with the least run-time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly sorting jobs (e.g., ascending deadline or by duration).; Not handling overlapping time intervals or deadlines properly.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items, each with a weight and value, to maximize total value within a limited capacity, where each item can be chosen multiple times. It is suitable for problems exhibiting optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack Problem involves selecting items to maximize total value within a fixed capacity. The complete knapsack variant, where items can be taken multiple times, is typically solved using dynamic programming in O(nW) time and O(W) space.
//   • Invariants: For 2D DP `f[i][j]`, it represents the maximum value obtainable using only the first `i` items with a total weight not exceeding `j`.; For 1D DP `dp[j]`, after processing item `i`, it stores the maximum value obtainable with a total weight not exceeding `j`, considering all items up to `i`.
//   • Tips: For the complete knapsack, iterate capacity `j` forwards (from `w_i` to `W`) when using 1D DP to allow multiple selections of the current item.; The 1D DP array `dp[j]` stores the maximum value achievable for exactly capacity `j`.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-1 knapsack with complete knapsack, especially in the 1D DP iteration direction for capacity.; Incorrectly initializing the DP array, leading to incorrect base cases or propagation.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
