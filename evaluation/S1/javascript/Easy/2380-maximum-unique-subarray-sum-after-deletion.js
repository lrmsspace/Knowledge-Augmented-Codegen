// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-unique-subarray-sum-after-deletion/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums.
//
// You are allowed to delete any number of elements from nums without making it empty. After performing the deletions, select a subarray of nums such that:
//
//
// 	All elements in the subarray are unique.
// 	The sum of the elements in the subarray is maximized.
//
//
// Return the maximum sum of such a subarray.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
//
// Output: 15
//
// Explanation:
//
// Select the entire array without deleting any element to obtain the maximum sum.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, ds, sliding-window, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when performing frequent range queries and point updates on an array, especially when a segment tree is too complex or memory-intensive, or when query types are diverse. It offers a balanced time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and point updates. It achieves O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations.
//   • Invariants: Each element `arr[i]` belongs to exactly one block `block[i / block_size]`.; The summary for each block `block_summary[j]` accurately reflects the state of elements within block `j`.
//   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for balanced performance.; Precompute block summaries (e.g., sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or boundaries.; Forgetting to update the block's summary after a point update.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (array, stack, monotonic-stack, max-window)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to find the largest rectangular submatrix composed entirely of zeros within a binary matrix. It efficiently reduces the 2D problem to a series of 1D largest rectangle in histogram problems.
//   • Idea: The algorithm transforms a 2D matrix problem into a series of 1D 'largest rectangle in histogram' problems, one for each row. It uses a monotonic stack to find the nearest smaller elements for each bar in O(N) time, leading to an overall O(N*M) complexity for the 2D problem.
//   • Invariants: The stack always stores indices of elements in strictly increasing order of their corresponding heights.; When an element is popped from the stack, the element below it is its nearest smaller element to the left.
//   • Tips: Precompute heights for each column, representing consecutive zeros upwards from the current row.; The 2D problem is effectively reduced to finding the largest rectangle in a histogram for each row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when using the stack (e.g., empty stack, end of array).; Off-by-one errors when calculating the width of the rectangle (k2 - k1 - 1).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
