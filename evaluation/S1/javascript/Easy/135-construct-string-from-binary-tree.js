//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:
//
//
// 	
// 	Node Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.
// 	
// 	
// 	Parentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:
//
// 	
// 		If a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.
// 		If a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.
// 	
// 	
// 	
// 	Omitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.
//
// 	In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
// Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
// Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to store ordered data that allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion while maintaining sorted order. It's suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(log N) average time and O(N) worst-case.
//   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than its key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than its key.
//   • Tips: Maintain the BST property: left child < parent < right child.; Recursion simplifies many operations like search, insert, and traversal.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade performance to O(N) for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can break BST properties or lead to data loss.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, tree, string, recursion)
//   • When to use: When needing to efficiently represent all substrings of a string and perform various string operations like counting occurrences, finding distinct substrings, or pattern matching. It is particularly useful for problems involving properties of all substrings or suffixes.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal deterministic finite automaton that accepts all suffixes of a given string. It efficiently encodes all substrings and their occurrences, typically constructed in O(N) time and space for a string of length N.
//   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton corresponds to a unique endpos set.; All substrings represented by a state are suffixes of the longest string in that state's endpos set.
//   • Tips: Understand the endpos equivalence classes and suffix links.; Construction is typically incremental, character by character.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of implementation can be high due to many edge cases.; Incorrectly handling suffix links during construction.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
