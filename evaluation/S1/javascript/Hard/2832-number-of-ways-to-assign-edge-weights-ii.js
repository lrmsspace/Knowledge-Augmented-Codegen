// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-assign-edge-weights-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, rooted at node 1. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi.
//
// Initially, all edges have a weight of 0. You must assign each edge a weight of either 1 or 2.
//
// The cost of a path between any two nodes u and v is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.
//
// You are given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[i] = [ui, vi], determine the number of ways to assign weights to edges in the path such that the cost of the path between ui and vi is odd.
//
// Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the number of valid assignments for queries[i].
//
// Since the answer may be large, apply modulo 109 + 7 to each answer[i].
//
// Note: For each query, disregard all edges not in the path between node ui and vi.
//
// Example:
// Input: edges = [[1,2]], queries = [[1,1],[1,2]]
//
// Output: [0,1]
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	Query [1,1]: The path from Node 1 to itself consists of no edges, so the cost is 0. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 0.
// 	Query [1,2]: The path from Node 1 to Node 2 consists of one edge (1 → 2). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 105
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i] == [ui, vi]
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	queries[i] == [ui, vi]
// 	1 <= ui, vi <= n
// 	edges represents a valid tree.

// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, binary-lifting, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use binary lifting when you need to answer multiple Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries or ancestor relationship checks efficiently on a static tree.
//   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestor pointers using DFS to answer Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries and ancestor checks in O(log N) time per query, after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` and power `k`, `up[u][k]` is the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; `depth[u]` correctly represents the distance from the root to node `u`.
//   • Tips: Precompute `up[u][k]` as the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; Use DFS to fill the `up` array and node depths.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating `log N` for array dimensions.; Failing to handle the root node's ancestors (e.g., `up[root][k]` should be itself or an invalid node).
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, matrix, matrix-exp, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count the number of paths of a specific length between all pairs of vertices in a graph, or to find reachability in a fixed number of steps.
//   • Idea: This algorithm leverages matrix exponentiation to find the number of paths of a fixed length `k` between all pairs of vertices in a graph. Each matrix multiplication step extends path lengths by one, resulting in an O(N^3 log K) time complexity for an N-vertex graph.
//   • Invariants: After `m` matrix multiplications, `C_m[i][j]` stores the number of paths of length `m` from `i` to `j`.; The initial adjacency matrix `G` remains constant throughout the exponentiation process.
//   • Tips: Represent the graph as an adjacency matrix where `G[i][j]` is the number of direct edges.; Matrix multiplication `C_k * G` yields `C_{k+1}` for path counts.
//   • Pitfalls: Standard matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to O(N^3 log K) overall time complexity.; Memory usage is O(N^2) for storing matrices, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs.
// - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, lca)
//   • When to use: Use this technique for efficiently answering multiple Range Minimum Queries on a static array, especially when an asymptotically optimal O(1) query time solution is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm solves the static Range Minimum Query problem by first constructing a Cartesian tree from the input array, then reducing RMQ queries to Lowest Common Ancestor queries on this tree. It achieves an optimal O(N) preprocessing time and O(1) query time.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the original array segment represented by `u`'s subtree.; The in-order traversal of the Cartesian tree nodes' original array indices yields the original array `A`'s indices in increasing order.
//   • Tips: Construct the Cartesian tree efficiently in O(N) time, typically using a stack-based approach.; The value of the LCA of two nodes in the Cartesian tree corresponds to the minimum in the original array range between their indices.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Cartesian tree, especially when handling duplicate values or edge cases like empty arrays.; The Farach-Colton and Bender LCA algorithm is complex to implement and often requires significant effort.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
