// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:
//
//
// 	If the length of the string is 1, stop.
// 	If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
// 	
// 		Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
// 		Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
// 		Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.
// 	
// 	
//
//
// Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
// Output: true
// Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
// "great" --> "gr/eat" // divide at random index.
// "gr/eat" --> "gr/eat" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
// "gr/eat" --> "g/r / e/at" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
// "g/r / e/at" --> "r/g / e/at" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
// "r/g / e/at" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide "at" to "a/t".
// "r/g / e/ a/t" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
// The algorithm stops now, and the result string is "rgeat" which is s2.
// As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.
//
// Constraints:
// s1.length == s2.length
// 	1 <= s1.length <= 30
// 	s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

// - String Sorts (array, string, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to sort a collection of strings lexicographically, especially when string lengths vary or are large, and the character set is limited.
//   • Idea: This algorithm sorts an array of strings lexicographically by recursively applying a counting sort-like distribution based on characters from most significant to least significant digit. It typically achieves O(N*L + R*L) time complexity, where N is the number of strings, L is the average string length, and R is the radix size.
//   • Invariants: All strings in the current `a[lo...hi]` sub-array share a common prefix of length `d`.; After the distribution pass for character `d`, `aux` contains strings from `a[lo...hi]` stably sorted by their `d`-th character.
//   • Tips: Use an auxiliary array for stable distribution during each pass to maintain relative order.; Implement a cutoff to insertion sort for small sub-arrays to improve performance due to lower overhead.
//   • Pitfalls: Can have high overhead for small N or short strings compared to comparison sorts.; Potentially memory intensive due to the auxiliary array and recursion stack depth proportional to max string length.
// - Introduction to Dynamic Programming (array, tree, recursion, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, and a natural recursive solution is inefficient due to redundant computations. It's ideal for transforming exponential recursive solutions into polynomial time.
//   • Idea: Top-down dynamic programming, or memoization, optimizes recursive solutions by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This technique typically reduces time complexity from exponential to polynomial, often O(N) or O(N*M).
//   • Invariants: memo[state] contains the computed result for 'state' if memo[state] is not the sentinel value.; If memo[state] is the sentinel value, the result for 'state' has not yet been computed.
//   • Tips: Initialize the memoization table with a sentinel value (e.g., -1, null) to distinguish uncomputed states from valid zero/false results.; Use arrays for lookup tables when the state space is contiguous and small for optimal cache performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the memoization table, leading to incorrect results or infinite loops.; Incorrectly identifying or handling base cases in the recursive function.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
