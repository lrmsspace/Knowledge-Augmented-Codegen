// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-largest-variance/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// The variance of a string is defined as the largest difference between the number of occurrences of any 2 characters present in the string. Note the two characters may or may not be the same.
//
// Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters only, return the largest variance possible among all substrings of s.
//
// A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "aababbb"
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// All possible variances along with their respective substrings are listed below:
// - Variance 0 for substrings "a", "aa", "ab", "abab", "aababb", "ba", "b", "bb", and "bbb".
// - Variance 1 for substrings "aab", "aba", "abb", "aabab", "ababb", "aababbb", and "bab".
// - Variance 2 for substrings "aaba", "ababbb", "abbb", and "babb".
// - Variance 3 for substring "babbb".
// Since the largest possible variance is 3, we return it.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 104
//  s consists of lowercase English letters.

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
