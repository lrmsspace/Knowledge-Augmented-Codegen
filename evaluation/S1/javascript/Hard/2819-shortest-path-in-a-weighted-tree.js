// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-weighted-tree/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n and an undirected, weighted tree rooted at node 1 with n nodes numbered from 1 to n. This is represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates an undirected edge from node ui to vi with weight wi.
//
// You are also given a 2D integer array queries of length q, where each queries[i] is either:
//
//
// 	[1, u, v, w'] – Update the weight of the edge between nodes u and v to w', where (u, v) is guaranteed to be an edge present in edges.
// 	[2, x] – Compute the shortest path distance from the root node 1 to node x.
//
//
// Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the shortest path distance from node 1 to x for the ith query of [2, x].
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 2, edges = [[1,2,7]], queries = [[2,2],[1,1,2,4],[2,2]]
//
// Output: [7,4]
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
//
// 	Query [2,2]: The shortest path from root node 1 to node 2 is 7.
// 	Query [1,1,2,4]: The weight of edge (1,2) changes from 7 to 4.
// 	Query [2,2]: The shortest path from root node 1 to node 2 is 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i] == [ui, vi, wi]
// 	1 <= ui, vi <= n
// 	1 <= wi <= 104
// 	The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
// 	1 <= queries.length == q <= 105
// 	queries[i].length == 2 or 4
// 	
// 		queries[i] == [1, u, v, w'] or,
// 		queries[i] == [2, x]
// 		1 <= u, v, x <= n
// 		(u, v) is always an edge from edges.
// 		1 <= w' <= 104

// - Segment Tree (tree, array, segment-tree, recursion, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: Use for efficient range queries and updates on an array. It handles aggregated information over dynamic intervals.
//   • Idea: A segment tree is a tree data structure used for storing information about intervals or segments. It allows answering range queries and range updates in logarithmic time, making it efficient for dynamic array problems.
//   • Invariants: Each node represents a contiguous segment of the original array.; The value stored in a parent node is an aggregation of its children's values.
//   • Tips: Build the tree recursively, dividing the array into halves.; Each node stores an aggregate value for its corresponding segment.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling array indexing (0-based vs 1-based).; Off-by-one errors in segment boundaries during queries/updates.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, deque, 01-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently computes single-source shortest paths, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
//   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds the single-source shortest paths in a graph where all edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1. It uses a deque to process nodes, achieving an optimal time complexity of O(V + E).
//   • Invariants: When a node 'u' is extracted from the front of the deque, 'dist[u]' is its shortest path from the source.; The deque always contains nodes whose distances are either 'D' or 'D+1', where 'D' is the distance of the last node extracted.
//   • Tips: Always push 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Push 1-weight edges to the back of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Pushing 0-weight edges to the back or 1-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Not correctly initializing distances or the source node.
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
