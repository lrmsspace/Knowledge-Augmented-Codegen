// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-2d-grid-matching-graph-layout/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array edges representing an undirected graph having n nodes, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes an edge between nodes ui and vi.
//
// Construct a 2D grid that satisfies these conditions:
//
//
// 	The grid contains all nodes from 0 to n - 1 in its cells, with each node appearing exactly once.
// 	Two nodes should be in adjacent grid cells (horizontally or vertically) if and only if there is an edge between them in edges.
//
//
// It is guaranteed that edges can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.
//
// Return a 2D integer array satisfying the conditions above. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
//
// Output: [[3,1],[2,0]]
//
// Explanation:
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= edges.length <= 105
// 	edges[i] = [ui, vi]
// 	0 <= ui < vi < n
// 	All the edges are distinct.
// 	The input is generated such that edges can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Multi source BFS (queue, graph, multi-source-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest distance from any of a given set of source nodes to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph or grid.
//   • Idea: Multi-source BFS explores a graph or grid by starting from multiple initial nodes simultaneously, finding the shortest path from any of these sources to all other reachable nodes. It operates in O(V + E) time for graphs or O(rows * cols) for grids.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same shortest distance level from any source.; When a node `u` is dequeued, `dist[u]` represents the finalized shortest distance from any source to `u`.
//   • Tips: Initialize distances for all sources to 0 and add them to the queue.; Use a `visited` array or set to prevent redundant processing of nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark initial sources as visited before adding to the queue.; Incorrectly initializing distances for non-source nodes (should be infinity or a large value).
// - Undirected Graphs (graph, array, simulation)
//   • When to use: When modeling symmetric relationships between entities and needing to explore, analyze connectivity, or find paths within the network. Useful for problems involving reachability or structural properties.
//   • Idea: Undirected graphs represent symmetric relationships between pairs of vertices. Simulation on them involves systematically exploring or processing these connections, often with O(V+E) complexity for basic traversals.
//   • Invariants: All vertices reachable from the source within 'k' edges have been processed by the 'k'-th step of BFS.; Each edge in the graph is traversed at most twice (once for each direction) during a full graph traversal.
//   • Tips: Use an adjacency list for sparse graphs to optimize space and traversal time.; Use an adjacency matrix for dense graphs or when O(1) edge existence checks are critical.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected components, leading to incomplete graph processing.; Incorrectly representing undirected edges (e.g., only adding one direction to an adjacency list).
// - Depth First Search (graph, dfs, topo)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable vertices from a starting point, find paths, detect cycles, or perform topological sorting on directed acyclic graphs.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically runs in O(V + E) time for graphs represented with adjacency lists, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: Every node is visited at most once.; The `visited` set accurately reflects nodes currently in the recursion stack or fully explored.
//   • Tips: Always use a visited set to avoid infinite loops in cyclic graphs.; For topological sort, add nodes to a list after visiting all their neighbors.
//   • Pitfalls: Risk of stack overflow for very deep graphs or trees.; Failing to mark nodes as visited before recursive calls can lead to re-processing.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
