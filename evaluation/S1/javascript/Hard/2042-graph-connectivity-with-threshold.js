// Problem Description:
// We have n cities labeled from 1 to n. Two different cities with labels x and y are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if x and y share a common divisor strictly greater than some threshold. More formally, cities with labels x and y have a road between them if there exists an integer z such that all of the following are true:
//
//
// 	x % z == 0,
// 	y % z == 0, and
// 	z > threshold.
//
//
// Given the two integers, n and threshold, and an array of queries, you must determine for each queries[i] = [ai, bi] if cities ai and bi are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).
//
// Return an array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no path.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
// Output: [false,false,true]
// Explanation: The divisors for each number:
// 1:   1
// 2:   1, 2
// 3:   1, 3
// 4:   1, 2, 4
// 5:   1, 5
// 6:   1, 2, 3, 6
// Using the underlined divisors above the threshold, only cities 3 and 6 share a common divisor, so they are the
// only ones directly connected. The result of each query:
// [1,4]   1 is not connected to 4
// [2,5]   2 is not connected to 5
// [3,6]   3 is connected to 6 through path 3--6
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 104
// 	0 <= threshold <= n
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	queries[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= ai, bi <= cities
// 	ai != bi

// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, tree, array, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and efficiently perform union operations to merge sets or find the representative of an element's set.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: finding the representative of an element's set and merging two sets. With path compression and union by rank/size, these operations achieve nearly constant amortized time complexity, O(alpha(N)).
//   • Invariants: Each element `v` is either a root (parent[v] == v) or has a parent pointer to another element in its set.; The `find_set` operation, after path compression, ensures that all nodes on the path from `v` to its root directly point to the root.
//   • Tips: Implement path compression in `find_set` for optimal performance.; Use union by rank or union by size to keep trees flat and balanced.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting path compression or union by rank/size leads to O(N) worst-case operations.; Incorrectly merging sets by only updating one root without considering the other's rank/size.
// - Continued fractions (number, enumeration, gcd)
//   • When to use: Use when seeking the best rational approximations of real numbers or solving certain Diophantine equations. It's also applied in number theory for analyzing properties of irrational numbers.
//   • Idea: Continued fractions represent a real number as a sum of an integer and the reciprocal of another number, recursively. This iterative process, based on the Euclidean algorithm, generates a sequence of best rational approximations.
//   • Invariants: The current convergent p_k / q_k is the best rational approximation for its denominator size.; The sequence of partial quotients a_i are integers, with a_i >= 1 for i > 0.
//   • Tips: Understand the relationship with the Euclidean algorithm for rational numbers.; Convergents provide the best rational approximations for a given denominator size.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating-point precision issues can significantly affect accuracy for real numbers.; Misinterpreting 'best approximation' as globally best, rather than best for a given denominator bound.
// - Finding Bridges Online (graph, ds, union-find, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when edges are added one by one to an initially empty graph and you need to efficiently track the number of bridges or 2-edge-connected components after each addition.
//   • Idea: This algorithm dynamically maintains the number of bridges in an undirected graph as edges are added incrementally. It leverages a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to achieve an amortized time complexity of O((N+M) log N).
//   • Invariants: Each DSU set represents a 2-edge-connected component or a collection of such components connected by bridges.; The total count of bridges accurately reflects edges whose removal increases connected components.
//   • Tips: Understand the properties of 2-edge-connected components and how they relate to bridges.; Carefully manage DSU operations, including path compression and union by rank/size, for optimal performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating the bridge count after an edge addition, especially when cycles are formed.; Inefficient DSU operations leading to a higher than expected time complexity.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
