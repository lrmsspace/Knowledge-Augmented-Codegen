// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-value-of-function-in-a-ball-passing-game/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array receiver of length n and an integer k. n players are playing a ball-passing game.
//
// You choose the starting player, i. The game proceeds as follows: player i passes the ball to player receiver[i], who then passes it to receiver[receiver[i]], and so on, for k passes in total. The game's score is the sum of the indices of the players who touched the ball, including repetitions, i.e. i + receiver[i] + receiver[receiver[i]] + ... + receiver(k)[i].
//
// Return the maximum possible score.
//
// Notes:
//
//
// 	receiver may contain duplicates.
// 	receiver[i] may be equal to i.
//
// Example:
// Input: receiver = [2,0,1], k = 4
//
// Output: 6
//
// Explanation:
//
// Starting with player i = 2 the initial score is 2:
//
//
// 	
// 		
// 			Pass
// 			Sender Index
// 			Receiver Index
// 			Score
// 		
// 		
// 			1
// 			2
// 			1
// 			3
// 		
// 		
// 			2
// 			1
// 			0
// 			3
// 		
// 		
// 			3
// 			0
// 			2
// 			5
// 		
// 		
// 			4
// 			2
// 			1
// 			6
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= receiver.length == n <= 105
// 	0 <= receiver[i] <= n - 1
// 	1 <= k <= 1010
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
//   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
//   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
