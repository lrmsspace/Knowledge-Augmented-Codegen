// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/stamping-the-grid/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an m x n binary matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (occupied).
//
// You are then given stamps of size stampHeight x stampWidth. We want to fit the stamps such that they follow the given restrictions and requirements:
//
//
// 	Cover all the empty cells.
// 	Do not cover any of the occupied cells.
// 	We can put as many stamps as we want.
// 	Stamps can overlap with each other.
// 	Stamps are not allowed to be rotated.
// 	Stamps must stay completely inside the grid.
//
//
// Return true if it is possible to fit the stamps while following the given restrictions and requirements. Otherwise, return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]], stampHeight = 4, stampWidth = 3
// Output: true
// Explanation: We have two overlapping stamps (labeled 1 and 2 in the image) that are able to cover all the empty cells.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[r].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 105
// 	1 <= m * n <= 2 * 105
// 	grid[r][c] is either 0 or 1.
// 	1 <= stampHeight, stampWidth <= 105

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
