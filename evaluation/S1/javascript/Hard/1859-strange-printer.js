// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/strange-printer/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:
//
//
// 	The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
// 	At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will cover the original existing characters.
//
//
// Given a string s, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "aaabbb"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 100
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters.

//   • When to use: When a problem involves finding an optimal value for a contiguous range of elements, and solutions for larger ranges can be derived by merging optimal solutions of smaller sub-ranges.
//   • Idea: An extension of dynamic programming where subproblems are defined over contiguous intervals, solving for dp[i][j] by iterating through all possible split points k within [i, j]. This often results in O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i][j] represents the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; When computing dp[i][j], all subproblems dp[x][y] where y - x + 1 < j - i + 1 are already solved.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.; Incorrect iteration order, leading to uncomputed subproblems.
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring within a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity for this task.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all maximal palindromic substrings centered at each position in a string by leveraging symmetry and previously computed results. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: d_odd[i] stores the radius of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.; The (l, r) interval always defines the rightmost palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with delimiters to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Maintain the current rightmost boundary `r` of the largest palindrome found.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update the `(l, r)` boundaries after processing each center.; Incorrectly calculating mirror positions or handling boundary cases for `i > r`.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
