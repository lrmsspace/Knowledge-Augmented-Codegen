// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome-after-substring-concatenation-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two strings, s and t.
//
// You can create a new string by selecting a substring from s (possibly empty) and a substring from t (possibly empty), then concatenating them in order.
//
// Return the length of the longest palindrome that can be formed this way.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "a", t = "a"
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
// Concatenating "a" from s and "a" from t results in "aa", which is a palindrome of length 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
//  s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

// - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences of a pattern in a text, analyzing string periodicity, or counting distinct substrings. It is especially useful for processing extremely long or recursively defined strings where explicit construction is impossible.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm leverages a precomputed prefix function (LPS array) to avoid redundant comparisons during string searching, achieving linear time complexity. The prefix function itself determines the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix, enabling various string property analyses in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: For any index `i`, `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i]`.; During prefix function computation, `j` always represents the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i-1]` that is also a suffix.
//   • Tips: The prefix function `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix.; Concatenate pattern, a unique separator, and text (`P + # + T`) to find all pattern occurrences.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors with array indexing or the precise definition of the prefix function.; Incorrectly handling the unique separator character in concatenated strings, leading to false matches.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
