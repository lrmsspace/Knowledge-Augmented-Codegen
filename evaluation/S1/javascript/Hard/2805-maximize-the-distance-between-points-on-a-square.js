//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer side, representing the edge length of a square with corners at (0, 0), (0, side), (side, 0), and (side, side) on a Cartesian plane.
//
// You are also given a positive integer k and a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinate of a point lying on the boundary of the square.
//
// You need to select k elements among points such that the minimum Manhattan distance between any two points is maximized.
//
// Return the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance between the selected k points.
//
// The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.
//
// Example:
// Input: side = 2, points = [[0,2],[2,0],[2,2],[0,0]], k = 4
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
// Select all four points.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= side <= 109
// 	4 <= points.length <= min(4 * side, 15 * 103)
// 	points[i] == [xi, yi]
// 	The input is generated such that:
// 	
// 		points[i] lies on the boundary of the square.
// 		All points[i] are unique.
// 	
// 	
// 	4 <= k <= min(25, points.length)

// - Convex Hull construction (geometry, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a plane. It is fundamental for various geometric algorithms and optimization problems.
//   • Idea: Convex hull construction identifies the subset of points that form the vertices of the smallest convex polygon containing all given points. Common algorithms achieve this in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sequence of points currently forming the hull maintains a convex property.; All points considered up to the current iteration are either part of the hull or lie within the polygon defined by the hull.
//   • Tips: Sort points by X-coordinate (and Y for ties) as a common preprocessing step.; Consider algorithms like Graham Scan or Monotone Chain for efficiency.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect orientation calculations.; Incorrectly handling collinear points can result in non-minimal hulls or errors.
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing a unimodal function (finding its maximum or minimum) over a continuous interval, where direct differentiation is hard or impossible.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a given interval by repeatedly narrowing the search space. It evaluates the function at two internal points to achieve logarithmic convergence.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function f(x) is always within the current interval [l, r].; The function f(x) remains unimodal within the current interval [l, r].
//   • Tips: Use a fixed number of iterations as a stopping criterion instead of an epsilon value for robustness against floating point errors.; For golden section search, reuse one function evaluation from the previous step to minimize expensive computations.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying this algorithm to a non-unimodal function will yield an incorrect result.; Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect comparisons or infinite loops if `eps` is too small.
// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
