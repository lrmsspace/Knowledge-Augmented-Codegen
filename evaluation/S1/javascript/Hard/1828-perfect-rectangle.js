// Problem Description:
// Given an array rectangles where rectangles[i] = [xi, yi, ai, bi] represents an axis-aligned rectangle. The bottom-left point of the rectangle is (xi, yi) and the top-right point of it is (ai, bi).
//
// Return true if all the rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
//
// Example:
// Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[3,2,4,4],[1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,4]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= rectangles.length <= 2 * 104
// 	rectangles[i].length == 4
// 	-105 <= xi < ai <= 105
// 	-105 <= yi < bi <= 105

// - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in order. It is efficient for both convex and non-convex polygons.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing signed trapezoidal areas formed by each edge and the x-axis, or equivalently, using the shoelace formula. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of vertices.
//   • Invariants: Vertices are processed sequentially in their given order, forming edges.; The running sum `current_sum` accumulates the signed contribution from each edge processed so far.
//   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in a consistent order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; Use a data type with sufficient range (e.g., long long or double) for intermediate sums to prevent overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect vertex order will result in an incorrect signed area or even zero.; Integer overflow can occur if coordinates are large and sums exceed standard integer limits.
// - Half-plane intersection (geometry, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the common region defined by a set of half-planes, or determine if such a region exists. It's particularly useful for checking if the intersection is empty.
//   • Idea: This method finds the intersection of N half-planes by checking all O(N^2) pairwise line intersections. Each intersection point is then verified against all N half-planes, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each candidate vertex is an intersection of two half-plane boundary lines.; Any point included in the final intersection region satisfies all given half-plane constraints.
//   • Tips: The vertices of the resulting convex polygon are always intersection points of the boundary lines.; Can be used to check if the intersection region is empty.
//   • Pitfalls: High time complexity of O(N^3) makes it inefficient for large N.; Numerical precision issues when calculating intersection points and checking containment.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
