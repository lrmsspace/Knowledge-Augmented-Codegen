// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-boxes/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive numbers.
//
// You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (i.e., composed of k boxes, k >= 1), remove them and get k * k points.
//
// Return the maximum points you can get.
//
// Example:
// Input: boxes = [1,3,2,2,2,3,4,3,1]
// Output: 23
// Explanation:
// [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1] 
// ----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
// ----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (1*1=1 points) 
// ----> [1, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
// ----> [] (2*2=4 points)
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= boxes.length <= 100
// 	1 <= boxes[i] <= 100
//

// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem involves finding an optimal value for a contiguous range of elements, and solutions for larger ranges can be derived by merging optimal solutions of smaller sub-ranges.
//   • Idea: An extension of dynamic programming where subproblems are defined over contiguous intervals, solving for dp[i][j] by iterating through all possible split points k within [i, j]. This often results in O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i][j] represents the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; When computing dp[i][j], all subproblems dp[x][y] where y - x + 1 < j - i + 1 are already solved.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.; Incorrect iteration order, leading to uncomputed subproblems.
// - Introduction to Dynamic Programming (array, tree, recursion, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, and a natural recursive solution is inefficient due to redundant computations. It's ideal for transforming exponential recursive solutions into polynomial time.
//   • Idea: Top-down dynamic programming, or memoization, optimizes recursive solutions by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This technique typically reduces time complexity from exponential to polynomial, often O(N) or O(N*M).
//   • Invariants: memo[state] contains the computed result for 'state' if memo[state] is not the sentinel value.; If memo[state] is the sentinel value, the result for 'state' has not yet been computed.
//   • Tips: Initialize the memoization table with a sentinel value (e.g., -1, null) to distinguish uncomputed states from valid zero/false results.; Use arrays for lookup tables when the state space is contiguous and small for optimal cache performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the memoization table, leading to incorrect results or infinite loops.; Incorrectly identifying or handling base cases in the recursive function.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
