// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-bst-in-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a binary tree root, return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).
//
// Assume a BST is defined as follows:
//
//
// 	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
// 	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
// 	Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]
// Output: 20
// Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in root node with key equal to 3.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 4 * 104].
// 	-4 * 104 <= Node.val <= 4 * 104
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Balanced Search Trees (tree, ds, binary-search, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to store a dynamic set of ordered data and require guaranteed logarithmic time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations, even in worst-case scenarios.
//   • Idea: Balanced search trees are a class of self-balancing binary search trees that maintain a logarithmic height to ensure O(log N) time complexity for core operations like search, insertion, and deletion. They achieve this balance through structural modifications such as rotations or node splitting/merging.
//   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are less than its key(s), and all keys in its right subtree are greater than its key(s).; The height of the tree is always proportional to log N, ensuring O(log N) operations.
//   • Tips: Understand the specific balancing rules (e.g., AVL rotations, Red-Black tree color properties, 2-3 tree node splits).; Consider the trade-offs between different balanced tree types (e.g., simpler implementation vs. stricter balance).
//   • Pitfalls: Implementation complexity can be high due to intricate rebalancing logic.; Overhead for rebalancing operations might be noticeable for very small N.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
