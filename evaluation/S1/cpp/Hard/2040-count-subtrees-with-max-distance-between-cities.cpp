// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subtrees-with-max-distance-between-cities/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There are n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are given an array edges of size n-1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge between cities ui and vi. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a tree.
//
// A subtree is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.
//
// For each d from 1 to n-1, find the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities in the subtree is equal to d.
//
// Return an array of size n-1 where the dth element (1-indexed) is the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to d.
//
// Notice that the distance between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4]]
// Output: [3,4,0]
// Explanation:
// The subtrees with subsets {1,2}, {2,3} and {2,4} have a max distance of 1.
// The subtrees with subsets {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {2,3,4} and {1,2,3,4} have a max distance of 2.
// No subtree has two nodes where the max distance between them is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 15
// 	edges.length == n-1
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= ui, vi <= n
// 	All pairs (ui, vi) are distinct.

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, counting, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Use when seeking the longest possible sequence of elements from a given array such that each element is greater than the preceding one, preserving their original relative order.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem identifies the longest possible subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order, preserving their original relative positions. It can be solved efficiently in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree.
//   • Invariants: The `tails` array elements are always strictly increasing.; For any index `k`, `tails[k]` holds the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `k+1`.
//   • Tips: Use a `tails` array to store the smallest ending element for LIS of each length.; Employ binary search on the `tails` array to update or extend subsequences.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence (relative order) with contiguous subarray.; Incorrectly implementing strict vs. non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, array, stack, bfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or traversing a graph level by level. It is suitable for exploring all reachable nodes from a source in increasing order of distance.
//   • Idea: Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the current depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph in O(V + E) time.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or adjacent depth level.; All 'marked' nodes have been visited, and their 'distTo' values are the shortest path from the source.
//   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit, ensuring level-by-level exploration.; Maintain a 'visited' array or set to prevent cycles and redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.; Incorrectly using a stack instead of a queue will result in Depth-First Search behavior.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
