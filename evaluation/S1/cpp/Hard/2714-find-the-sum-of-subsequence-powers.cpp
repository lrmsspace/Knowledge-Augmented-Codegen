// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-sum-of-subsequence-powers/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums of length n, and a positive integer k.
//
// The power of a subsequence is defined as the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the subsequence.
//
// Return the sum of powers of all subsequences of nums which have length equal to k.
//
// Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
//
// Output: 4
//
// Explanation:
//
// There are 4 subsequences in nums which have length 3: [1,2,3], [1,3,4], [1,2,4], and [2,3,4]. The sum of powers is |2 - 3| + |3 - 4| + |2 - 1| + |3 - 4| = 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n == nums.length <= 50
// 	-108 <= nums[i] <= 108 
// 	2 <= k <= n
//

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - Chinese Remainder Theorem (number, recursion, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a unique integer solution that satisfies a system of linear congruences with pairwise coprime moduli. It is used to reconstruct a number from its remainders modulo several divisors.
//   • Idea: The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) finds a unique solution x modulo the product of several pairwise coprime moduli, given a system of congruences. It typically involves computing modular inverses and combining solutions, with a complexity often dominated by modular exponentiation or extended Euclidean algorithm, usually O(N log M) or O(N log(max_modulus)).
//   • Invariants: The current combined solution 'x' satisfies 'x % m_i == a_i' for all congruences '(a_i, m_i)' processed so far.; The current combined modulus 'M' is the product of all individual moduli processed so far.
//   • Tips: Ensure all moduli are pairwise coprime for a unique solution.; Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find modular inverses.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if moduli are pairwise coprime.; Incorrectly calculating modular inverses.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
