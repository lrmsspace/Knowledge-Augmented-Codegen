// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-reward-using-operations-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array rewardValues of length n, representing the values of rewards.
//
// Initially, your total reward x is 0, and all indices are unmarked. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:
//
//
// 	Choose an unmarked index i from the range [0, n - 1].
// 	If rewardValues[i] is greater than your current total reward x, then add rewardValues[i] to x (i.e., x = x + rewardValues[i]), and mark the index i.
//
//
// Return an integer denoting the maximum total reward you can collect by performing the operations optimally.
//
// Example:
// Input: rewardValues = [1,1,3,3]
//
// Output: 4
//
// Explanation:
//
// During the operations, we can choose to mark the indices 0 and 2 in order, and the total reward will be 4, which is the maximum.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= rewardValues.length <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= rewardValues[i] <= 5 * 104
//

// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
//   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
//   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
