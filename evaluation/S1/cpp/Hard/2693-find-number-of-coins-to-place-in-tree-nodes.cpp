//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and rooted at node 0. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
//
// You are also given a 0-indexed integer array cost of length n, where cost[i] is the cost assigned to the ith node.
//
// You need to place some coins on every node of the tree. The number of coins to be placed at node i can be calculated as:
//
//
// 	If size of the subtree of node i is less than 3, place 1 coin.
// 	Otherwise, place an amount of coins equal to the maximum product of cost values assigned to 3 distinct nodes in the subtree of node i. If this product is negative, place 0 coins.
//
//
// Return an array coin of size n such that coin[i] is the number of coins placed at node i.
//
// Example:
// Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5]], cost = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
// Output: [120,1,1,1,1,1]
// Explanation: For node 0 place 6 * 5 * 4 = 120 coins. All other nodes are leaves with subtree of size 1, place 1 coin on each of them.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 2 * 104
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ai, bi < n
// 	cost.length == n
// 	1 <= |cost[i]| <= 104
// 	The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.

// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Minimum Spanning Trees (graph, greedy)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a subset of edges in a connected, edge-weighted graph that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight. Useful for network design problems where minimizing connection costs is crucial.
//   • Idea: A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm finds a subset of edges in an edge-weighted graph that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total weight, forming a tree. This is typically solved using greedy approaches with a time complexity often involving sorting edges or using a priority queue.
//   • Invariants: The set of edges selected so far always forms a forest.; Each connected component formed by the chosen edges is a valid subtree of some Minimum Spanning Tree.
//   • Tips: Greedy approaches often work by iteratively adding the cheapest valid edge or expanding from a starting vertex.; The cut property and cycle property are fundamental for proving correctness of MST algorithms.
//   • Pitfalls: Assuming the graph is always connected; disconnected graphs require finding a minimum spanning forest.; Incorrectly applying the greedy choice without ensuring it maintains the MST property (e.g., creating a cycle).
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
