//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
//
// Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.
//
// Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
//
// Example:
// Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
// Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= prices.length <= 105
// 	0 <= prices[i] <= 105
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
//   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
//   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
// - Convex hull trick and Li Chao tree (array, number, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when the optimal solution for a subproblem depends only on solutions to smaller, contiguous subproblems. It's effective for optimizing sequential decision-making or finding optimal values in arrays.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming 1D solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results to avoid recomputation. It typically achieves O(N) or O(N log N) time and O(N) or O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] correctly stores the optimal solution for the subproblem ending at index i.; All dp[j] for j < i have been computed and are correct.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the state: what does dp[i] represent for the subproblem?; Establish correct base cases for the smallest subproblems.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the state or recurrence relation.; Missing or incorrect base cases, leading to incorrect results.
// - Fibonacci Numbers (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use this when calculating the n-th Fibonacci number or similar sequences where each term depends on a fixed number of preceding terms. It efficiently avoids redundant computations for moderate 'n' values.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates Fibonacci numbers iteratively by storing previously computed values in an array, building up to the desired n-th term. This approach achieves O(N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] correctly stores the i-th Fibonacci number.; For i >= 2, dp[i] is computed as the sum of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2].
//   • Tips: Initialize base cases (F0, F1) correctly to start the sequence.; Use an array or two variables to store only the necessary previous terms.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the base cases can lead to wrong results.; A naive recursive solution without memoization will lead to exponential time complexity.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
