// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/painting-the-walls/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, cost and time, of size n representing the costs and the time taken to paint n different walls respectively. There are two painters available:
//
//
// 	A paid painter that paints the ith wall in time[i] units of time and takes cost[i] units of money.
// 	A free painter that paints any wall in 1 unit of time at a cost of 0. But the free painter can only be used if the paid painter is already occupied.
//
//
// Return the minimum amount of money required to paint the n walls.
//
// Example:
// Input: cost = [1,2,3,2], time = [1,2,3,2]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 1 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 3 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 2 and 3, free of cost in 2 units of time. Thus, the total cost is 1 + 2 = 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= cost.length <= 500
// 	cost.length == time.length
// 	1 <= cost[i] <= 106
// 	1 <= time[i] <= 500
//

// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and value, to maximize total value without exceeding a given capacity. It is applicable for resource allocation problems with discrete choices.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack Problem aims to choose items with maximum total value such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It is typically solved using dynamic programming, achieving a time complexity of O(nW) for n items and capacity W.
//   • Invariants: `dp[j]` (in 1D DP) represents the maximum value achievable with capacity `j` using items considered so far.; When processing item `i` and capacity `j` (decreasing `j`), `dp[j-weight_i]` holds the value from previous items for that reduced capacity.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP table with zeros for capacity 0 and unreachable states.; For 0-1 knapsack with 1D DP, iterate capacity `j` in decreasing order.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect iteration order for 1D DP in 0-1 knapsack (using increasing `j`).; Off-by-one errors in item indices or capacity calculations.
// - Shortest Paths (array, graph, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: To find the path with the minimum total weight or cost between two vertices, or from a single source to all other reachable vertices, in an edge-weighted graph.
//   • Idea: Shortest path algorithms determine the path with the least cumulative weight between nodes in a graph. This often involves a dynamic programming approach, iteratively updating minimum distances to achieve an optimal O(V*E) or O(E log V) complexity.
//   • Invariants: distTo[v] always stores the minimum path length from the source to v discovered so far.; For any edge u -> v, if distTo[u] is final, then distTo[v] will eventually be min(distTo[v], distTo[u] + weight(u,v)).
//   • Tips: Initialize the source distance to 0 and all other distances to infinity.; Use a `distTo` array to store the current shortest distances from the source.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to detect or handle negative cycles, which can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.; Incorrectly initializing distances or edge relaxation logic.
// - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem can be solved by making the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping this leads to a globally optimal solution. This strategy is often simpler and faster than dynamic programming.
//   • Idea: The greedy algorithm makes the best choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum, without reconsidering previous choices. Its time complexity is typically O(N log N) or O(N).
//   • Invariants: At each step, the chosen element is the best available according to the greedy criterion.; The partial solution constructed so far remains optimal for the subproblem considered.
//   • Tips: Prove correctness by exchange argument or induction.; Sort input data if it helps identify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to prove the greedy choice property.; Making a locally optimal choice that prevents a global optimum.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
