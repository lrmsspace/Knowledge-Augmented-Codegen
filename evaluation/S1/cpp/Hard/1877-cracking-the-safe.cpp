// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/cracking-the-safe/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be in the range [0, k - 1].
//
// The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.
//
//
// 	For example, the correct password is "345" and you enter in "012345":
//
// 	
// 		After typing 0, the most recent 3 digits is "0", which is incorrect.
// 		After typing 1, the most recent 3 digits is "01", which is incorrect.
// 		After typing 2, the most recent 3 digits is "012", which is incorrect.
// 		After typing 3, the most recent 3 digits is "123", which is incorrect.
// 		After typing 4, the most recent 3 digits is "234", which is incorrect.
// 		After typing 5, the most recent 3 digits is "345", which is correct and the safe unlocks.
// 	
// 	
//
//
// Return any string of minimum length that will unlock the safe at some point of entering it.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 1, k = 2
// Output: "10"
// Explanation: The password is a single digit, so enter each digit. "01" would also unlock the safe.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 4
// 	1 <= k <= 10
// 	1 <= kn <= 4096

// - Depth-first search (graph, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when exploring all reachable nodes from a starting point, detecting cycles, or performing a topological sort on a graph. It's suitable for problems requiring deep exploration before backtracking.
//   • Idea: Depth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically runs in O(V + E) time for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: For any visited node 'u', 'marked[u]' is true.; If a path exists from source 's' to 'v', then DFS from 's' will eventually mark 'v'.
//   • Tips: Use a 'visited' array or set to prevent infinite loops in cyclic graphs.; Maintain a 'parent' or 'edgeTo' array for path reconstruction or cycle detection.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow with deep recursion on large graphs.; Incorrectly handling cycles in undirected graphs without parent tracking.
// - Substring Search (string, array, kmp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern string within a larger text string efficiently. It is particularly useful when the pattern might have significant self-overlapping prefixes and suffixes, allowing for linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently searches for occurrences of a pattern within a text by avoiding redundant comparisons. It preprocesses the pattern to build a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) or Longest Proper Prefix Suffix (LPS) array, achieving O(N + M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: During DFA construction, dfa[c][j] correctly stores the next state if character c is encountered in state j.; During DFA construction, x maintains the length of the longest proper prefix of pattern[0...j-1] that is also a suffix of pattern[0...j-1].
//   • Tips: Precompute the LPS array or DFA for the pattern to guide the search.; The LPS array indicates the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix, enabling efficient shifts.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect construction of the LPS array or DFA is a common source of errors.; High constant factors for small alphabets or short patterns might make simpler algorithms faster.
// - Finding the Eulerian path in O(M) (graph, eulerian-circuit, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find a path or cycle that traverses every edge exactly once in a given graph. It's applicable when specific vertex degree conditions are met for path or cycle existence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm constructs an Eulerian path or cycle by first verifying vertex degree conditions and graph connectivity, then performing a recursive DFS-like traversal to build the path. It achieves a time complexity of O(M), where M is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: Every edge in the constructed path has been traversed exactly once.; All edges incident to the current vertex have been explored or are part of the remaining graph.
//   • Tips: Verify graph connectivity, ignoring isolated vertices.; For an Eulerian path, ensure exactly two vertices have odd degrees.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to check graph connectivity before starting.; Incorrectly counting odd degree vertices for path vs. cycle.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
