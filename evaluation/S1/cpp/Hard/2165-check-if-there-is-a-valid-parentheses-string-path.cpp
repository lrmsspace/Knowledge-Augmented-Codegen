//
// Problem Description:
// A parentheses string is a non-empty string consisting only of '(' and ')'. It is valid if any of the following conditions is true:
//
//
// 	It is ().
// 	It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid parentheses strings.
// 	It can be written as (A), where A is a valid parentheses string.
//
//
// You are given an m x n matrix of parentheses grid. A valid parentheses string path in the grid is a path satisfying all of the following conditions:
//
//
// 	The path starts from the upper left cell (0, 0).
// 	The path ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1).
// 	The path only ever moves down or right.
// 	The resulting parentheses string formed by the path is valid.
//
//
// Return true if there exists a valid parentheses string path in the grid. Otherwise, return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [["(","(","("],[")","(",")"],["(","(",")"],["(","(",")"]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: The above diagram shows two possible paths that form valid parentheses strings.
// The first path shown results in the valid parentheses string "()(())".
// The second path shown results in the valid parentheses string "((()))".
// Note that there may be other valid parentheses string paths.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 100
// 	grid[i][j] is either '(' or ')'.

// - Directed Graphs (graph, matrix, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine reachability between all pairs of vertices in a directed graph, especially for small or dense graphs where O(V*(V+E)) time is acceptable.
//   • Idea: This approach determines all-pairs reachability in a directed graph by performing a Depth-First Search starting from each vertex. It has a time complexity of O(V*(V+E)) and a space complexity of O(V^2).
//   • Invariants: For any vertex u, after its dedicated DFS completes, TC[u][v] is true for all v reachable from u.; The transitive closure matrix TC accurately reflects all-pairs reachability in the original graph.
//   • Tips: Initialize a boolean matrix to store reachability results.; For each vertex, perform a full DFS to mark all nodes reachable from it.
//   • Pitfalls: High time complexity O(V*(V+E)) makes it unsuitable for large sparse graphs.; High space complexity O(V^2) can be prohibitive for graphs with many vertices.
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: When asked to count the total number of valid or well-formed bracket sequences of a certain length or with a specific number of pairs. This often involves combinatorial reasoning or dynamic programming.
//   • Idea: Counts the total number of valid bracket sequences of a given length or with a specific number of pairs, where each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. This problem often has a combinatorial solution, typically involving Catalan numbers, with a time complexity of O(N) or O(N^2) for DP.
//   • Invariants: At any prefix of the sequence, the number of open brackets is greater than or equal to the number of closing brackets.; The total number of open brackets in the sequence equals the total number of closing brackets.
//   • Tips: Recognize the pattern for Catalan numbers if applicable.; Dynamic programming can be used for more complex variations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the balance constraint (open count >= close count).; Overcounting or undercounting sequences.
// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
