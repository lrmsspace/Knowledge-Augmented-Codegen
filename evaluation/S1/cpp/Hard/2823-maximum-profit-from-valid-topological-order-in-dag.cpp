//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, represented by a 2D array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates a directed edge from node ui to vi. Each node has an associated score given in an array score, where score[i] represents the score of node i.
//
// You must process the nodes in a valid topological order. Each node is assigned a 1-based position in the processing order.
//
// The profit is calculated by summing up the product of each node's score and its position in the ordering.
//
// Return the maximum possible profit achievable with an optimal topological order.
//
// A topological order of a DAG is a linear ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge u → v, node u comes before v in the ordering.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], score = [2,3]
//
// Output: 8
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
// Node 1 depends on node 0, so a valid order is [0, 1].
//
//

// 			Node

// 		
// 			1
// 			2nd
// 			3
// 			2
// 			3 × 2 = 6
// 		
// 	
//
//
// The maximum total profit achievable over all valid topological orders is 2 + 6 = 8.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == score.length <= 22
// 	1 <= score[i] <= 105
// 	0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
// 	edges[i] == [ui, vi] denotes a directed edge from ui to vi.
// 	0 <= ui, vi < n
// 	ui != vi
// 	The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
// 	There are no duplicate edges.

// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
// - Directed Graphs (graph, matrix, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine reachability between all pairs of vertices in a directed graph, especially for small or dense graphs where O(V*(V+E)) time is acceptable.
//   • Idea: This approach determines all-pairs reachability in a directed graph by performing a Depth-First Search starting from each vertex. It has a time complexity of O(V*(V+E)) and a space complexity of O(V^2).
//   • Invariants: For any vertex u, after its dedicated DFS completes, TC[u][v] is true for all v reachable from u.; The transitive closure matrix TC accurately reflects all-pairs reachability in the original graph.
//   • Tips: Initialize a boolean matrix to store reachability results.; For each vertex, perform a full DFS to mark all nodes reachable from it.
//   • Pitfalls: High time complexity O(V*(V+E)) makes it unsuitable for large sparse graphs.; High space complexity O(V^2) can be prohibitive for graphs with many vertices.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
