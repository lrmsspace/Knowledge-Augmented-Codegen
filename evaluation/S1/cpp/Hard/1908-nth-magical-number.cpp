//
// Problem Description:
// A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either a or b.
//
// Given the three integers n, a, and b, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
// Output: 2
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 109
// 	2 <= a, b <= 4 * 104
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When searching for a specific element in a sorted collection or finding an optimal value over a monotonic function within a defined range. It efficiently reduces the search space by half in each step.
//   • Idea: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or determines a value that satisfies a monotonic predicate. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The potential answer always lies within the current search interval `[low, high]`.; All elements strictly less than `low` have been determined not to be the answer.
//   • Tips: Ensure the search space exhibits a monotonic property.; Carefully define the `low` and `high` bounds for the search interval.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating `low` or `high` bounds leading to infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing or loop conditions.
// - Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (number, gcd)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the greatest common divisor of two or more integers, or as a subroutine for tasks like simplifying fractions or finding the least common multiple.
//   • Idea: The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log min(a, b)).
//   • Invariants: The greatest common divisor of the current pair (a, b) remains constant and equal to the GCD of the original inputs.; The second number (b) is always non-negative.
//   • Tips: Handle the base case where one of the numbers is zero; gcd(a, 0) = a.; The algorithm works for any order of inputs; if a < b, the first step swaps them effectively.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to take absolute values if negative inputs are possible, as GCD is typically defined for non-negative integers.; Incorrectly handling the zero input case, which can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (array, number, counting, sieve)
//   • When to use: Use when direct counting of elements satisfying specific conditions is difficult due to overlaps, and you need to find the count of elements satisfying at least one, exactly k, or none of several properties.
//   • Idea: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle counts the size of a union of sets by alternately adding and subtracting the sizes of intersections of increasing numbers of sets. Its complexity is often exponential in the number of properties.
//   • Invariants: At the start of processing subsets of size k, the running total correctly accounts for all intersections of size less than k.; For every element x, its contribution to the total sum is 1 if it satisfies the target condition, and 0 otherwise.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the properties (P1, P2, ..., Pn) for which elements are counted.; Systematically calculate the sizes of all relevant intersections of properties.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the properties or the universe of elements being counted.; Errors in calculating the sizes of specific intersections of properties.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
