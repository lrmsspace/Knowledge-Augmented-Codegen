// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-height-by-stacking-cuboids/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given n cuboids where the dimensions of the ith cuboid is cuboids[i] = [widthi, lengthi, heighti] (0-indexed). Choose a subset of cuboids and place them on each other.
//
// You can place cuboid i on cuboid j if widthi <= widthj and lengthi <= lengthj and heighti <= heightj. You can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another cuboid.
//
// Return the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.
//
// Example:
// Input: cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]
// Output: 190
// Explanation:
// Cuboid 1 is placed on the bottom with the 53x37 side facing down with height 95.
// Cuboid 0 is placed next with the 45x20 side facing down with height 50.
// Cuboid 2 is placed next with the 23x12 side facing down with height 45.
// The total height is 95 + 50 + 45 = 190.
//
// Constraints:
// n == cuboids.length
// 	1 <= n <= 100
// 	1 <= widthi, lengthi, heighti <= 100

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
