// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-pair-removal-to-sort-array-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array nums, you can perform the following operation any number of times:
//
//
// 	Select the adjacent pair with the minimum sum in nums. If multiple such pairs exist, choose the leftmost one.
// 	Replace the pair with their sum.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array non-decreasing.
//
// An array is said to be non-decreasing if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element (if it exists).
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	The pair (3,1) has the minimum sum of 4. After replacement, nums = [5,2,4].
// 	The pair (2,4) has the minimum sum of 6. After replacement, nums = [5,6].
//
//
// The array nums became non-decreasing in two operations.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to perform standard stack operations (push, pop) and also query the minimum element currently in the stack, all in constant time.
//   • Idea: Augments a standard stack by storing each element along with the minimum value encountered up to that point in the stack. This allows O(1) retrieval of the current minimum, while push and pop operations also remain O(1).
//   • Invariants: The top element's second component (minimum_so_far) always represents the minimum value currently in the entire stack.; For any element (value, min_so_far) in the stack, min_so_far is the minimum of 'value' and all elements below it.
//   • Tips: Store elements as pairs: (actual_value, minimum_at_this_level).; When pushing, the new minimum_at_this_level is min(new_value, stack.top().second) if stack is not empty, else new_value.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case when calculating the minimum for a new element.; Incorrectly assuming the minimum can be tracked with a single auxiliary variable without considering pops.
// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (array, heap, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when given a set of tasks with deadlines and durations, and the objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks without interruption.
//   • Idea: This greedy algorithm aims to maximize the number of jobs completed by prioritizing tasks that finish earliest. It typically involves sorting and using a min-heap, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed up to the current point have been considered for scheduling.; The set of jobs in the heap represents the jobs currently scheduled to meet their deadlines.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by their deadlines in ascending order.; Maintain a min-heap of durations for jobs currently scheduled.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing job count maximization with total duration or profit.; Failing to update the current time correctly after scheduling a job.
// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
