// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-nodes/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an undirected graph defined by an integer n, the number of nodes, and a 2D integer array edges, the edges in the graph, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between ui and vi. You are also given an integer array queries.
//
// Let incident(a, b) be defined as the number of edges that are connected to either node a or b.
//
// The answer to the jth query is the number of pairs of nodes (a, b) that satisfy both of the following conditions:
//
//
// 	a < b
// 	incident(a, b) > queries[j]
//
//
// Return an array answers such that answers.length == queries.length and answers[j] is the answer of the jth query.
//
// Note that there can be multiple edges between the same two nodes.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,4],[1,3],[2,3],[2,1]], queries = [2,3]
// Output: [6,5]
// Explanation: The calculations for incident(a, b) are shown in the table above.
// The answers for each of the queries are as follows:
// - answers[0] = 6. All the pairs have an incident(a, b) value greater than 2.
// - answers[1] = 5. All the pairs except (3, 4) have an incident(a, b) value greater than 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 2 * 104
// 	1 <= edges.length <= 105
// 	1 <= ui, vi <= n
// 	ui != vi
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 20
// 	0 <= queries[j] < edges.length

// - Counting labeled graphs (number, dp-2d, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: When counting the total number of labeled graphs with a specific number of vertices and connected components. Useful for problems requiring enumeration of graph structures based on their connectivity properties.
//   • Idea: This technique uses dynamic programming to count labeled graphs with a given number of vertices and connected components by building up solutions from smaller subproblems. It leverages a recurrence relation that considers the component containing a specific vertex, leading to an O(N^2 * K) time complexity for N vertices and K components.
//   • Invariants: D[i][j] correctly stores the number of labeled graphs with i vertices and j components.; All C_s values for s < n are correctly precomputed before calculating D[n][k].
//   • Tips: Precompute binomial coefficients for efficiency.; Precompute the number of connected graphs (C_s) for all relevant s.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for the dynamic programming table.; Off-by-one errors in binomial coefficient calculations or array indexing.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (array, number, counting, sieve)
//   • When to use: Use when direct counting of elements satisfying specific conditions is difficult due to overlaps, and you need to find the count of elements satisfying at least one, exactly k, or none of several properties.
//   • Idea: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle counts the size of a union of sets by alternately adding and subtracting the sizes of intersections of increasing numbers of sets. Its complexity is often exponential in the number of properties.
//   • Invariants: At the start of processing subsets of size k, the running total correctly accounts for all intersections of size less than k.; For every element x, its contribution to the total sum is 1 if it satisfies the target condition, and 0 otherwise.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the properties (P1, P2, ..., Pn) for which elements are counted.; Systematically calculate the sizes of all relevant intersections of properties.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the properties or the universe of elements being counted.; Errors in calculating the sizes of specific intersections of properties.
// - Edge connectivity / Vertex connectivity (graph, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Used to quantify a graph's resilience by finding the minimum number of edges or vertices whose removal disconnects it, or separates a specific pair of nodes.
//   • Idea: Edge connectivity is the minimum edges to disconnect a graph, while vertex connectivity is for vertices. Both are often computed using max-flow min-cut theorems, typically in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: The flow through any edge in the network does not exceed its capacity.; For any intermediate vertex (not source or sink), the total incoming flow equals the total outgoing flow.
//   • Tips: Edge connectivity between two specific vertices can be found using a max-flow min-cut algorithm.; To find global edge connectivity, iterate over all pairs of vertices or use specialized algorithms.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing edge connectivity (edges) with vertex connectivity (vertices) requirements.; Incorrectly applying max-flow for global connectivity without considering all relevant source-sink pairs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
