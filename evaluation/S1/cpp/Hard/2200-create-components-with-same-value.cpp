// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/create-components-with-same-value/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
//
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n where nums[i] represents the value of the ith node. You are also given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
//
// You are allowed to delete some edges, splitting the tree into multiple connected components. Let the value of a component be the sum of all nums[i] for which node i is in the component.
//
// Return the maximum number of edges you can delete, such that every connected component in the tree has the same value.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [6,2,2,2,6], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]] 
// Output: 2 
// Explanation: The above figure shows how we can delete the edges [0,1] and [3,4]. The created components are nodes [0], [1,2,3] and [4]. The sum of the values in each component equals 6. It can be proven that no better deletion exists, so the answer is 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
// 	nums.length == n
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 50
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1
// 	edges represents a valid tree.

// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer, typically by leveraging its prime factorization.
//   • Idea: The number of divisors d(n) and sum of divisors sigma(n) are arithmetic functions derived from the prime factorization of an integer n. Both can be computed efficiently by first finding prime factors and their exponents, resulting in an O(sqrt(N)) or O(log N) complexity with precomputed primes.
//   • Invariants: The current count of divisors is the product of (exponent + 1) for all prime factors found so far.; The current sum of divisors is the product of (1 + p + ... + p^e) for all prime factors found so far.
//   • Tips: Precompute primes using a sieve for efficiency when dealing with multiple queries or large numbers.; For sum of divisors, the formula is sigma(n) = product((1 + p_i + ... + p_i^e_i)) for each prime factor p_i^e_i.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle n=1 correctly, which has one divisor.; Integer overflow when calculating sums or products of large powers, especially for sum of divisors.
// - Minimum Spanning Trees (graph, greedy)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a subset of edges in a connected, edge-weighted graph that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight. Useful for network design problems where minimizing connection costs is crucial.
//   • Idea: A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm finds a subset of edges in an edge-weighted graph that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total weight, forming a tree. This is typically solved using greedy approaches with a time complexity often involving sorting edges or using a priority queue.
//   • Invariants: The set of edges selected so far always forms a forest.; Each connected component formed by the chosen edges is a valid subtree of some Minimum Spanning Tree.
//   • Tips: Greedy approaches often work by iteratively adding the cheapest valid edge or expanding from a starting vertex.; The cut property and cycle property are fundamental for proving correctness of MST algorithms.
//   • Pitfalls: Assuming the graph is always connected; disconnected graphs require finding a minimum spanning forest.; Incorrectly applying the greedy choice without ensuring it maintains the MST property (e.g., creating a cycle).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
