// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
//
// If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
//
// Example:
// Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
// Output: "fl"
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= strs.length <= 200
// 	0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
// 	strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Suffix array (array, tree, string, suffix-array, tree-dp, lca)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to perform fast substring searches, pattern matching, or other string operations on a fixed text, especially when space efficiency is critical compared to suffix trees.
//   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing only their starting indices. It is often paired with an LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array to enable efficient string algorithms, typically achieving O(N log N) or O(N) construction and O(M + log N) or O(M) search complexity.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `A` stores indices such that `S[A[i]:]` is lexicographically smaller than `S[A[i+1]:]` for all valid `i`.; The `lcp[i]` value represents the length of the longest common prefix between `S[A[i-1]:]` and `S[A[i]:]`.
//   • Tips: Pair with an LCP array to significantly speed up pattern searching and other string queries.; Consider Enhanced Suffix Arrays (ESA) for improved space and time efficiency over suffix trees, especially for large datasets.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive pattern searching without LCP information can be O(M log N), which might be too slow for long patterns.; Construction can be complex to implement efficiently in linear time.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
