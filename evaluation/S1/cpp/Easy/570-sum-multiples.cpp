// Problem Description:
// Given a positive integer n, find the sum of all integers in the range [1, n] inclusive that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.
//
// Return an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 7
// Output: 21
// Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7. The sum of these numbers is 21.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 103

// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (array, number, counting, sieve)
//   • When to use: Use when direct counting of elements satisfying specific conditions is difficult due to overlaps, and you need to find the count of elements satisfying at least one, exactly k, or none of several properties.
//   • Idea: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle counts the size of a union of sets by alternately adding and subtracting the sizes of intersections of increasing numbers of sets. Its complexity is often exponential in the number of properties.
//   • Invariants: At the start of processing subsets of size k, the running total correctly accounts for all intersections of size less than k.; For every element x, its contribution to the total sum is 1 if it satisfies the target condition, and 0 otherwise.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the properties (P1, P2, ..., Pn) for which elements are counted.; Systematically calculate the sizes of all relevant intersections of properties.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the properties or the universe of elements being counted.; Errors in calculating the sizes of specific intersections of properties.
// - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all integer solutions (x, y) for a linear equation of the form ax + by = c, or to determine if such solutions exist. It is also applicable for enumerating solutions within specified bounds.
//   • Idea: This method finds all integer solutions (x, y) to the linear equation ax + by = c. It utilizes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution, then generates the general solution set using properties of the greatest common divisor in O(log(min(a,b))) time.
//   • Invariants: The equation a * x + b * y = c holds true for any generated integer solution (x, y).; For integer solutions to exist, c must be perfectly divisible by gcd(a, b).
//   • Tips: Always check if c is divisible by gcd(a, b); if not, no integer solutions exist.; Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution (x0, y0) for ax + by = gcd(a, b).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to verify that c is a multiple of gcd(a, b) before proceeding.; Incorrectly scaling the particular solution obtained from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to efficiently calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer. It is applicable in number theory problems or combinatorial tasks involving factors.
//   • Idea: This method computes the number of divisors and sum of divisors of an integer n by first finding its prime factorization. The core idea leverages properties of multiplicative functions, with a typical complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for factorization.
//   • Invariants: During prime factorization, temp_n always holds the remaining unfactored part of the original number.; The current_prime_factor iterates through potential prime divisors in increasing order.
//   • Tips: First find the prime factorization n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak.; Number of divisors d(n) = (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the special case of n=1 (1 divisor, sum 1).; Incorrectly calculating powers or sums, especially for large exponents.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
