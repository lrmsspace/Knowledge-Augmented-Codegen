// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-tag-for-video-caption/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string caption representing the caption for a video.
//
// The following actions must be performed in order to generate a valid tag for the video:
//
//
// 	
// 	Combine all words in the string into a single camelCase string prefixed with '#'. A camelCase string is one where the first letter of all words except the first one is capitalized. All characters after the first character in each word must be lowercase.
// 	
// 	
// 	Remove all characters that are not an English letter, except the first '#'.
// 	
// 	
// 	Truncate the result to a maximum of 100 characters.
// 	
//
//
// Return the tag after performing the actions on caption.
//
// Example:
// Input: caption = "Leetcode daily streak achieved"
//
// Output: "#leetcodeDailyStreakAchieved"
//
// Explanation:
//
// The first letter for all words except "leetcode" should be capitalized.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= caption.length <= 150
// 	caption consists only of English letters and ' '.

// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to iterate through all possible submasks of a given bitmask efficiently, typically for problems involving subsets or combinations represented by bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks of a given bitmask in descending order using a clever bitwise trick. It processes each submask in O(1) time, leading to an overall complexity of O(2^k) where k is the number of set bits in the original mask.
//   • Invariants: Each `s` generated is a valid submask of the original mask `m`.; The value of `s` strictly decreases in each iteration until it reaches 0 (or the loop terminates).
//   • Tips: Always consider processing the submask 0 separately if it's a valid case for your problem.; The iteration naturally generates submasks in strictly descending numerical order.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting that the standard loop structure `for (int s = m; s > 0; s = (s - 1) & m)` omits submask 0.; Incorrectly assuming the iteration order is ascending; it is always descending.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
