// Problem Description:
// Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
//
// Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.
//
// Example:
// Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
// Output: true
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
// 	-104 <= Node.val <= 104
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, tree, array, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently manage a collection of disjoint sets, supporting operations to merge sets and determine if two elements belong to the same set.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that maintains a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: union (merging two sets) and find (determining the representative of an element's set). With path compression and union by rank/size, operations achieve nearly O(1) amortized time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any element `v`, `parent[v]` is either `v` itself (if `v` is a root) or an ancestor of `v`.; All elements belonging to the same set share a common root representative.
//   • Tips: Apply path compression during `find_set` to optimize future queries.; Utilize union by rank or size to maintain balanced trees.
//   • Pitfalls: Omitting path compression or union by rank/size results in poor performance.; Failing to correctly identify the root of a set in `find_set`.
// - Search for connected components in a graph (stack, graph, dfs, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when the goal is to identify distinct groups of interconnected nodes within a graph, or to find all nodes reachable from a specific starting point.
//   • Idea: Depth-First Search (DFS) explores a graph by traversing as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It efficiently finds connected components by visiting all reachable nodes from an unvisited starting point, typically with O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes in the current DFS path from the start node to the current node are on the recursion stack.; Any node marked as visited will not be re-processed by the current DFS call.
//   • Tips: Maintain a 'visited' status for each node to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Iterate through all nodes and start DFS if a node is unvisited to find all components.
//   • Pitfalls: Excessive recursion depth can lead to stack overflow errors for large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited results in infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
