// Problem Description:
// A string s is nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that s contains, it appears both in uppercase and lowercase. For example, "abABB" is nice because 'A' and 'a' appear, and 'B' and 'b' appear. However, "abA" is not because 'b' appears, but 'B' does not.
//
// Given a string s, return the longest substring of s that is nice. If there are multiple, return the substring of the earliest occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "YazaAay"
// Output: "aAa"
// Explanation: "aAa" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s, and both 'A' and 'a' appear.
// "aAa" is the longest nice substring.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 100
// 	s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all palindromic substrings within a given string, or determine the longest palindromic substring, in optimal linear time.
//   • Idea: Manacher's Algorithm efficiently finds the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at each position in a given string, handling both odd and even lengths uniformly via preprocessing. It achieves this in optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: p[i] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at i in the transformed string.; The right_boundary always marks the rightmost extent of the largest palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with a unique delimiter to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage the mirror property around the current center to initialize palindrome radii.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when converting `p` array values back to original string indices or lengths.; Incorrectly handling the boundaries of the preprocessed string.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently represent all distinct substrings of a string, or perform various string operations like counting unique substrings, finding occurrences, or string matching in an online fashion.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a powerful data structure that represents all distinct substrings of a given string in a compact form, typically as a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG). It can be constructed in linear time O(N) and space O(N) for a string of length N.
//   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end-positions in the original string.; For any state `v`, `len(v)` is the length of the longest string represented by `v`.
//   • Tips: Understand the properties of `len` (length of the longest string in a state) and `link` (suffix link to the longest proper suffix).; The construction is online, processing characters one by one from left to right.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `link` updates, especially when cloning states during construction.; Forgetting to update the `last` pointer after each character addition step.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
