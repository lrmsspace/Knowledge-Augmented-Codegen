// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-tested-devices-after-test-operations/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array batteryPercentages having length n, denoting the battery percentages of n 0-indexed devices.
//
// Your task is to test each device i in order from 0 to n - 1, by performing the following test operations:
//
//
// 	If batteryPercentages[i] is greater than 0:
//
// 	
// 		Increment the count of tested devices.
// 		Decrease the battery percentage of all devices with indices j in the range [i + 1, n - 1] by 1, ensuring their battery percentage never goes below 0, i.e, batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1).
// 		Move to the next device.
// 	
// 	
// 	Otherwise, move to the next device without performing any test.
//
//
// Return an integer denoting the number of devices that will be tested after performing the test operations in order.
//
// Example:
// Input: batteryPercentages = [1,1,2,1,3]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:
// At device 0, batteryPercentages[0] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,2].
// At device 1, batteryPercentages[1] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
// At device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,1].
// At device 3, batteryPercentages[3] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
// At device 4, batteryPercentages[4] > 0, so there are now 3 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.
// So, the answer is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == batteryPercentages.length <= 100 
// 	0 <= batteryPercentages[i] <= 100

// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (heap, interval, greedy, simulation)
//   • When to use: When needing to find an optimal schedule for a set of jobs, each with a deadline and duration, typically to maximize completed jobs or minimize total lateness. This approach often involves processing jobs based on deadlines and dynamically selecting tasks.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal job schedule by processing jobs sorted by their deadlines, using a priority queue to manage available tasks. It greedily selects jobs with the shortest run-time that can be completed within the current time window, achieving an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs with deadlines greater than the current job's deadline have been considered.; The priority queue contains jobs that can potentially be scheduled within the current time window.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by deadline in descending order to process later deadlines first.; Use a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve the job with the least run-time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly sorting jobs (e.g., ascending deadline or by duration).; Not handling overlapping time intervals or deadlines properly.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Simulated Annealing (array, number, randomized, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when seeking a near-optimal solution for complex optimization problems with many local optima, especially when exact solutions are computationally infeasible or too slow.
//   • Idea: Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic metaheuristic for global optimization, inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It explores the search space by accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time, aiming to escape local optima.
//   • Invariants: The `s_best` state always represents the lowest energy found across all iterations so far.; The temperature `T` is always non-negative and decreases monotonically with each iteration.
//   • Tips: Start with a sufficiently high initial temperature to allow broad exploration.; Choose a slow cooling schedule (decay rate) for better solution quality, at the cost of longer runtime.
//   • Pitfalls: Getting stuck in local minima if the cooling schedule is too fast.; Excessive runtime if the cooling schedule is too slow or initial temperature is too high.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
