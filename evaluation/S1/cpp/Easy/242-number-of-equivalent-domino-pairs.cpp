// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-equivalent-domino-pairs/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] = [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] = [c, d] if and only if either (a == c and b == d), or (a == d and b == c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.
//
// Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].
//
// Example:
// Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
// Output: 1
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= dominoes.length <= 4 * 104
// 	dominoes[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= dominoes[i][j] <= 9

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, counting, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when counting non-attacking piece placements on a grid, especially when the problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems based on board properties like diagonals.
//   • Idea: This algorithm employs 2D dynamic programming to count the total number of ways to place non-attacking bishops on a chessboard. It leverages the independence of placements on black and white squares/diagonals, achieving a polynomial time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any diagonal `i`, `D[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonal `i`.; Bishops placed on black diagonals do not attack bishops placed on white diagonals.
//   • Tips: Decompose the problem into independent subproblems for black and white squares/diagonals.; Identify the state for DP, typically `dp[diagonal_index][bishops_placed]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the number of squares on each diagonal.; Overlapping bishops if diagonal definitions are not precise.
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total number of valid arrangements of opening and closing brackets, ensuring all pairs are matched and correctly nested. It applies to combinatorial problems requiring structured pairing.
//   • Idea: This technique counts the number of ways to form sequences of opening and closing brackets such that they are balanced and properly nested. It is a classic combinatorial problem, typically solved in O(N) or O(N^2) time.
//   • Invariants: At any point in sequence construction, the count of open brackets placed must be greater than or equal to the count of closed brackets placed.; The total number of open brackets in a complete valid sequence must exactly equal the total number of closed brackets.
//   • Tips: Recognize the connection to Catalan numbers for common variations (e.g., N pairs of parentheses).; Dynamic programming can solve more complex variations with different bracket types or constraints.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the 'prefix sum' condition: the count of open brackets must always be greater than or equal to close brackets at any point.; Incorrectly applying Catalan numbers to problems with additional constraints or different bracket types.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
