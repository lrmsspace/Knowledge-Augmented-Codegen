//
// Problem Description:
// Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
//
// Example:
// Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
// Output: 0
// Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
// The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
// 	haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

// - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare strings or substrings, especially in scenarios involving large texts or numerous comparisons. It's also useful for pattern matching and detecting duplicates in collections of strings.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string into a numerical value (hash) to enable fast comparisons and lookups. This technique typically uses polynomial hashing with a base and a modulus, offering O(L) for initial hash computation and O(1) for substring hashes after O(N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: The hash of a string S of length L is (S[0]*P^(L-1) + S[1]*P^(L-2) + ... + S[L-1]*P^0) % M.; For any substring S[i...j], its hash can be derived from precomputed prefix hashes in O(1) time.
//   • Tips: Use multiple hash functions with different bases and moduli to reduce collision probability.; Choose a large prime modulus (e.g., 10^9 + 7) and a random base for robustness.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions are possible; always verify equality for critical applications or use multiple hashes.; Choosing a small or non-prime modulus significantly increases the risk of collisions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
