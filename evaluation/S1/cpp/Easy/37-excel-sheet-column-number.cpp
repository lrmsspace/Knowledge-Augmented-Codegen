// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-number/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string columnTitle that represents the column title as appears in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.
//
// For example:
//
//
// A -> 1
// B -> 2
// C -> 3
// ...
// Z -> 26
// AA -> 27
// AB -> 28 
// ...
//
// Example:
// Input: columnTitle = "A"
// Output: 1
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= columnTitle.length <= 7
// 	columnTitle consists only of uppercase English letters.
// 	columnTitle is in the range ["A", "FXSHRXW"].

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Finding the rank of a matrix (matrix, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix. It's also applicable for understanding the dimension of the vector space spanned by the matrix's rows or columns.
//   • Idea: Determines the rank of a matrix by transforming it into row echelon form using Gaussian elimination. The rank is the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form, with a time complexity of O(N^3).
//   • Invariants: The number of non-zero rows processed so far equals the current rank.; All elements below the pivot in the current column are zeroed out.
//   • Tips: Always choose the largest absolute value pivot for numerical stability.; Swap rows to bring a non-zero element to the pivot position.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect zero checks.; Forgetting to increment rank only when a valid pivot is found.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: When needing to efficiently represent all substrings of a given string and perform various string operations like counting distinct substrings, finding occurrences, or checking for specific patterns. It provides a compact and powerful data structure for complex string problems.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal deterministic finite automaton that recognizes all suffixes of a given string. It compactly represents all substrings of the string, with each state corresponding to an endpos-equivalence class, and can be constructed in linear time O(N).
//   • Invariants: Every state corresponds to a unique endpos-equivalence class of substrings.; For any state, all substrings ending at its endpos set are represented by that state or its ancestors via suffix links.
//   • Tips: Focus on the endpos definition for state equivalence.; Understand the incremental construction process.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm is non-trivial and prone to off-by-one errors.; Misinterpreting the role of suffix links vs. transition links.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
