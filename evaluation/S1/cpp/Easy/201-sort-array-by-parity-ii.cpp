//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers nums, half of the integers in nums are odd, and the other half are even.
//
// Sort the array so that whenever nums[i] is odd, i is odd, and whenever nums[i] is even, i is even.
//
// Return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [4,2,5,7]
// Output: [4,5,2,7]
// Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
// 	nums.length is even.
// 	Half of the integers in nums are even.
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
//

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Quicksort (array, two-pointers, randomized)
//   • When to use: Use Quicksort for efficient in-place sorting of arrays, especially when average-case performance and cache efficiency are prioritized. It is suitable for large datasets where memory usage is a concern.
//   • Idea: Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot element, then recursively sorts the two resulting subarrays. Its average time complexity is O(N log N), but can degrade to O(N^2) in the worst case.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the `lt` pointer are less than the pivot value.; All elements to the right of the `gt` pointer are greater than the pivot value.
//   • Tips: Randomly shuffle the input or choose a random pivot to ensure average-case performance.; Employ 3-way partitioning to efficiently handle duplicate keys and avoid quadratic worst-case scenarios.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to handle duplicate keys can lead to quadratic time complexity.; Incorrect pointer crossing logic can cause infinite loops or array out-of-bounds errors.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
//   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
//   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
