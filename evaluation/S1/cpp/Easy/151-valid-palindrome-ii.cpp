//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "aba"
// Output: true
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
// - Check if two segments intersect (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this when determining if two line segments in a 2D plane share any common points, especially when floating-point precision issues need to be avoided.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect by handling collinear and non-collinear cases separately, primarily using integer arithmetic to avoid precision errors. It typically runs in O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: If segments are collinear, their 1D projections on both axes must overlap for intersection.; If segments are not collinear, each segment's endpoints must lie on opposite sides of the line containing the other segment.
//   • Tips: Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.; Utilize cross products for efficient orientation checks.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly identify and handle collinear segments.; Introducing floating-point errors by using division for slopes.
// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
