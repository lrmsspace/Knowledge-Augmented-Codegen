// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-integer-added-to-array-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two arrays of equal length, nums1 and nums2.
//
// Each element in nums1 has been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable x.
//
// As a result, nums1 becomes equal to nums2. Two arrays are considered equal when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.
//
// Return the integer x.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [2,6,4], nums2 = [9,7,5]
//
// Output: 3
//
// Explanation:
//
// The integer added to each element of nums1 is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums1.length == nums2.length <= 100
// 	0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
// 	The test cases are generated in a way that there is an integer x such that nums1 can become equal to nums2 by adding x to each element of nums1.

// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, interval, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find or count all integer solutions (x, y) for a linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, especially when solutions are constrained within specific intervals for x and y.
//   • Idea: This method finds all integer solutions to a linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c within given x and y intervals. It first finds a particular solution, then uses properties of the general solution to determine the valid range for x, and enumerates solutions in O(N) time where N is the number of solutions.
//   • Invariants: The current (x, y) pair always satisfies the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c.; The current x value is an integer and satisfies the effective bounds l_x <= x <= r_x.
//   • Tips: Pre-divide coefficients a, b, c by gcd(a, b) to simplify the equation.; Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find an initial particular solution (x0, y0).
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to check if c is divisible by gcd(a, b) before proceeding, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly applying the shifting logic for x and y bounds, resulting in an invalid solution range.
// - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When efficiently searching for all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text string, or when computing the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix for all its prefixes.
//   • Idea: The KMP algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern within a text by pre-processing the pattern to build a prefix function (LPS array), which avoids redundant character comparisons. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M) for text length N and pattern length M.
//   • Invariants: The prefix function array `pi` stores for each `i` the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i]`.; During prefix function computation for `pi[i]`, `j` always represents the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i-1]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i-1]`.
//   • Tips: Precompute the prefix function (LPS array) for the pattern to guide shifts.; Use two pointers: one for the text (or current character in pattern for prefix function), one for the pattern (or length of matched prefix).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating or using the prefix function values, leading to wrong shifts.; Off-by-one errors when indexing or shifting pointers, especially at boundaries.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    int addedInteger(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {

        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // Calculate the difference between the first elements
        int x = nums2[0] - nums1[0];

        // Verify that the same difference applies to all elements
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums2[i] - nums1[i] != x) {
                // According to the problem statement, this should not happen
                // as there is guaranteed to be an integer x that works.
                return 0; // or throw an exception
