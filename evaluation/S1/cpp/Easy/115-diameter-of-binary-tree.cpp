//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
//
// The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
//
// The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, array, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path or minimum number of edges between nodes in an unweighted graph, or to explore a graph layer by layer. It is also suitable for finding shortest cycles or identifying all components of shortest paths.
//   • Idea: Breadth-first search systematically explores a graph level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of edges is found from a source node to all reachable nodes. It operates in O(V + E) time complexity for adjacency list representation.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at depth `k` or `k+1` from the source.; The distance recorded for any visited node is its shortest path length from the source.
//   • Tips: Run multiple BFS from different sources to find global properties like shortest cycles.; Maintain a distance array to record the shortest path length from the source to each node.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying BFS directly to weighted graphs will not yield shortest paths.; Failing to mark visited nodes can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs or incorrect path lengths.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
