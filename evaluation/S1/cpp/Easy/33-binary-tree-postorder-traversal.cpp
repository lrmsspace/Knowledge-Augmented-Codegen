// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
//
// Output: [3,2,1]
//
// Explanation:
//
// Constraints:
// The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
// 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Depth-first search (graph, array, stack, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS when you need to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, detect cycles, or perform topological sorting in a graph. It is suitable for problems requiring deep exploration before backtracking.
//   • Idea: Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically running in O(V + E) time for graphs.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently on the recursion stack (or explicit stack) are part of the current path from the source.; Once a node `v` is marked `visited`, it will not be processed again by the main traversal logic.
//   • Tips: Use a `visited` array or set to track explored nodes.; Pass the parent node in recursive calls to correctly detect cycles.
//   • Pitfalls: Risk of stack overflow for very deep graphs with recursive implementations.; Failure to use a `visited` array leads to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, stack, simulation, monotonic-stack)
//   • When to use: This technique is used to answer Range Minimum Queries efficiently on a static array by transforming them into Lowest Common Ancestor queries on a Cartesian Tree.
//   • Idea: This approach solves Range Minimum Query problems by constructing a Cartesian Tree from the input array, where the root of any subtree is its minimum element. RMQ for a given range then reduces to finding the Lowest Common Ancestor of the range's endpoints in this tree, allowing O(N) construction and O(1) query time after O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian Tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the subtree rooted at `u`.; For any node `u`, all nodes in its left subtree have indices smaller than `index(u)`, and all nodes in its right subtree have indices larger than `index(u)`.
//   • Tips: A Cartesian Tree is a binary tree where each node's value is less than its children's values, and an in-order traversal yields the original array.; Utilize a monotonic stack to construct the Cartesian Tree in linear O(N) time.
//   • Pitfalls: Correctly implementing the monotonic stack for Cartesian Tree construction can be challenging.; Edge cases, such as an empty stack or handling the last elements during tree building, must be managed carefully.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
