// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/advantage-shuffle/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 both of the same length. The advantage of nums1 with respect to nums2 is the number of indices i for which nums1[i] > nums2[i].
//
// Return any permutation of nums1 that maximizes its advantage with respect to nums2.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [2,7,11,15], nums2 = [1,10,4,11]
// Output: [2,11,7,15]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums1.length <= 105
// 	nums2.length == nums1.length
// 	0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
//   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
//   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
