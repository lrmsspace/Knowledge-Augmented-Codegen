// Problem Description:
// An array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.
//
// You are given an array of integer nums and a 2D integer matrix queries, where for queries[i] = [fromi, toi] your task is to check that subarray nums[fromi..toi] is special or not.
//
// Return an array of booleans answer such that answer[i] is true if nums[fromi..toi] is special.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,4,1,2,6], queries = [[0,4]]
//
// Output: [false]
//
// Explanation:
//
// The subarray is [3,4,1,2,6]. 2 and 6 are both even.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	queries[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] <= nums.length - 1

// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, sparse-table, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When you need O(1) query time for any associative operation (like sum, min, max, GCD) on a static array, after an O(N log N) preprocessing step.
//   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that supports O(1) range queries for any associative operation on a static array. It achieves this by precomputing results for specific disjoint and overlapping ranges, with an O(N log N) construction time and space complexity.
//   • Invariants: table[k][i] stores the result of the operation for a range of length 2^k starting at index i.; For any query [L, R], the result is obtained by combining two precomputed values from blocks that cover [L, mid] and [mid+1, R].
//   • Tips: Understand the block decomposition based on powers of two for construction.; Queries combine results from two precomputed blocks that cover the query range.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support point updates efficiently; any modification requires a full rebuild.; Higher space complexity of O(N log N) compared to some other range query structures.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
