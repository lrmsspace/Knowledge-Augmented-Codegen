//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer num, find the closest two integers in absolute difference whose product equals num + 1 or num + 2.
//
// Return the two integers in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: num = 8
// Output: [3,3]
// Explanation: For num + 1 = 9, the closest divisors are 3 & 3, for num + 2 = 10, the closest divisors are 2 & 5, hence 3 & 3 is chosen.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= num <= 10^9
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Primality tests (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to determine if a single number is prime, especially for numbers where trial division up to its square root is computationally feasible.
//   • Idea: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This method checks for primality by attempting to find a non-trivial divisor up to the square root of the given number, running in O(sqrt(N)) time.
//   • Invariants: No integer k in the range [2, current_divisor - 1] has been found to divide n.; The current value current_divisor is a candidate divisor being tested against n.
//   • Tips: Only check numbers between 2 and sqrt(n).; Handle 2 as a special case before iterating.
//   • Pitfalls: O(sqrt(N)) complexity can be too slow for very large numbers.; Incorrectly handling edge cases like 0, 1, or 2.
// - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance among a given set of N points in a 2D plane. It is particularly effective for large datasets where an O(N^2) approach is too slow.
//   • Idea: This divide-and-conquer algorithm finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively splitting the set of points and merging results. It achieves an optimal time complexity of O(N log N).
//   • Invariants: At the start of any recursive call, the input point set is sorted by X-coordinate.; The returned minimum distance 'd' for a subproblem is the true minimum distance among its points.
//   • Tips: Initial sorting by X-coordinate is crucial for efficient division of the point set.; Handle base cases (e.g., 2 or 3 points) with a simple brute-force distance calculation.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to sort points by Y-coordinate within the central strip can degrade performance to O(N^2).; Incorrectly defining the strip width or comparison range in the merge step can lead to incorrect results.
// - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem can be solved by making the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping this leads to a globally optimal solution. This strategy is often simpler and faster than dynamic programming.
//   • Idea: The greedy algorithm makes the best choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum, without reconsidering previous choices. Its time complexity is typically O(N log N) or O(N).
//   • Invariants: At each step, the chosen element is the best available according to the greedy criterion.; The partial solution constructed so far remains optimal for the subproblem considered.
//   • Tips: Prove correctness by exchange argument or induction.; Sort input data if it helps identify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to prove the greedy choice property.; Making a locally optimal choice that prevents a global optimum.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
