// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-fair-pairs/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n and two integers lower and upper, return the number of fair pairs.
//
// A pair (i, j) is fair if:
//
//
// 	0 <= i < j < n, and
// 	lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [0,1,7,4,4,5], lower = 3, upper = 6
// Output: 6
// Explanation: There are 6 fair pairs: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	nums.length == n
// 	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
// 	-109 <= lower <= upper <= 109

// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
// - Minkowski sum of convex polygons (geometry, array, two-pointers, sweep-line)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to compute the Minkowski sum of two convex polygons efficiently. It is ideal for applications requiring the union of shapes or collision detection between convex objects.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes the Minkowski sum of two convex polygons by merging their edge vectors, sorted by polar angle, into a new sequence of edges. The resulting sum polygon is also convex and can be constructed in O(|P| + |Q|) time.
//   • Invariants: The current vertex of the resulting sum polygon is the sum of the current vertices from P and Q.; All edges processed so far from both input polygons have been added to the output in polar angle order.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort polygon vertices to start from the lowest Y-coordinate to ensure consistent orientation.; Orient both input polygons counter-clockwise for correct edge vector generation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling polygon orientation (e.g., mixing clockwise and counter-clockwise).; Precision issues when using floating-point numbers for angle comparisons or vector additions.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
