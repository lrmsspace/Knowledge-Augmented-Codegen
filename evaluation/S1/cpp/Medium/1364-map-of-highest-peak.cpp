//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer matrix isWater of size m x n that represents a map of land and water cells.
//
//
// 	If isWater[i][j] == 0, cell (i, j) is a land cell.
// 	If isWater[i][j] == 1, cell (i, j) is a water cell.
//
//
// You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:
//
//
// 	The height of each cell must be non-negative.
// 	If the cell is a water cell, its height must be 0.
// 	Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of at most 1. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).
//
//
// Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is maximized.
//
// Return an integer matrix height of size m x n where height[i][j] is cell (i, j)'s height. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
//
// Example:
// Input: isWater = [[0,1],[0,0]]
// Output: [[1,0],[2,1]]
// Explanation: The image shows the assigned heights of each cell.
// The blue cell is the water cell, and the green cells are the land cells.
//
// Constraints:
// m == isWater.length
// 	n == isWater[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 1000
// 	isWater[i][j] is 0 or 1.
// 	There is at least one water cell.
//

// - Multi source BFS (queue, graph, multi-source-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest distance from any of a given set of source nodes to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph or grid.
//   • Idea: Multi-source BFS explores a graph or grid by starting from multiple initial nodes simultaneously, finding the shortest path from any of these sources to all other reachable nodes. It operates in O(V + E) time for graphs or O(rows * cols) for grids.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same shortest distance level from any source.; When a node `u` is dequeued, `dist[u]` represents the finalized shortest distance from any source to `u`.
//   • Tips: Initialize distances for all sources to 0 and add them to the queue.; Use a `visited` array or set to prevent redundant processing of nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark initial sources as visited before adding to the queue.; Incorrectly initializing distances for non-source nodes (should be infinity or a large value).
// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Maximum flow - Push-relabel method improved (graph, array, greedy, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this for maximum flow problems on graphs where an optimized push-relabel approach is required. It improves performance by prioritizing vertices with the greatest height for push and relabel operations.
//   • Idea: This algorithm is an optimized variant of the push-relabel maximum flow method, which improves efficiency by always selecting the vertex with the greatest height that has excess flow. This specific vertex selection strategy leads to a better theoretical time complexity, typically O(V^2 * sqrt(E)) or O(V^3) depending on implementation details.
//   • Invariants: For any edge (u, v) in the residual graph, h(u) <= h(v) + 1.; The total excess flow in the network is always non-negative.
//   • Tips: Always select the active vertex with the highest current height.; Maintain a data structure (e.g., buckets or lists) to quickly find highest-height vertices.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly managing the list of highest-height vertices.; Failing to update residual capacities after a push operation.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
