// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers nums and an integer k. A continuous subarray is called nice if there are k odd numbers on it.
//
// Return the number of nice sub-arrays.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 3
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The only sub-arrays with 3 odd numbers are [1,1,2,1] and [1,2,1,1].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 50000
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
// 	1 <= k <= nums.length
//

// - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in order. It is efficient for both convex and non-convex polygons.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing signed trapezoidal areas formed by each edge and the x-axis, or equivalently, using the shoelace formula. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of vertices.
//   • Invariants: Vertices are processed sequentially in their given order, forming edges.; The running sum `current_sum` accumulates the signed contribution from each edge processed so far.
//   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in a consistent order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; Use a data type with sufficient range (e.g., long long or double) for intermediate sums to prevent overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect vertex order will result in an incorrect signed area or even zero.; Integer overflow can occur if coordinates are large and sums exceed standard integer limits.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Sqrt Tree (array, tree, divide-and-conquer, recursion, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When performing associative range queries on an array, especially when O(1) query time is critical and O(N log log N) preprocessing is acceptable.
//   • Idea: The Sqrt Tree is a data structure that answers associative range queries on an array in O(1) time after O(N log log N) preprocessing. It achieves this by recursively applying sqrt decomposition, precomputing block-wise prefix/suffix operations and inter-block results.
//   • Invariants: The `prefixOp` array for any block `k` stores the associative sum from the block's start to each element within it.; The `suffixOp` array for any block `k` stores the associative sum from each element within it to the block's end.
//   • Tips: Ensure the operation is strictly associative for correctness.; Carefully handle block boundaries and partial blocks during query processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Using non-associative operations will yield incorrect results.; High memory usage for the 'between' array if not optimized or if N is very large.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
