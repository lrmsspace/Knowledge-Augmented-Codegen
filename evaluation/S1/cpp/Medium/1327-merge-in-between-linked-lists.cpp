// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-in-between-linked-lists/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.
//
// Remove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.
//
// The blue edges and nodes in the following figure indicate the result:
//
// Build the result list and return its head.
//
// Example:
// Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
// Output: [10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
// Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= list1.length <= 104
// 	1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1
// 	1 <= list2.length <= 104

// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
//   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
//   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, deque, 01-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently computes single-source shortest paths, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
//   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds the single-source shortest paths in a graph where all edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1. It uses a deque to process nodes, achieving an optimal time complexity of O(V + E).
//   • Invariants: When a node 'u' is extracted from the front of the deque, 'dist[u]' is its shortest path from the source.; The deque always contains nodes whose distances are either 'D' or 'D+1', where 'D' is the distance of the last node extracted.
//   • Tips: Always push 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Push 1-weight edges to the back of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Pushing 0-weight edges to the back or 1-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Not correctly initializing distances or the source node.
// - Circle-Circle Intersection (geometry, number, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the common points where two circles intersect on a 2D plane, handling cases from no intersection to infinite points.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection points of two circles by algebraically transforming their equations into a system involving one circle and one line. It typically achieves O(1) time complexity for finding the intersection points.
//   • Invariants: The relative positions and radii of the circles remain unchanged after coordinate translation.; The derived linear equation represents the radical axis of the two circles.
//   • Tips: Translate one circle to the origin to simplify the equations.; Subtract the two circle equations to derive a linear equation (the radical axis).
//   • Pitfalls: Numerical instability due to floating-point arithmetic, especially for tangent cases.; Forgetting to translate the resulting intersection points back to the original coordinate system.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
