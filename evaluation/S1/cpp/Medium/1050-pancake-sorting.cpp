// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips.
//
// In one pancake flip we do the following steps:
//
//
// 	Choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length.
// 	Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).
//
//
// For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.
//
// Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * arr.length flips will be judged as correct.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
// Output: [4,2,4,3]
// Explanation: 
// We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
// Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
// After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
// After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
// After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
// After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= arr.length <= 100
// 	1 <= arr[i] <= arr.length
// 	All integers in arr are unique (i.e. arr is a permutation of the integers from 1 to arr.length).

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, quickselect, randomized)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently find the k-th smallest or largest element in an unsorted array without fully sorting it, especially when average-case linear time complexity is acceptable and in-place modification is desired.
//   • Idea: QuickSelect is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot and recursively searches for the k-th element in the relevant partition. It offers an average-case O(N) time complexity and O(1) space.
//   • Invariants: The pivot element is always placed at its correct sorted position within the current sub-array.; All elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to it, and all elements to its right are greater than or equal to it.
//   • Tips: Randomly select pivots to ensure average-case O(N) performance and avoid worst-case scenarios.; Adjust the target index k based on whether you're seeking the k-th smallest or k-th largest element.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case O(N^2) time complexity, though rare with randomization.; Off-by-one errors are common when mapping k-th largest/smallest to 0-indexed array positions.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
//   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
//   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
