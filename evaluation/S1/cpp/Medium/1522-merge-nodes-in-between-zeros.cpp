//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 0.
//
// For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.
//
// Return the head of the modified linked list.
//
// Example:
// Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
// Output: [4,11]
// Explanation: 
// The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
// - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
// - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the list is in the range [3, 2 * 105].
// 	0 <= Node.val <= 1000
// 	There are no two consecutive nodes with Node.val == 0.
// 	The beginning and end of the linked list have Node.val == 0.

// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
//   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
//   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
