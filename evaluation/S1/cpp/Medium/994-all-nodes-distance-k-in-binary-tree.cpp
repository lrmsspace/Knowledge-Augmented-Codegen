// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node target, and an integer k, return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node.
//
// You can return the answer in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2
// Output: [7,4,1]
// Explanation: The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) have values 7, 4, and 1.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 500].
// 	0 <= Node.val <= 500
// 	All the values Node.val are unique.
// 	target is the value of one of the nodes in the tree.
// 	0 <= k <= 1000

// - Breadth-first search (graph, array, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path or minimum number of edges between nodes in an unweighted graph, or to explore a graph layer by layer. It is also suitable for finding shortest cycles or identifying all components of shortest paths.
//   • Idea: Breadth-first search systematically explores a graph level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of edges is found from a source node to all reachable nodes. It operates in O(V + E) time complexity for adjacency list representation.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at depth `k` or `k+1` from the source.; The distance recorded for any visited node is its shortest path length from the source.
//   • Tips: Run multiple BFS from different sources to find global properties like shortest cycles.; Maintain a distance array to record the shortest path length from the source to each node.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying BFS directly to weighted graphs will not yield shortest paths.; Failing to mark visited nodes can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs or incorrect path lengths.
// - Search for connected components in a graph (graph, dfs, bfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to partition an undirected graph into maximal connected subgraphs where every node is reachable from every other node within its subgraph.
//   • Idea: This algorithm identifies all connected components in an undirected graph by iteratively performing graph traversals (DFS or BFS) from unvisited nodes. It has a time complexity of O(V + E) for adjacency list representation.
//   • Invariants: All nodes visited so far belong to an identified connected component.; Any node currently being visited is part of the current connected component being explored.
//   • Tips: Maintain a visited array or set to track processed nodes.; Iterate through all nodes, starting a new traversal if a node is unvisited.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to iterate through all nodes to find all components in a disconnected graph.; Not correctly marking nodes as visited during traversal, leading to infinite loops or re-processing.
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
