//
// Problem Description:
// Given a directed acyclic graph, with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.
//
// Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.
//
// Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
// Output: [0,3]
// Explanation: It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 10^5
// 	1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= fromi, toi < n
// 	All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.

// - Counting labeled graphs (number, recursion, counting, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When the problem requires enumerating distinct labeled graphs with specific properties, such as connectivity, on a given number of vertices. It is suitable for combinatorial counting problems involving graph structures.
//   • Idea: This technique determines the number of connected labeled graphs by subtracting the count of disconnected graphs from the total. It typically employs a recursive or dynamic programming approach, often involving combinatorial terms like binomial coefficients, with a polynomial time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The total number of labeled graphs $G_n$ for $n$ vertices is always $2^{n(n-1)/2}$.; For any $n$, the sum of connected and disconnected labeled graphs equals the total number of labeled graphs.
//   • Tips: Start with the total number of labeled graphs $G_n = 2^{n(n-1)/2}$.; Use complementary counting: total graphs minus disconnected graphs.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to divide by $n$ when converting from rooted to unrooted disconnected graphs.; Incorrectly handling base cases for recursive definitions or DP states.
// - Finding articulation points in a graph in O(N+M) (graph, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when identifying critical nodes whose removal would increase the number of connected components in an undirected graph. It's essential for analyzing network robustness and vulnerability.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all articulation points (cut vertices) in an undirected graph using a single Depth First Search traversal. It operates in linear time, O(N+M), where N is vertices and M is edges.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u`, `tin[u]` is its discovery time, and `low[u]` is initialized to `tin[u]`.; After visiting all children `v` of `u` (and their subtrees), `low[u]` will hold the minimum `tin` value reachable from `u` or its descendants via tree edges and at most one back-edge.
//   • Tips: Initialize `tin` (discovery time) and `low` (lowest reachable ancestor) arrays for all vertices.; The root of the DFS tree is an articulation point if it has more than one child in the DFS tree.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize `low[u]` with `tin[u]` before processing children.; Incorrectly applying the `tin[u] <= low[v]` condition to the root node of the DFS tree.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, array, dijkstra, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum costs without a full priority queue.
//   • Idea: A specialized Breadth-First Search variant that finds shortest paths in graphs with only 0 or 1 edge weights. It uses a deque to process 0-weight edges before 1-weight edges, achieving O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the deque have a distance value of either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.; Nodes pushed to the front of the deque always have a distance equal to the current node's distance.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque to maintain the order of processing nodes.; Add nodes reached via 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a standard queue instead of a deque.; Failing to initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the source.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
