// Problem Description:
// Given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2, and maximize the product of those integers.
//
// Return the maximum product you can get.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 2
// Output: 1
// Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 58
//

// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
//   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
//   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Knuth's Optimization (array, interval, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When a range DP problem has a recurrence of the form dp(i, j) = min_k [dp(i, k) + dp(k+1, j) + C(i, j)] and the optimal splitting points satisfy opt(i, j-1) <= opt(i, j) <= opt(i+1, j).
//   • Idea: Knuth's Optimization is a technique to speed up certain dynamic programming problems on ranges from O(N^3) to O(N^2) time complexity. It applies when the optimal splitting point for a subproblem exhibits a monotonic property across adjacent subproblems.
//   • Invariants: dp[i][j] stores the minimum cost for the interval [i, j].; opt[i][j] stores the optimal split point k for interval [i, j].
//   • Tips: Verify the quadrangle inequality for the cost function C(i, j).; Ensure the optimal split points exhibit monotonicity: opt(i, j-1) <= opt(i, j) <= opt(i+1, j).
//   • Pitfalls: Applying the optimization without rigorously verifying the monotonicity condition.; Incorrectly calculating the cost function C(i, j) or its properties.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
