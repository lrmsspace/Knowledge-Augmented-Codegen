// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-postorder-traversal/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given two integer arrays, preorder and postorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree of distinct values and postorder is the postorder traversal of the same tree, reconstruct and return the binary tree.
//
// If there exist multiple answers, you can return any of them.
//
// Example:
// Input: preorder = [1,2,4,5,3,6,7], postorder = [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]
// Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= preorder.length <= 30
// 	1 <= preorder[i] <= preorder.length
// 	All the values of preorder are unique.
// 	postorder.length == preorder.length
// 	1 <= postorder[i] <= postorder.length
// 	All the values of postorder are unique.
// 	It is guaranteed that preorder and postorder are the preorder traversal and postorder traversal of the same binary tree.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
// - Sqrt Tree (array, tree, divide-and-conquer, recursion, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When performing associative range queries on an array, especially when O(1) query time is critical and O(N log log N) preprocessing is acceptable.
//   • Idea: The Sqrt Tree is a data structure that answers associative range queries on an array in O(1) time after O(N log log N) preprocessing. It achieves this by recursively applying sqrt decomposition, precomputing block-wise prefix/suffix operations and inter-block results.
//   • Invariants: The `prefixOp` array for any block `k` stores the associative sum from the block's start to each element within it.; The `suffixOp` array for any block `k` stores the associative sum from each element within it to the block's end.
//   • Tips: Ensure the operation is strictly associative for correctness.; Carefully handle block boundaries and partial blocks during query processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Using non-associative operations will yield incorrect results.; High memory usage for the 'between' array if not optimized or if N is very large.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
