// Problem Description:
// Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.
//
// Example:
// Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
// Output: 1
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 104
// 	timePoints[i] is in the format "HH:MM".

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - String Sorts (array, string, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to sort a collection of strings lexicographically, especially when string lengths vary or are large, and the character set is limited.
//   • Idea: This algorithm sorts an array of strings lexicographically by recursively applying a counting sort-like distribution based on characters from most significant to least significant digit. It typically achieves O(N*L + R*L) time complexity, where N is the number of strings, L is the average string length, and R is the radix size.
//   • Invariants: All strings in the current `a[lo...hi]` sub-array share a common prefix of length `d`.; After the distribution pass for character `d`, `aux` contains strings from `a[lo...hi]` stably sorted by their `d`-th character.
//   • Tips: Use an auxiliary array for stable distribution during each pass to maintain relative order.; Implement a cutoff to insertion sort for small sub-arrays to improve performance due to lower overhead.
//   • Pitfalls: Can have high overhead for small N or short strings compared to comparison sorts.; Potentially memory intensive due to the auxiliary array and recursion stack depth proportional to max string length.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
