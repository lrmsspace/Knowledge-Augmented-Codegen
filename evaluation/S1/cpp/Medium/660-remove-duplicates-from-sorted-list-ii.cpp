// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.
//
// Example:
// Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
// Output: [1,2,5]
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
// 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
// 	The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
//   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
//   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
// - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer, merge-sort, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this when finding the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance in a 2D plane. It efficiently handles large datasets by recursively dividing the problem and merging results.
//   • Idea: It finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively dividing the set, solving subproblems, and merging results in O(N log N) time. The merge step efficiently handles cross-boundary pairs within a narrow strip.
//   • Invariants: The minimum distance returned by a recursive call is the true minimum for its input subset.; All points in the left subproblem have x-coordinates less than or equal to the median x-coordinate.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort points by x-coordinate to enable efficient splitting.; Maintain a y-sorted list of points for efficient merging of the strip.
//   • Pitfalls: An inefficient merge step can degrade complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2).; Failing to correctly identify and process cross-boundary pairs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
