//
// Problem Description:
// You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.
//
// A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.
//
// Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
//
// Example:
// Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
// This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// rows == heights.length
// 	columns == heights[i].length
// 	1 <= rows, columns <= 100
// 	1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106
//

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - Finding the Eulerian path in O(M) (graph, enumeration, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem requires visiting every edge in a graph exactly once, either starting and ending at the same vertex (cycle) or at two different vertices (path).
//   • Idea: An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. An Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian path that starts and ends on the same vertex.
//   • Invariants: Every edge in the graph is considered exactly once for inclusion in the path.; The current path segment always forms a valid trail in the graph.
//   • Tips: Check vertex degrees to determine path/cycle existence before attempting to find it.; For an Eulerian path, start traversal from one of the two odd-degree vertices.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling multi-edges or self-loops can lead to errors in degree calculation or traversal.; Failing to check graph connectivity can result in incomplete paths or infinite loops.
// - Directed Graphs (graph, matrix, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine reachability between all pairs of vertices in a directed graph, especially for small or dense graphs where O(V*(V+E)) time is acceptable.
//   • Idea: This approach determines all-pairs reachability in a directed graph by performing a Depth-First Search starting from each vertex. It has a time complexity of O(V*(V+E)) and a space complexity of O(V^2).
//   • Invariants: For any vertex u, after its dedicated DFS completes, TC[u][v] is true for all v reachable from u.; The transitive closure matrix TC accurately reflects all-pairs reachability in the original graph.
//   • Tips: Initialize a boolean matrix to store reachability results.; For each vertex, perform a full DFS to mark all nodes reachable from it.
//   • Pitfalls: High time complexity O(V*(V+E)) makes it unsuitable for large sparse graphs.; High space complexity O(V^2) can be prohibitive for graphs with many vertices.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
