// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the root of a binary tree.
//
// A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:
//
//
// 	Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
// 	If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move to the left child.
// 	Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.
// 	Repeat the second and third steps until you can't move in the tree.
//
//
// Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).
//
// Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
// 	1 <= Node.val <= 100
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is particularly efficient when optimizing the O(N^2) dynamic programming solution to O(N log N) using binary search.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the longest subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array always stores the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The 'tails' array is always sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array 'tails' where 'tails[i]' is the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.; Utilize binary search (e.g., `std::lower_bound`) to find the correct position for the current element in the 'tails' array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing a subsequence with a contiguous subarray, which is a common mistake.; Incorrectly updating the 'tails' array, leading to non-increasing subsequences or incorrect lengths.
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
