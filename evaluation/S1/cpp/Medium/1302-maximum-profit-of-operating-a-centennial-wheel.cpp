// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-of-operating-a-centennial-wheel/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola has room for up to four people. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you runningCost dollars.
//
// You are given an array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of new customers arriving just before the ith rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel i times before the customers[i] customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays boardingCost dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.
//
// You can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.
//
// Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.
// 1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.
// 2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.
// 3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $5 - 3 * $6 = $37.
// The highest profit was $37 after rotating the wheel 3 times.
//
// Constraints:
// n == customers.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= customers[i] <= 50
// 	1 <= boardingCost, runningCost <= 100

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, number, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the optimal sequence of jobs to minimize the total completion time (makespan) on two machines, with a fixed processing order (machine 1 then machine 2) for all jobs.
//   • Idea: This problem involves ordering N jobs, each with two processing times (one for each machine), to minimize the overall makespan. Johnson's rule provides an optimal greedy solution for this specific two-machine flow shop problem in O(N log N) or O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed so far maintain the optimal relative order determined by Johnson's rule.; The current makespan is the minimum possible for the jobs already scheduled.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs based on Johnson's rule criteria: jobs with min(a_i, b_i).; Prioritize jobs with shorter machine 1 times or longer machine 2 times for early scheduling.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying Johnson's rule to problems with more than two machines, where it is not optimal.; Incorrectly sorting jobs within the two partitioned sets.
// - Convex Hull construction (geometry, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a plane. It is fundamental for various geometric algorithms and optimization problems.
//   • Idea: Convex hull construction identifies the subset of points that form the vertices of the smallest convex polygon containing all given points. Common algorithms achieve this in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sequence of points currently forming the hull maintains a convex property.; All points considered up to the current iteration are either part of the hull or lie within the polygon defined by the hull.
//   • Tips: Sort points by X-coordinate (and Y for ties) as a common preprocessing step.; Consider algorithms like Graham Scan or Monotone Chain for efficiency.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect orientation calculations.; Incorrectly handling collinear points can result in non-minimal hulls or errors.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
