//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer pivot. Rearrange nums such that the following conditions are satisfied:
//
//
// 	Every element less than pivot appears before every element greater than pivot.
// 	Every element equal to pivot appears in between the elements less than and greater than pivot.
// 	The relative order of the elements less than pivot and the elements greater than pivot is maintained.
// 	
// 		More formally, consider every pi, pj where pi is the new position of the ith element and pj is the new position of the jth element. If i < j and both elements are smaller (or larger) than pivot, then pi < pj.
// 	
// 	
//
//
// Return nums after the rearrangement.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [9,12,5,10,14,3,10], pivot = 10
// Output: [9,5,3,10,10,12,14]
// Explanation: 
// The elements 9, 5, and 3 are less than the pivot so they are on the left side of the array.
// The elements 12 and 14 are greater than the pivot so they are on the right side of the array.
// The relative ordering of the elements less than and greater than pivot is also maintained. [9, 5, 3] and [12, 14] are the respective orderings.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	-106 <= nums[i] <= 106
// 	pivot equals to an element of nums.

// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, quickselect, randomized)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently find the k-th smallest or largest element in an unsorted array without fully sorting it, especially when average-case linear time complexity is acceptable and in-place modification is desired.
//   • Idea: QuickSelect is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot and recursively searches for the k-th element in the relevant partition. It offers an average-case O(N) time complexity and O(1) space.
//   • Invariants: The pivot element is always placed at its correct sorted position within the current sub-array.; All elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to it, and all elements to its right are greater than or equal to it.
//   • Tips: Randomly select pivots to ensure average-case O(N) performance and avoid worst-case scenarios.; Adjust the target index k based on whether you're seeking the k-th smallest or k-th largest element.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case O(N^2) time complexity, though rare with randomization.; Off-by-one errors are common when mapping k-th largest/smallest to 0-indexed array positions.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, segment-tree, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence such that elements in the subsequence are in strictly increasing order, preserving their original relative order.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search or a segment tree.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or DP array) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index 'i', 'tails[i]' stores the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array where dp[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Binary search is used to find the correct position for the current element in the dp array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates for strictly increasing versus non-decreasing requirements.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
