// Problem Description:
// Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.
//
// Example:
// Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
// Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
// 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
// 	0 <= k <= 2 * 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Floyd's Linked List Cycle Finding Algorithm (linked-list, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently detect if a linked list contains a cycle and, optionally, find the entry point of that cycle, using only constant extra space.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses two pointers, one moving faster than the other, to detect if a cycle exists in a linked list. If a cycle is found, it can then determine the cycle's starting node in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The slow and fast pointers are always valid nodes or null.; In the detection phase, the fast pointer always covers twice the distance of the slow pointer.
//   • Tips: Initialize both slow and fast pointers at the head of the list.; Move the slow pointer by one step and the fast pointer by two steps in each iteration.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check for null on 'fast' and 'fast.next' before dereferencing them.; Incorrectly assuming the list is non-empty or has at least two nodes.
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
//   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
//   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
