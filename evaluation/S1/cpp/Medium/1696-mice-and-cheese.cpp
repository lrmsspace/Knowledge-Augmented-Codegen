// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/mice-and-cheese/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There are two mice and n different types of cheese, each type of cheese should be eaten by exactly one mouse.
//
// A point of the cheese with index i (0-indexed) is:
//
//
// 	reward1[i] if the first mouse eats it.
// 	reward2[i] if the second mouse eats it.
//
//
// You are given a positive integer array reward1, a positive integer array reward2, and a non-negative integer k.
//
// Return the maximum points the mice can achieve if the first mouse eats exactly k types of cheese.
//
// Example:
// Input: reward1 = [1,1,3,4], reward2 = [4,4,1,1], k = 2
// Output: 15
// Explanation: In this example, the first mouse eats the 2nd (0-indexed) and the 3rd types of cheese, and the second mouse eats the 0th and the 1st types of cheese.
// The total points are 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 15.
// It can be proven that 15 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == reward1.length == reward2.length <= 105
// 	1 <= reward1[i], reward2[i] <= 1000
// 	0 <= k <= n

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
// - Fibonacci Numbers (number, greedy, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need a unique, non-ambiguous binary representation of positive integers based on Fibonacci numbers, ensuring no two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are used in the sum.
//   • Idea: This algorithm encodes a positive integer into a unique binary string by greedily finding its Zeckendorf representation (sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers). The encoding process typically involves iterating through Fibonacci numbers, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity relative to the input number's magnitude.
//   • Invariants: The remaining value 'n' to be encoded is always non-negative.; The partial binary code constructed so far represents a valid Zeckendorf sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
//   • Tips: Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a certain limit to optimize lookups.; Always start with the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the target value.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the base cases for small numbers like 1 or 2.; Forgetting to append the mandatory final '1' bit to the codeword.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
