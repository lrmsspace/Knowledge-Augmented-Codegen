//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums and an array queries where queries[i] = [vali, indexi].
//
// For each query i, first, apply nums[indexi] = nums[indexi] + vali, then print the sum of the even values of nums.
//
// Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
// Output: [8,6,2,4]
// Explanation: At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
// After adding 1 to nums[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
// After adding -3 to nums[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
// After adding -4 to nums[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
// After adding 2 to nums[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 104
// 	-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 104
// 	-104 <= vali <= 104
// 	0 <= indexi < nums.length
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Range Minimum Query (array, tree, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the minimum (or maximum) value within various specified ranges of an array efficiently. Suitable for scenarios with many queries on a fixed or frequently updated dataset.
//   • Idea: This technique precomputes answers for subproblems, typically by building a tree-like structure or a table, to efficiently answer queries for the minimum (or maximum) value within a given range. It achieves O(log N) or O(1) query time after O(N log N) or O(N) preprocessing, depending on the specific data structure used.
//   • Invariants: For a Segment Tree node covering range [L, R], its value stores the minimum of all elements in the original array from index L to R.; For any query range [Q_L, Q_R], the combined result from relevant tree nodes correctly represents the minimum in [Q_L, Q_R].
//   • Tips: For static arrays, Sparse Table offers O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.; For dynamic arrays with updates, Segment Tree offers O(log N) query and update time after O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when defining range boundaries or calculating indices.; Incorrect merge logic for segment tree nodes (e.g., using sum instead of min).
// - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When you need to calculate the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in sequential order. It efficiently handles both convex and non-convex polygons.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing the signed areas of trapezoids or triangles formed by its edges and a reference point/axis. It achieves O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sum accumulates the signed area contribution of processed edges.; The current vertex and the next vertex define an edge of the polygon.
//   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in sequential order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; The absolute value of the final result is the polygon's area.
//   • Pitfalls: Supplying vertices in a non-sequential or arbitrary order will yield an incorrect area.; Applying the formula to self-intersecting polygons will not give the true geometric area.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
