//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s containing an out-of-order English representation of digits 0-9, return the digits in ascending order.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "owoztneoer"
// Output: "012"
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s[i] is one of the characters ["e","g","f","i","h","o","n","s","r","u","t","w","v","x","z"].
// 	s is guaranteed to be valid.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Fibonacci Numbers (number, greedy, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need a unique, non-ambiguous binary representation of positive integers based on Fibonacci numbers, ensuring no two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are used in the sum.
//   • Idea: This algorithm encodes a positive integer into a unique binary string by greedily finding its Zeckendorf representation (sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers). The encoding process typically involves iterating through Fibonacci numbers, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity relative to the input number's magnitude.
//   • Invariants: The remaining value 'n' to be encoded is always non-negative.; The partial binary code constructed so far represents a valid Zeckendorf sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
//   • Tips: Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a certain limit to optimize lookups.; Always start with the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the target value.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the base cases for small numbers like 1 or 2.; Forgetting to append the mandatory final '1' bit to the codeword.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
