// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-balanced/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.
//
// You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.
//
// Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "aababbab"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: You can either:
// Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
// Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s[i] is 'a' or 'b'​​.

// - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences of a pattern in a text, analyzing string periodicity, or counting distinct substrings. It is especially useful for processing extremely long or recursively defined strings where explicit construction is impossible.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm leverages a precomputed prefix function (LPS array) to avoid redundant comparisons during string searching, achieving linear time complexity. The prefix function itself determines the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix, enabling various string property analyses in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: For any index `i`, `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i]`.; During prefix function computation, `j` always represents the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i-1]` that is also a suffix.
//   • Tips: The prefix function `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix.; Concatenate pattern, a unique separator, and text (`P + # + T`) to find all pattern occurrences.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors with array indexing or the precise definition of the prefix function.; Incorrectly handling the unique separator character in concatenated strings, leading to false matches.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
// - Suffix Automaton (string, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently represent all substrings of a given string and perform various string operations like counting distinct substrings or pattern matching in linear time.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal finite automaton that accepts all suffixes of a given string. It implicitly represents all substrings and can be constructed in linear time, O(N) where N is the string length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the initial state spells a substring of the original string.; Each state represents a set of substrings that share the same end positions in the original string.
//   • Tips: Understand the concept of `endpos` sets and how they define states.; The number of states and transitions in a suffix automaton is linear with respect to string length.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm can be complex and prone to off-by-one errors or incorrect link updates.; Debugging state transitions and suffix links requires careful attention.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
