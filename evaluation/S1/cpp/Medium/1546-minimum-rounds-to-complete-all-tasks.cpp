// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-rounds-to-complete-all-tasks/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array tasks, where tasks[i] represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level.
//
// Return the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.
//
// Example:
// Input: tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
// - In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
// - In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
// - In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
// - In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
// It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= tasks.length <= 105
// 	1 <= tasks[i] <= 109
//

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, number, sparse-table, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries on a static array in O(1) time, after an initial O(N log N) preprocessing phase. It is particularly efficient for associative operations like sum, min, or max.
//   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes results for all possible range queries on a static array using a hierarchical block decomposition. It achieves O(N log N) construction time and space complexity, enabling O(1) query time for associative operations.
//   • Invariants: ST[k][i] stores the result for a range of length 2^k starting at i within its block.; For any level k, blocks are disjoint, but ranges within ST[k] can overlap with ranges in ST[k-1].
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values or highest set bit for efficient level determination.; Ensure the operation (e.g., sum, min, max) is associative for correct combination.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for arrays that require updates, as it's a static data structure.; Only works for associative operations; non-associative operations cannot be combined this way.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: When tasks need to be processed sequentially on a single resource to optimize a cumulative metric like total completion time or weighted sum of completion times.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal sequence for processing jobs on a single machine by applying a greedy strategy, often involving sorting based on specific criteria. It typically achieves an optimal schedule in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The list of jobs is sorted according to the chosen greedy criterion.; For any prefix of the sorted jobs, the current schedule minimizes the objective function for those jobs.
//   • Tips: Identify the correct sorting key (e.g., processing time, weight/time ratio) for the objective function.; Prove optimality using an exchange argument to justify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying an incorrect sorting criterion for the specific optimization objective.; Assuming a greedy approach is always optimal without a formal proof.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
