//
// Problem Description:
// There is a class with m students and n exams. You are given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix score, where each row represents one student and score[i][j] denotes the score the ith student got in the jth exam. The matrix score contains distinct integers only.
//
// You are also given an integer k. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the kth (0-indexed) exam from the highest to the lowest.
//
// Return the matrix after sorting it.
//
// Example:
// Input: score = [[10,6,9,1],[7,5,11,2],[4,8,3,15]], k = 2
// Output: [[7,5,11,2],[10,6,9,1],[4,8,3,15]]
// Explanation: In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.
// - The student with index 1 scored 11 in exam 2, which is the highest score, so they got first place.
// - The student with index 0 scored 9 in exam 2, which is the second highest score, so they got second place.
// - The student with index 2 scored 3 in exam 2, which is the lowest score, so they got third place.
//
// Constraints:
// m == score.length
// 	n == score[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 250
// 	1 <= score[i][j] <= 105
// 	score consists of distinct integers.
// 	0 <= k < n

// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use Merge Sort when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or linked lists where random access is costly.
//   • Idea: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: Each sub-array passed to merge is sorted.; The merge operation combines two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array.
//   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to maintain stability.; Consider iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: High space complexity due to auxiliary arrays.; Overhead of recursion can be significant for small inputs.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine to minimize the total weighted completion time, where each job has a processing time and a linear penalty coefficient.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine with linear penalty functions by sorting jobs based on a specific ratio. It achieves an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The partial schedule constructed so far is optimal for the jobs included.; For any two adjacent jobs 'j' and 'k' in the final schedule, if 'j' precedes 'k', then 'c_j/t_j >= c_k/t_k'.
//   • Tips: Derive the sorting criterion using an exchange argument for adjacent jobs.; The optimal order is determined by the ratio of cost coefficient to processing time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the sorting criterion, especially the ratio order.; Overlooking edge cases like zero processing times or zero penalty coefficients.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
