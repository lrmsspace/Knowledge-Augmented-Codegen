// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-collisions-of-monkeys-on-a-polygon/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a regular convex polygon with n vertices. The vertices are labeled from 0 to n - 1 in a clockwise direction, and each vertex has exactly one monkey. The following figure shows a convex polygon of 6 vertices.
//
// Simultaneously, each monkey moves to a neighboring vertex. A collision happens if at least two monkeys reside on the same vertex after the movement or intersect on an edge.
//
// Return the number of ways the monkeys can move so that at least one collision happens. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3
//
// Output: 6
//
// Explanation:
//
// There are 8 total possible movements.
// Two ways such that they collide at some point are:
//
//
// 	Monkey 1 moves in a clockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 2 collide.
// 	Monkey 1 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 3 collide.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= n <= 109

// - Binomial Coefficients (array, number, mod-exp, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating combinations (n choose k) efficiently, especially for large n, and when results are required modulo a prime or prime power.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes binomial coefficients C(n, k) modulo a given prime m or prime power p^b. It leverages precomputed factorials and their modular inverses to achieve O(1) query time after O(MAXN) or O(MAXN log m) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: Factorials `fact[i]` are correctly computed as `i! % m`.; Modular inverse factorials `invFact[i]` satisfy `(fact[i] * invFact[i]) % m == 1`.
//   • Tips: Precompute factorials modulo m up to MAXN.; Precompute modular inverses of factorials for O(1) query time.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to take modulo at each multiplication step during factorial precomputation.; Using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverse when the modulus is not prime.
// - Lattice points inside non-lattice polygon (number, recursion, counting, gcd)
//   • When to use: Use when counting pairs or elements satisfying divisibility or GCD conditions. Also applicable for summing functions over pairs using number theory properties.
//   • Idea: This approach leverages number theoretic properties like GCD, LCM, and prime factorization to efficiently count elements or pairs satisfying specific criteria. It often involves iterating through divisors or multiples, achieving complexities like O(N log N) or O(sqrt N) per query.
//   • Invariants: All numbers processed so far have their relevant number-theoretic properties (e.g., prime factors, divisors) correctly determined.; The current count or sum accurately reflects all valid combinations found up to the current iteration.
//   • Tips: Precompute primes or divisors using a sieve for efficiency.; Utilize properties of GCD and LCM, such as gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b.
//   • Pitfalls: Overcounting or undercounting when using inclusion-exclusion.; Integer overflow with large products or sums.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
