// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-convert-all-elements-to-zero/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array nums of size n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to apply some (possibly zero) operations on the array so that all elements become 0.
//
// In one operation, you can select a subarray [i, j] (where 0 <= i <= j < n) and set all occurrences of the minimum non-negative integer in that subarray to 0.
//
// Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array 0.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [0,2]
//
// Output: 1
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	Select the subarray [1,1] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [0,0].
// 	Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == nums.length <= 105
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 105
//

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (matrix, array, dp-2d, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count elements satisfying "at least one" of several properties, especially when direct counting is complicated by overlapping sets. It's also applicable for counting elements satisfying "none" of the properties by subtracting from the total.
//   • Idea: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle is a combinatorial method to determine the size of the union of multiple finite sets. It works by summing the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all pairwise intersections, adding back the sizes of all three-way intersections, and so on, with alternating signs.
//   • Invariants: The count for any element satisfying `k` properties is adjusted to be exactly 1 in the final sum.; Each term in the sum corresponds to the size of an intersection of a distinct subset of properties.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the universe and the properties (sets) you are interested in.; Systematically list all combinations of properties for intersection terms.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying or defining the properties or sets.; Missing certain intersection terms or double-counting them.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > previous) {
                operations += 1;
                previous = num;
