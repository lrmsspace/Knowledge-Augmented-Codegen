//
// Problem Description:
// There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for n days. On the ith day, the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot after days[i] days, that is on day i + days[i] the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.
//
// You decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first n days.
//
// Given two integer arrays days and apples of length n, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.
//
// Example:
// Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: You can eat 7 apples:
// - On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
// - On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
// - On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
// - On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
//
// Constraints:
// n == apples.length == days.length
// 	1 <= n <= 2 * 104
// 	0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 104
// 	days[i] = 0 if and only if apples[i] = 0.

// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (array, heap, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when given a set of tasks with deadlines and durations, and the objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks without interruption.
//   • Idea: This greedy algorithm aims to maximize the number of jobs completed by prioritizing tasks that finish earliest. It typically involves sorting and using a min-heap, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed up to the current point have been considered for scheduling.; The set of jobs in the heap represents the jobs currently scheduled to meet their deadlines.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by their deadlines in ascending order.; Maintain a min-heap of durations for jobs currently scheduled.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing job count maximization with total duration or profit.; Failing to update the current time correctly after scheduling a job.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
// - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (queue, stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query the minimum element of a stack or queue in O(1) average time. Also applicable for finding minimums in all fixed-length subarrays using a sliding window.
//   • Idea: This technique augments a stack or queue to support O(1) average time retrieval of its minimum element, typically by storing minimums alongside data or using auxiliary structures. It achieves amortized constant time for all operations.
//   • Invariants: For a minimum stack, the auxiliary minimum stack's top element is always the minimum of all elements currently in the main stack.; For a minimum queue implemented with two stacks, the output stack is only refilled from the input stack when the output stack becomes empty.
//   • Tips: For a minimum stack, use an auxiliary stack to store minimums encountered so far.; Only push to the auxiliary minimum stack if the new element is less than or equal to its current top.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to pop from the auxiliary minimum stack when the main stack's top is removed.; Incorrectly handling the transfer logic between the two stacks for a minimum queue.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

                current[1]--; // Eat one apple
                eaten++;
                // If there are still apples left, put it back into the queue
                if (current[1] > 0) {
