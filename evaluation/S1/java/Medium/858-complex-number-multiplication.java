//
// Problem Description:
// A complex number can be represented as a string on the form "real+imaginaryi" where:
//
//
// 	real is the real part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].
// 	imaginary is the imaginary part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].
// 	i2 == -1.
//
//
// Given two complex numbers num1 and num2 as strings, return a string of the complex number that represents their multiplications.
//
// Example:
// Input: num1 = "1+1i", num2 = "1+1i"
// Output: "0+2i"
// Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.
//
// Constraints:
// num1 and num2 are valid complex numbers.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use to efficiently represent all suffixes of a string in a compressed form, ideal for various string problems like pattern matching or counting distinct substrings.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a minimal Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that accepts all suffixes of a given string, offering O(N) time construction and O(N) memory complexity.
//   • Invariants: Every state in the automaton represents a set of substrings of the original string.; Each state's longest path from the initial state corresponds to its longest string.
//   • Tips: Understand the definition of states and transitions, and their relationship to substrings.; Leverage its linear time and space complexity for efficient string processing on large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm can be complex and challenging to implement correctly.; Debugging state transitions, suffix links, and their properties requires careful attention.
// - Circle-Circle Intersection (geometry, number, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the common points where two circles intersect on a 2D plane, handling cases from no intersection to infinite points.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection points of two circles by algebraically transforming their equations into a system involving one circle and one line. It typically achieves O(1) time complexity for finding the intersection points.
//   • Invariants: The relative positions and radii of the circles remain unchanged after coordinate translation.; The derived linear equation represents the radical axis of the two circles.
//   • Tips: Translate one circle to the origin to simplify the equations.; Subtract the two circle equations to derive a linear equation (the radical axis).
//   • Pitfalls: Numerical instability due to floating-point arithmetic, especially for tangent cases.; Forgetting to translate the resulting intersection points back to the original coordinate system.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public String complexNumberMultiply(String num1, String num2) {
        String[] parts1 = num1.split("\\+");
        String[] parts2 = num2.split("\\+");

        int a = Integer.parseInt(parts1[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(parts1[1].substring(0, parts1[1].length() - 1));
        int c = Integer.parseInt(parts2[0]);
        int d = Integer.parseInt(parts2[1].substring(0, parts2[1].length() - 1));

        int realPart = a * c - b * d;
        int imaginaryPart = a * d + b * c;

        return realPart + "+" + imaginaryPart + "i";            
    }
