// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/path-existence-queries-in-a-graph-i/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
//
// You are also given an integer array nums of length n sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer maxDiff.
//
// An undirected edge exists between nodes i and j if the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most maxDiff (i.e., |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff).
//
// You are also given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[i] = [ui, vi], determine whether there exists a path between nodes ui and vi.
//
// Return a boolean array answer, where answer[i] is true if there exists a path between ui and vi in the ith query and false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 2, nums = [1,3], maxDiff = 1, queries = [[0,0],[0,1]]
//
// Output: [true,false]
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	Query [0,0]: Node 0 has a trivial path to itself.
// 	Query [0,1]: There is no edge between Node 0 and Node 1 because |nums[0] - nums[1]| = |1 - 3| = 2, which is greater than maxDiff.
// 	Thus, the final answer after processing all the queries is [true, false].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == nums.length <= 105
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
// 	0 <= maxDiff <= 105
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	queries[i] == [ui, vi]
// 	0 <= ui, vi < n

// - Finding Bridges Online (graph, tree, union-find, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to dynamically track bridges and 2-edge-connected components in a graph as edges are added. It efficiently updates the graph structure and bridge count in an online fashion.
//   • Idea: This algorithm maintains 2-edge-connected components and bridges in a graph as edges are added, using a Union-Find structure to manage components and a forest to represent the relationships between them. It typically achieves near-amortized constant time per edge addition.
//   • Invariants: Each 2-edge-connected component is represented by a single root in the Union-Find structure.; The set of bridges forms a forest where each node is a 2-edge-connected component.
//   • Tips: Represent 2-edge-connected components using Union-Find for efficient merging.; Maintain a forest where nodes are 2-edge-connected components and edges are bridges.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying when an edge forms a cycle with existing bridges.; Failing to update the bridge count accurately when bridges are removed.
// - Finding the Eulerian path in O(M) (graph, enumeration, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem requires visiting every edge in a graph exactly once, either starting and ending at the same vertex (cycle) or at two different vertices (path).
//   • Idea: An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. An Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian path that starts and ends on the same vertex.
//   • Invariants: Every edge in the graph is considered exactly once for inclusion in the path.; The current path segment always forms a valid trail in the graph.
//   • Tips: Check vertex degrees to determine path/cycle existence before attempting to find it.; For an Eulerian path, start traversal from one of the two odd-degree vertices.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling multi-edges or self-loops can lead to errors in degree calculation or traversal.; Failing to check graph connectivity can result in incomplete paths or infinite loops.
// - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer, merge-sort, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this when finding the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance in a 2D plane. It efficiently handles large datasets by recursively dividing the problem and merging results.
//   • Idea: It finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively dividing the set, solving subproblems, and merging results in O(N log N) time. The merge step efficiently handles cross-boundary pairs within a narrow strip.
//   • Invariants: The minimum distance returned by a recursive call is the true minimum for its input subset.; All points in the left subproblem have x-coordinates less than or equal to the median x-coordinate.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort points by x-coordinate to enable efficient splitting.; Maintain a y-sorted list of points for efficient merging of the strip.
//   • Pitfalls: An inefficient merge step can degrade complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2).; Failing to correctly identify and process cross-boundary pairs.
