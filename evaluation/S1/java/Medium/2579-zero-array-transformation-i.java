//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri].
//
// For each queries[i]:
//
//
// 	Select a subset of indices within the range [li, ri] in nums.
// 	Decrement the values at the selected indices by 1.
//
//
// A Zero Array is an array where all elements are equal to 0.
//
// Return true if it is possible to transform nums into a Zero Array after processing all the queries sequentially, otherwise return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,0,1], queries = [[0,2]]
//
// Output: true
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	For i = 0:
//
// 	
// 		Select the subset of indices as [0, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
// 		The array will become [0, 0, 0], which is a Zero Array.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	queries[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= li <= ri < nums.length

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Segment Tree (tree, array, segment-tree, recursion, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: Use for efficient range queries and updates on an array. It handles aggregated information over dynamic intervals.
//   • Idea: A segment tree is a tree data structure used for storing information about intervals or segments. It allows answering range queries and range updates in logarithmic time, making it efficient for dynamic array problems.
//   • Invariants: Each node represents a contiguous segment of the original array.; The value stored in a parent node is an aggregation of its children's values.
//   • Tips: Build the tree recursively, dividing the array into halves.; Each node stores an aggregate value for its corresponding segment.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling array indexing (0-based vs 1-based).; Off-by-one errors in segment boundaries during queries/updates.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (array, stack, monotonic-stack, max-window)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to find the largest rectangular submatrix composed entirely of zeros within a binary matrix. It efficiently reduces the 2D problem to a series of 1D largest rectangle in histogram problems.
//   • Idea: The algorithm transforms a 2D matrix problem into a series of 1D 'largest rectangle in histogram' problems, one for each row. It uses a monotonic stack to find the nearest smaller elements for each bar in O(N) time, leading to an overall O(N*M) complexity for the 2D problem.
//   • Invariants: The stack always stores indices of elements in strictly increasing order of their corresponding heights.; When an element is popped from the stack, the element below it is its nearest smaller element to the left.
//   • Tips: Precompute heights for each column, representing consecutive zeros upwards from the current row.; The 2D problem is effectively reduced to finding the largest rectangle in a histogram for each row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when using the stack (e.g., empty stack, end of array).; Off-by-one errors when calculating the width of the rectangle (k2 - k1 - 1).
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (tree, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently find the MEX of a sequence after multiple point updates, where the sequence elements are non-negative integers.
//   • Idea: This approach uses a segment tree or similar data structure to maintain counts of elements, allowing efficient O(log N) updates and O(log N) queries for the minimal excluded number (MEX). The core idea is to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sequence.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree correctly stores the count of distinct numbers within its represented range.; The MEX query always explores the leftmost child first if its range is not 'full' (i.e., missing elements).
//   • Tips: Build the tree over the range of possible non-negative integer values, typically up to N or a maximum constraint.; Each tree node should store the count of distinct numbers present within its represented range.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle numbers larger than the maximum range covered by the segment tree.; Incorrectly updating counts for elements, leading to stale or erroneous MEX values.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
