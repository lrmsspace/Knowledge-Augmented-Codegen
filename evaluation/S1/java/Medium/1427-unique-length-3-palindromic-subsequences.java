// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-length-3-palindromic-subsequences/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.
//
// Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.
//
// A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
//
// A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
//
//
// 	For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "aabca"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
// - "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
// - "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
// - "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s consists of only lowercase English letters.

// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When all subsets of a fixed size K need to be generated, either in lexicographical order or such that successive combinations differ by exactly one element.
//   • Idea: This algorithm enumerates all K-combinations from a set, either in lexicographical order or using a Gray code approach where adjacent combinations differ by a single element. It typically runs in O(N choose K) time, generating each combination in O(K) or O(1) amortized time.
//   • Invariants: Each generated combination contains exactly K distinct elements.; All elements within a combination are unique and from the original set.
//   • Tips: For lexicographical generation, find the rightmost element that can be incremented without exceeding its maximum possible value.; After incrementing an element, set all subsequent elements to their minimum valid values.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions for the rightmost element or its maximum value.; Off-by-one errors when assigning subsequent elements after an increment.
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring within a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity for this task.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all maximal palindromic substrings centered at each position in a string by leveraging symmetry and previously computed results. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: d_odd[i] stores the radius of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.; The (l, r) interval always defines the rightmost palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with delimiters to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Maintain the current rightmost boundary `r` of the largest palindrome found.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update the `(l, r)` boundaries after processing each center.; Incorrectly calculating mirror positions or handling boundary cases for `i > r`.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
