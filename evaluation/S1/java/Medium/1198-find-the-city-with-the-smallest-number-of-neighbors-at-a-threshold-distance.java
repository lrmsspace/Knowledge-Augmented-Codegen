//
// Problem Description:
// There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. Given the array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities fromi and toi, and given the integer distanceThreshold.
//
// Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most distanceThreshold, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.
//
// Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
// The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
// City 0 -> [City 1, City 2] 
// City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3] 
// City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3] 
// City 3 -> [City 1, City 2] 
// Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 100
// 	1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
// 	edges[i].length == 3
// 	0 <= fromi < toi < n
// 	1 <= weighti, distanceThreshold <= 10^4
// 	All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.

// - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (graph, matrix, floyd-warshall, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, especially if negative edge weights are present but no negative cycles.
//   • Idea: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming approach that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It iteratively considers all possible intermediate vertices to update path lengths, achieving an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, d[i][j] stores the shortest path from i to j using only vertices {1, ..., k} as intermediate nodes.; d[i][j] always represents a valid path length or infinity, never an invalid negative value unless a negative cycle is detected.
//   • Tips: Initialize direct edge weights and infinity for non-existent edges.; Set distance from a vertex to itself to zero initially.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect loop order (k must be outermost) will yield incorrect results.; Improper handling of 'infinity' values can lead to overflow or incorrect comparisons.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
