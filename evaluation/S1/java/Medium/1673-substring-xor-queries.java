//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a binary string s, and a 2D integer array queries where queries[i] = [firsti, secondi].
//
// For the ith query, find the shortest substring of s whose decimal value, val, yields secondi when bitwise XORed with firsti. In other words, val ^ firsti == secondi.
//
// The answer to the ith query is the endpoints (0-indexed) of the substring [lefti, righti] or [-1, -1] if no such substring exists. If there are multiple answers, choose the one with the minimum lefti.
//
// Return an array ans where ans[i] = [lefti, righti] is the answer to the ith query.
//
// A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "101101", queries = [[0,5],[1,2]]
// Output: [[0,2],[2,3]]
// Explanation: For the first query the substring in range [0,2] is "101" which has a decimal value of 5, and 5 ^ 0 = 5, hence the answer to the first query is [0,2]. In the second query, the substring in range [2,3] is "11", and has a decimal value of 3, and 3 ^ 1 = 2. So, [2,3] is returned for the second query.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 104
// 	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	0 <= firsti, secondi <= 109

// - Range Minimum Query (array, bitset, bit-fenwick)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently query the minimum value within a range and perform point updates on an array. It's suitable for scenarios requiring logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick tree (BIT) can be adapted to answer Range Minimum Queries and perform point updates in O(log N) time. It achieves this by storing prefix minimums in a tree-like structure, allowing efficient aggregation.
//   • Invariants: Each node `tree[i]` stores the minimum of a specific range `[i - (i & -i) + 1, i]`.; An update to `arr[idx]` correctly propagates the new minimum to all relevant `tree` nodes.
//   • Tips: Adapt standard BIT operations for minimums instead of sums.; Use `min(current_value, new_value)` for updates and queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Standard BIT operations are for sums; direct application for minimums is incorrect.; Querying a range `[L, R]` for minimum is not a simple `query(R) - query(L-1)`.
// - Suffix Automaton (string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently process all substrings or suffixes of a given string, especially for counting distinct substrings, finding occurrences, or other complex string pattern problems. It provides linear time solutions for many tasks.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a directed acyclic graph that compactly represents all distinct substrings of a given string. It enables solving a wide range of string-related problems in linear time, typically O(N) or O(N log A) where N is string length and A is alphabet size.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the initial state corresponds to a distinct substring of the original string.; Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end positions.
//   • Tips: Understand the two types of links: suffix links (parent) and transition links (children).; Construction is typically incremental, adding characters one by one.
//   • Pitfalls: Implementation complexity is high; careful handling of state creation and link updates is crucial.; Off-by-one errors in length calculations or suffix link assignments are common.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    public int[][] substringXorQueries(String s, int[][] queries) {
        int n = s.length();
        // Map to store the first occurrence of each value
        Map<Integer, int[]> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Precompute all possible substrings up to length 30
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '0') {
                map.putIfAbsent(0, new int[]{i, i});
                continue;

            int val = 0;

                map.putIfAbsent(val, new int[]{i, j});
            }
        }

        // Process each query
        int q = queries.length;
        int[][] result = new int[q][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
            int target = queries[i][0] ^ queries[i][1];
            result[i] = map.getOrDefault(target, new int[]{-1, -1});
