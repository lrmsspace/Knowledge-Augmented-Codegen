// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/where-will-the-ball-fall/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You have a 2-D grid of size m x n representing a box, and you have n balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.
//
// Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.
//
//
// 	A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as 1.
// 	A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as -1.
//
//
// We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.
//
// Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the ith column at the top, or -1 if the ball gets stuck in the box.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
// Output: [1,-1,-1,-1,-1]
// Explanation: This example is shown in the photo.
// Ball b0 is dropped at column 0 and falls out of the box at column 1.
// Ball b1 is dropped at column 1 and will get stuck in the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
// Ball b2 is dropped at column 2 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
// Ball b3 is dropped at column 3 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
// Ball b4 is dropped at column 4 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 100
// 	grid[i][j] is 1 or -1.

// - Minimum Enclosing Circle (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the smallest circle that contains all given points in a 2D plane, often with a requirement for expected linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: This algorithm iteratively constructs the Minimum Enclosing Circle (MEC) by considering points one by one, potentially updating the circle if a new point lies outside. It achieves an expected linear time complexity, O(N), through randomization.
//   • Invariants: The current circle C is the MEC for the subset of points processed so far.; If C is defined by 1 point p_i, it is the MEC of points processed so far that passes through p_i.
//   • Tips: Randomly shuffle input points to achieve expected linear time complexity.; The Minimum Enclosing Circle is always defined by 2 or 3 points on its boundary.
//   • Pitfalls: A naive implementation without randomization can lead to O(N^3) worst-case time complexity.; Floating-point precision issues can arise in geometric calculations, requiring careful handling.
// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Reservoir Sampling (array, randomized, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to randomly select a fixed number of items (k) from a stream or a very large dataset of unknown size, ensuring each item has an equal probability of selection in a single pass.
//   • Idea: Reservoir sampling is a randomized algorithm that selects k items from a list containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number, ensuring each item has an equal probability of being selected. It processes the input in a single pass with O(N) time complexity and O(k) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The reservoir always contains exactly k elements.; Any element processed up to the current index `i` has a k/(i+1) probability of being in the reservoir.
//   • Tips: Initialize the reservoir with the first k elements from the stream.; For each subsequent element, generate a random index from 0 to current_stream_index.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize the reservoir with the first k elements.; Generating random indices outside the valid range [0, current_stream_index] or [0, k-1].

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
