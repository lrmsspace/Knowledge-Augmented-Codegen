// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
//
//
// 	For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
//
//
// When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
//
// Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
// Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

// - Substring Search (string, number, hashing, randomized, rolling-hash)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text string, especially for average-case fast string matching. It is suitable for scenarios involving large texts or multiple patterns.
//   • Idea: The Rabin-Karp algorithm finds pattern occurrences in a text by comparing hash values of the pattern and text substrings. It uses a rolling hash function for O(1) substring hash updates, achieving O(N+M) average time complexity and O(NM) worst-case.
//   • Invariants: The pattern's hash value patHash remains constant throughout the search.; At each step i, txtHash accurately represents the hash of txt[i...i+m-1].
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime modulus to minimize hash collisions.; Use a random base for polynomial hashing to enhance collision resistance.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions can lead to false positives, increasing worst-case time.; Improper choice of prime modulus or base can degrade performance.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is particularly efficient when optimizing the O(N^2) dynamic programming solution to O(N log N) using binary search.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the longest subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array always stores the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The 'tails' array is always sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array 'tails' where 'tails[i]' is the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.; Utilize binary search (e.g., `std::lower_bound`) to find the correct position for the current element in the 'tails' array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing a subsequence with a contiguous subarray, which is a common mistake.; Incorrectly updating the 'tails' array, leading to non-increasing subsequences or incorrect lengths.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
