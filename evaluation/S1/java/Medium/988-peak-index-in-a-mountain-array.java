// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.
//
// Return the index of the peak element.
//
// Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [0,1,0]
//
// Output: 1
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= arr.length <= 105
// 	0 <= arr[i] <= 106
// 	arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
// - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, lca)
//   • When to use: Use this technique for efficiently answering multiple Range Minimum Queries on a static array, especially when an asymptotically optimal O(1) query time solution is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm solves the static Range Minimum Query problem by first constructing a Cartesian tree from the input array, then reducing RMQ queries to Lowest Common Ancestor queries on this tree. It achieves an optimal O(N) preprocessing time and O(1) query time.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the original array segment represented by `u`'s subtree.; The in-order traversal of the Cartesian tree nodes' original array indices yields the original array `A`'s indices in increasing order.
//   • Tips: Construct the Cartesian tree efficiently in O(N) time, typically using a stack-based approach.; The value of the LCA of two nodes in the Cartesian tree corresponds to the minimum in the original array range between their indices.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Cartesian tree, especially when handling duplicate values or edge cases like empty arrays.; The Farach-Colton and Bender LCA algorithm is complex to implement and often requires significant effort.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
