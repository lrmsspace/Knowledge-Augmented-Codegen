// Problem Description:
// You are given two string arrays positive_feedback and negative_feedback, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that no word is both positive and negative.
//
// Initially every student has 0 points. Each positive word in a feedback report increases the points of a student by 3, whereas each negative word decreases the points by 1.
//
// You are given n feedback reports, represented by a 0-indexed string array report and a 0-indexed integer array student_id, where student_id[i] represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report report[i]. The ID of each student is unique.
//
// Given an integer k, return the top k students after ranking them in non-increasing order by their points. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.
//
// Example:
// Input: positive_feedback = ["smart","brilliant","studious"], negative_feedback = ["not"], report = ["this student is studious","the student is smart"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2
// Output: [1,2]
// Explanation: 
// Both the students have 1 positive feedback and 3 points but since student 1 has a lower ID he ranks higher.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= positive_feedback.length, negative_feedback.length <= 104
// 	1 <= positive_feedback[i].length, negative_feedback[j].length <= 100
// 	Both positive_feedback[i] and negative_feedback[j] consists of lowercase English letters.
// 	No word is present in both positive_feedback and negative_feedback.
// 	n == report.length == student_id.length
// 	1 <= n <= 104
// 	report[i] consists of lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
// 	There is a single space between consecutive words of report[i].
// 	1 <= report[i].length <= 100
// 	1 <= student_id[i] <= 109
// 	All the values of student_id[i] are unique.
// 	1 <= k <= n

// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare strings or substrings, especially in scenarios involving large texts or numerous comparisons. It's also useful for pattern matching and detecting duplicates in collections of strings.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string into a numerical value (hash) to enable fast comparisons and lookups. This technique typically uses polynomial hashing with a base and a modulus, offering O(L) for initial hash computation and O(1) for substring hashes after O(N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: The hash of a string S of length L is (S[0]*P^(L-1) + S[1]*P^(L-2) + ... + S[L-1]*P^0) % M.; For any substring S[i...j], its hash can be derived from precomputed prefix hashes in O(1) time.
//   • Tips: Use multiple hash functions with different bases and moduli to reduce collision probability.; Choose a large prime modulus (e.g., 10^9 + 7) and a random base for robustness.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions are possible; always verify equality for critical applications or use multiple hashes.; Choosing a small or non-prime modulus significantly increases the risk of collisions.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
