// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-smallest-divisor-given-a-threshold/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers nums and an integer threshold, we will choose a positive integer divisor, divide all the array by it, and sum the division's result. Find the smallest divisor such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to threshold.
//
// Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example: 7/3 = 3 and 10/2 = 5).
//
// The test cases are generated so that there will be an answer.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6
// Output: 5
// Explanation: We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1. 
// If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum of 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5 the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 106
// 	nums.length <= threshold <= 106

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to efficiently calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer. It is applicable in number theory problems or combinatorial tasks involving factors.
//   • Idea: This method computes the number of divisors and sum of divisors of an integer n by first finding its prime factorization. The core idea leverages properties of multiplicative functions, with a typical complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for factorization.
//   • Invariants: During prime factorization, temp_n always holds the remaining unfactored part of the original number.; The current_prime_factor iterates through potential prime divisors in increasing order.
//   • Tips: First find the prime factorization n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak.; Number of divisors d(n) = (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the special case of n=1 (1 divisor, sum 1).; Incorrectly calculating powers or sums, especially for large exponents.
// - Primality tests (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to determine if a single number is prime, especially for numbers where trial division up to its square root is computationally feasible.
//   • Idea: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This method checks for primality by attempting to find a non-trivial divisor up to the square root of the given number, running in O(sqrt(N)) time.
//   • Invariants: No integer k in the range [2, current_divisor - 1] has been found to divide n.; The current value current_divisor is a candidate divisor being tested against n.
//   • Tips: Only check numbers between 2 and sqrt(n).; Handle 2 as a special case before iterating.
//   • Pitfalls: O(sqrt(N)) complexity can be too slow for very large numbers.; Incorrectly handling edge cases like 0, 1, or 2.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
