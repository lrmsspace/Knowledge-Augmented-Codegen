// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-ideal-subsequence/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s consisting of lowercase letters and an integer k. We call a string t ideal if the following conditions are satisfied:
//
//
// 	t is a subsequence of the string s.
// 	The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two adjacent letters in t is less than or equal to k.
//
//
// Return the length of the longest ideal string.
//
// A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
//
// Note that the alphabet order is not cyclic. For example, the absolute difference in the alphabet order of 'a' and 'z' is 25, not 1.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "acfgbd", k = 2
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The longest ideal string is "acbd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.
// Note that "acfgbd" is not ideal because 'c' and 'f' have a difference of 3 in alphabet order.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	0 <= k <= 25
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters.

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all palindromic substrings within a given string, or determine the longest palindromic substring, in optimal linear time.
//   • Idea: Manacher's Algorithm efficiently finds the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at each position in a given string, handling both odd and even lengths uniformly via preprocessing. It achieves this in optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: p[i] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at i in the transformed string.; The right_boundary always marks the rightmost extent of the largest palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with a unique delimiter to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage the mirror property around the current center to initialize palindrome radii.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when converting `p` array values back to original string indices or lengths.; Incorrectly handling the boundaries of the preprocessed string.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            int index = ch - 'a';
            int start = Math.max(0, index - k);
            int end = Math.min(25, index + k);
            int currMax = 0;

            for (int j = start; j <= end; j++) {
                currMax = Math.max(currMax, dp[j]);
