// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-subtraction-operation/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.
//
// You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:
//
//
// 	Pick an index i that you haven’t picked before, and pick a prime p strictly less than nums[i], then subtract p from nums[i].
//
//
// Return true if you can make nums a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise.
//
// A strictly increasing array is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [4,9,6,10]
// Output: true
// Explanation: In the first operation: Pick i = 0 and p = 3, and then subtract 3 from nums[0], so that nums becomes [1,9,6,10].
// In the second operation: i = 1, p = 7, subtract 7 from nums[1], so nums becomes equal to [1,2,6,10].
// After the second operation, nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is true.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
// 	nums.length == n
//

// - Linear Sieve (array, sieve)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest prime factor or full prime factorization for all numbers up to a given limit N in linear time. It's particularly useful for tasks requiring precomputed factorizations.
//   • Idea: The Linear Sieve computes the smallest prime factor for every number up to N, ensuring each composite number is marked exactly once by its smallest prime factor. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Every number `i` from 2 to N has its `lp[i]` correctly set to its smallest prime factor.; The `primes` array contains all prime numbers less than or equal to the current iteration `i`.
//   • Tips: Stores the smallest prime factor (lp) for each number.; Efficiently generates all prime numbers up to N.
//   • Pitfalls: Higher memory usage compared to the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes due to storing lp array.; Can be slower in practice than optimized Sieve of Eratosthenes for merely generating primes.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (heap, interval, greedy, simulation)
//   • When to use: When needing to find an optimal schedule for a set of jobs, each with a deadline and duration, typically to maximize completed jobs or minimize total lateness. This approach often involves processing jobs based on deadlines and dynamically selecting tasks.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal job schedule by processing jobs sorted by their deadlines, using a priority queue to manage available tasks. It greedily selects jobs with the shortest run-time that can be completed within the current time window, achieving an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs with deadlines greater than the current job's deadline have been considered.; The priority queue contains jobs that can potentially be scheduled within the current time window.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by deadline in descending order to process later deadlines first.; Use a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve the job with the least run-time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly sorting jobs (e.g., ascending deadline or by duration).; Not handling overlapping time intervals or deadlines properly.
