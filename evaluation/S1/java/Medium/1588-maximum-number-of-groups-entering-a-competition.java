//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a positive integer array grades which represents the grades of students in a university. You would like to enter all these students into a competition in ordered non-empty groups, such that the ordering meets the following conditions:
//
//
// 	The sum of the grades of students in the ith group is less than the sum of the grades of students in the (i + 1)th group, for all groups (except the last).
// 	The total number of students in the ith group is less than the total number of students in the (i + 1)th group, for all groups (except the last).
//
//
// Return the maximum number of groups that can be formed.
//
// Example:
// Input: grades = [10,6,12,7,3,5]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The following is a possible way to form 3 groups of students:
// - 1st group has the students with grades = [12]. Sum of grades: 12. Student count: 1
// - 2nd group has the students with grades = [6,7]. Sum of grades: 6 + 7 = 13. Student count: 2
// - 3rd group has the students with grades = [10,3,5]. Sum of grades: 10 + 3 + 5 = 18. Student count: 3
// It can be shown that it is not possible to form more than 3 groups.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= grades.length <= 105
// 	1 <= grades[i] <= 105
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity sort is required, especially for large datasets or when external sorting is beneficial. It is also suitable for linked lists where random access is inefficient.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo...mid]` and the right subarray `a[mid+1...hi]` are sorted.; During the merge, `a[lo...k-1]` contains the `k-lo` smallest elements from `aux[lo...hi]` in sorted order.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for merging to maintain stability and simplify the merge logic.; Consider the bottom-up iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits and potentially improve cache performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Requires O(N) auxiliary space, which can be a significant concern for memory-constrained environments.; Recursive implementations can lead to stack overflow errors for extremely large input arrays.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: When tasks need to be processed sequentially on a single resource to optimize a cumulative metric like total completion time or weighted sum of completion times.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal sequence for processing jobs on a single machine by applying a greedy strategy, often involving sorting based on specific criteria. It typically achieves an optimal schedule in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The list of jobs is sorted according to the chosen greedy criterion.; For any prefix of the sorted jobs, the current schedule minimizes the objective function for those jobs.
//   • Tips: Identify the correct sorting key (e.g., processing time, weight/time ratio) for the objective function.; Prove optimality using an exchange argument to justify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying an incorrect sorting criterion for the specific optimization objective.; Assuming a greedy approach is always optimal without a formal proof.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
