// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-array-of-prefix-xor/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array pref of size n. Find and return the array arr of size n that satisfies:
//
//
// 	pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i].
//
//
// Note that ^ denotes the bitwise-xor operation.
//
// It can be proven that the answer is unique.
//
// Example:
// Input: pref = [5,2,0,3,1]
// Output: [5,7,2,3,2]
// Explanation: From the array [5,7,2,3,2] we have the following:
// - pref[0] = 5.
// - pref[1] = 5 ^ 7 = 2.
// - pref[2] = 5 ^ 7 ^ 2 = 0.
// - pref[3] = 5 ^ 7 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 3.
// - pref[4] = 5 ^ 7 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 2 = 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= pref.length <= 105
// 	0 <= pref[i] <= 106

// - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, prefix-sum, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compute modular inverses for multiple numbers in an array or a range, especially when efficiency is critical, by leveraging prefix and suffix products to reduce inverse computations.
//   • Idea: This technique efficiently computes modular inverses for multiple numbers by transforming individual inverse calculations into a product of prefix, suffix, and a single overall inverse. It achieves O(N + log M) complexity for an array or O(M) for a range.
//   • Invariants: For 0 <= i < N, prefix_products[i] holds (arr[0] * ... * arr[i-1]) % m.; For 0 <= i < N, suffix_products[i] holds (arr[i+1] * ... * arr[N-1]) % m.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix products and suffix products of the array elements modulo m.; Calculate the modular inverse of the total product of all elements once using modular exponentiation.
//   • Pitfalls: Ensure all numbers for which an inverse is sought are coprime to the modulus m.; Watch for off-by-one errors when calculating prefix and suffix product indices.
// - Gray code (number, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when a sequence of binary numbers is needed where successive values differ by only one bit. This is useful for error detection in digital systems or position encoders.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit position. Conversion from a binary number `n` to its Gray code `G(n)` is `n ^ (n >> 1)`, and the inverse operation can also be performed efficiently in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: For binary to Gray: The resulting Gray code `G(n)` differs from `n` by exactly one bit for each `n`.; For inverse Gray to binary: The variable `n` accumulates the correct binary value from MSB to LSB.
//   • Tips: Understand the core `n ^ (n >> 1)` transformation for binary to Gray.; The inverse Gray code conversion involves iteratively XORing with right-shifted values.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation.; Incorrectly implementing the iterative inverse transformation logic.
// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, sparse-table, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When you need O(1) query time for any associative operation (like sum, min, max, GCD) on a static array, after an O(N log N) preprocessing step.
//   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that supports O(1) range queries for any associative operation on a static array. It achieves this by precomputing results for specific disjoint and overlapping ranges, with an O(N log N) construction time and space complexity.
//   • Invariants: table[k][i] stores the result of the operation for a range of length 2^k starting at index i.; For any query [L, R], the result is obtained by combining two precomputed values from blocks that cover [L, mid] and [mid+1, R].
//   • Tips: Understand the block decomposition based on powers of two for construction.; Queries combine results from two precomputed blocks that cover the query range.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support point updates efficiently; any modification requires a full rebuild.; Higher space complexity of O(N log N) compared to some other range query structures.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
