// Problem Description:
// There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
//
//
// 	For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
//
//
// Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
// To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= numCourses <= 2000
// 	0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
// 	prerequisites[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
// 	All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

// - Topological Sorting (graph, array, dfs, topo)
//   • When to use: Use for graph or tree traversal, pathfinding, cycle detection, or topological sorting in DAGs. It's also suitable for exploring all states in a search space.
//   • Idea: DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically using recursion or an explicit stack. Topological sort orders nodes in a DAG such that for every directed edge u -> v, u comes before v, achievable with DFS in O(V+E) time.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the current path have been explored or are in the recursion stack.; A node is marked 'visited' only after all its descendants have been fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set/array to prevent infinite loops in graphs and redundant computations.; Recursion is natural for DFS, but an explicit stack can avoid recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.; Exceeding recursion depth limits for very deep graphs or trees.
// - Undirected Graphs (graph, matrix, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when modeling symmetric relationships between entities, analyzing graph properties like connectivity or degrees, or simulating processes on a network where connections are bidirectional.
//   • Idea: An undirected graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges, where each edge connects two vertices symmetrically. Basic operations often have a time complexity of O(V+E) or O(V^2) depending on representation.
//   • Invariants: For every edge (u, v) in the graph, the edge (v, u) also exists.; The sum of degrees of all vertices equals twice the number of edges.
//   • Tips: Choose adjacency list for sparse graphs, adjacency matrix for dense graphs.; Degrees of vertices are easily calculated from adjacency representations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to add both (u,v) and (v,u) when using an adjacency matrix or list.; Not handling disconnected components during full graph traversals.
// - Check whether a graph is bipartite (graph, queue, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to determine if an undirected graph can be divided into two independent sets such that all edges connect vertices from different sets, or if it is two-colorable.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if an undirected graph is bipartite by attempting to 2-color it using BFS. It assigns alternating colors (or sets) to adjacent vertices, detecting non-bipartite conditions if an edge connects two vertices of the same color.
//   • Invariants: All visited vertices within the current BFS component are correctly 2-colored.; All edges processed so far connect vertices of different colors.
//   • Tips: Use two distinct colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to represent the two sets.; Iterate through all vertices and start a new BFS from any unvisited vertex to handle disconnected components.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected graphs by ensuring all vertices are visited.; Incorrectly assigning colors, leading to false positives or negatives.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
