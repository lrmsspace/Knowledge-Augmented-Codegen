//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a collection of numbered balls and instructed to sort them into boxes for a nearly balanced distribution. There are two rules you must follow:
//
//
// 	Balls with the same box must have the same value. But, if you have more than one ball with the same number, you can put them in different boxes.
// 	The biggest box can only have one more ball than the smallest box.
//
//
// ​Return the fewest number of boxes to sort these balls following these rules.
//
// Example:
// Input:   balls = [3,2,3,2,3] 
//
// Output:   2 
//
// Explanation:
//
// We can sort balls into boxes as follows:
//
//
// 	[3,3,3]
// 	[2,2]
//
//
// The size difference between the two boxes doesn't exceed one.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When searching for a specific element in a sorted collection or finding an optimal value over a monotonic function within a defined range. It efficiently reduces the search space by half in each step.
//   • Idea: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or determines a value that satisfies a monotonic predicate. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The potential answer always lies within the current search interval `[low, high]`.; All elements strictly less than `low` have been determined not to be the answer.
//   • Tips: Ensure the search space exhibits a monotonic property.; Carefully define the `low` and `high` bounds for the search interval.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating `low` or `high` bounds leading to infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing or loop conditions.
// - Stars and bars (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when counting the number of ways to distribute identical items into distinct bins, or finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a linear equation. It is also applicable for problems with lower bounds on variables.
//   • Idea: Stars and bars is a combinatorial technique used to count the number of ways to place 'n' identical items into 'k' distinct bins, or equivalently, to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + ... + xk = n.
//   • Invariants: The total number of 'stars' (items) remains constant throughout any transformation.; The number of 'bars' (separators) is always one less than the number of bins (variables).
//   • Tips: Visualize items as 'stars' and separators as 'bars' to understand the arrangement.; Transform problems with lower bounds (x_i >= a_i) into non-negative solutions (x_i' >= 0).
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing identical items with distinct items, which requires a different counting method.; Incorrectly applying the formula when variables have lower bounds other than zero without transformation.
// - Minimum Enclosing Circle (array, geometry, randomized, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the smallest circle that contains a given set of 2D points. It provides an expected linear time solution for this fundamental geometric problem.
//   • Idea: Welzl's algorithm finds the unique minimum enclosing circle for a set of points using a randomized incremental approach. It achieves an expected time complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: The current candidate circle `C` encloses all points `p_1, ..., p_i` processed so far.; If `p_i` is not contained in `C_{i-1}`, then `p_i` must lie on the boundary of `C_i`.
//   • Tips: Randomly permute input points to ensure expected O(N) performance.; The MEC is uniquely determined by either two points forming a diameter or three points on its boundary.
//   • Pitfalls: Not randomizing the input can lead to a worst-case O(N^3) performance.; Floating-point precision issues can cause incorrect boundary checks or point containment tests.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int minGroupsForValidAssignment(int[] balls) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        int maxFrequency = 0;

        // Count the frequency of each ball value
        for (int ball : balls) {
            frequencyMap.put(ball, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(ball, 0) + 1);
            maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, frequencyMap.get(ball));
        }

        int left = 1, right = maxFrequency;

        // Binary search to find the minimum number of groups
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canDistribute(frequencyMap, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return left;
