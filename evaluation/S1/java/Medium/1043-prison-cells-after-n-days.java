// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There are 8 prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant.
//
// Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:
//
//
// 	If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
// 	Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
//
//
// Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.
//
// You are given an integer array cells where cells[i] == 1 if the ith cell is occupied and cells[i] == 0 if the ith cell is vacant, and you are given an integer n.
//
// Return the state of the prison after n days (i.e., n such changes described above).
//
// Example:
// Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], n = 7
// Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
// Explanation: The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
// Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
// Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
// Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
// Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
// Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
// Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
// Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
// Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
//
// Constraints:
// cells.length == 8
// 	cells[i] is either 0 or 1.
// 	1 <= n <= 109

// - Simulated Annealing (array, number, randomized, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when seeking a near-optimal solution for complex optimization problems with many local optima, especially when exact solutions are computationally infeasible or too slow.
//   • Idea: Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic metaheuristic for global optimization, inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It explores the search space by accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time, aiming to escape local optima.
//   • Invariants: The `s_best` state always represents the lowest energy found across all iterations so far.; The temperature `T` is always non-negative and decreases monotonically with each iteration.
//   • Tips: Start with a sufficiently high initial temperature to allow broad exploration.; Choose a slow cooling schedule (decay rate) for better solution quality, at the cost of longer runtime.
//   • Pitfalls: Getting stuck in local minima if the cooling schedule is too fast.; Excessive runtime if the cooling schedule is too slow or initial temperature is too high.
// - Finding a negative cycle in the graph (graph, matrix, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find if a negative cycle exists in a graph, especially when dealing with all-pairs shortest paths or when edge weights can be negative. It is suitable for dense graphs.
//   • Idea: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can detect negative cycles by checking if any vertex has a negative distance to itself after all iterations. It computes all-pairs shortest paths in O(V^3) time.
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, dist[i][j] stores the shortest path from i to j using only intermediate vertices from 0 to k-1.; For any i, dist[i][i] remains 0 unless a negative cycle involving i is found.
//   • Tips: Initialize distance matrix with edge weights or infinity for non-existent edges.; Set dist[i][i] to 0 for all i initially.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect initialization of the distance matrix, especially dist[i][i].; Forgetting to check the main diagonal for negative values after computation.
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare strings, find duplicate strings, or perform fast substring searches and pattern matching in O(1) time after initial O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to a numerical value using a polynomial function, enabling O(1) comparison of strings or substrings after O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: prefix_hash[i] stores the polynomial hash of the substring s[0...i-1].; p_power[k] stores p^k mod m for efficient calculation.
//   • Tips: Use two different hash functions with distinct prime `p` and `m` values to minimize collision probability.; Precompute powers of `p` and prefix hashes to enable O(1) substring hash calculation.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions can lead to incorrect results; always consider their possibility.; Integer overflow if modulo operations are not applied correctly at each step of calculation.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
