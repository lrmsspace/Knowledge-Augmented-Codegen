// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has n empty baskets, the ith basket is at position[i], Morty has m balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.
//
// Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.
//
// Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required force.
//
// Example:
// Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.
//
// Constraints:
// n == position.length
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= position[i] <= 109
// 	All integers in position are distinct.
// 	2 <= m <= position.length

// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or external sorting where data might not fit in memory.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and requires O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: The elements `index[lo...k-1]` are sorted and contain the smallest `k-lo` elements from the original `aux[lo...mid]` and `aux[mid+1...hi]` segments.; Pointer `i` always indicates the next element to consider from the left sorted sub-array (`aux[lo...mid]`).
//   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to ensure stability.; Consider an iterative bottom-up approach to avoid recursion overhead.
//   • Pitfalls: High auxiliary space complexity (O(N)) can be a concern for memory-constrained systems.; Recursive calls can lead to stack overflow for very large inputs without tail call optimization.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - bucket-sort (array, bucket-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting elements with a known, uniform distribution over a specific range. It is efficient for numbers that are uniformly distributed across a range, often achieving linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates them. It can achieve O(N+K) average time complexity for uniformly distributed data.
//   • Invariants: After distributing elements, each element `x` is in bucket `floor(N * x)`.; After sorting buckets, every bucket `buckets[i]` contains its elements in sorted order.
//   • Tips: Choose the number of buckets appropriately based on data distribution and range.; Normalize input data to a [0, 1) range for simpler bucket indexing.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor performance with non-uniform data distribution, potentially degrading to O(N^2).; Requires extra space for the buckets, proportional to N+K.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
