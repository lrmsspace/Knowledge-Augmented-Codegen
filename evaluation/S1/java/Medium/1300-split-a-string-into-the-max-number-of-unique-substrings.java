// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-into-the-max-number-of-unique-substrings/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.
//
// You can split string s into any list of non-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique.
//
// A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "ababccc"
// Output: 5
// Explanation: One way to split maximally is ['a', 'b', 'ab', 'c', 'cc']. Splitting like ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'cc'] is not valid as you have 'a' and 'b' multiple times.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 16
// 	
// 	
// 	s contains only lower case English letters.

// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, tree, string, recursion)
//   • When to use: When needing to efficiently represent all substrings of a string and perform various string operations like counting occurrences, finding distinct substrings, or pattern matching. It is particularly useful for problems involving properties of all substrings or suffixes.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal deterministic finite automaton that accepts all suffixes of a given string. It efficiently encodes all substrings and their occurrences, typically constructed in O(N) time and space for a string of length N.
//   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton corresponds to a unique endpos set.; All substrings represented by a state are suffixes of the longest string in that state's endpos set.
//   • Tips: Understand the endpos equivalence classes and suffix links.; Construction is typically incremental, character by character.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of implementation can be high due to many edge cases.; Incorrectly handling suffix links during construction.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
