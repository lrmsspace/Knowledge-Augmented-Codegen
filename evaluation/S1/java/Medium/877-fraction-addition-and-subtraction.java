// Problem Description:
// Given a string expression representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, return the calculation result in string format.
//
// The final result should be an irreducible fraction. If your final result is an integer, change it to the format of a fraction that has a denominator 1. So in this case, 2 should be converted to 2/1.
//
// Example:
// Input: expression = "-1/2+1/2"
// Output: "0/1"
//
// Constraints:
// The input string only contains '0' to '9', '/', '+' and '-'. So does the output.
// 	Each fraction (input and output) has the format ±numerator/denominator. If the first input fraction or the output is positive, then '+' will be omitted.
// 	The input only contains valid irreducible fractions, where the numerator and denominator of each fraction will always be in the range [1, 10]. If the denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format defined above.
// 	The number of given fractions will be in the range [1, 10].
// 	The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be valid and in the range of 32-bit int.

// - Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (number, gcd)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the greatest common divisor of two or more integers, or as a subroutine for tasks like simplifying fractions or finding the least common multiple.
//   • Idea: The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log min(a, b)).
//   • Invariants: The greatest common divisor of the current pair (a, b) remains constant and equal to the GCD of the original inputs.; The second number (b) is always non-negative.
//   • Tips: Handle the base case where one of the numbers is zero; gcd(a, 0) = a.; The algorithm works for any order of inputs; if a < b, the first step swaps them effectively.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to take absolute values if negative inputs are possible, as GCD is typically defined for non-negative integers.; Incorrectly handling the zero input case, which can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.
// - Continued fractions (number, matrix-exp, segment-tree, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to represent real numbers as a sequence of integers, find optimal rational approximations, or solve certain number theoretic problems involving linear equations or quadratic irrationals.
//   • Idea: Continued fractions represent real numbers as an expression of the form a0 + 1/(a1 + 1/(a2 + ...)), providing a systematic way to find best rational approximations. They are fundamental in number theory, with convergent computation typically O(log N) for N terms.
//   • Invariants: The sequence of partial quotients (a_i) are positive integers for i >= 1.; Each convergent p_k/q_k is a best rational approximation of the original number.
//   • Tips: Understand the recursive definition and how to compute convergents.; The Euclidean algorithm is the basis for finite continued fractions.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues when computing directly.; Incorrectly handling the base case or termination condition.
// - Primality tests (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to determine if a single number is prime, especially for numbers where trial division up to its square root is computationally feasible.
//   • Idea: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This method checks for primality by attempting to find a non-trivial divisor up to the square root of the given number, running in O(sqrt(N)) time.
//   • Invariants: No integer k in the range [2, current_divisor - 1] has been found to divide n.; The current value current_divisor is a candidate divisor being tested against n.
//   • Tips: Only check numbers between 2 and sqrt(n).; Handle 2 as a special case before iterating.
//   • Pitfalls: O(sqrt(N)) complexity can be too slow for very large numbers.; Incorrectly handling edge cases like 0, 1, or 2.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
