// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-kth-largest-integer-in-the-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of strings nums and an integer k. Each string in nums represents an integer without leading zeros.
//
// Return the string that represents the kth largest integer in nums.
//
// Note: Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if nums is ["1","2","2"], "2" is the first largest integer, "2" is the second-largest integer, and "1" is the third-largest integer.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = ["3","6","7","10"], k = 4
// Output: "3"
// Explanation:
// The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["3","6","7","10"].
// The 4th largest integer in nums is "3".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 104
// 	1 <= nums[i].length <= 100
// 	nums[i] consists of only digits.
// 	nums[i] will not have any leading zeros.

// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
// - String Sorts (array, string, number, radix-sort, counting-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting a large collection of fixed-length strings or integers, especially when the key range (alphabet size) is small. It is efficient for data with uniform key lengths.
//   • Idea: LSD Radix Sort sorts elements by processing digits or characters from the least significant to the most significant, using a stable counting sort for each position. It achieves a time complexity of O(W * (N + R)), where W is the key length, N is the number of items, and R is the radix.
//   • Invariants: After each pass 'd' (from 'w-1' down to '0'), the array 'a' is stably sorted based on characters from position 'd' to 'w-1'.; The 'count' array accurately reflects the frequency of each character at the current digit 'd' before cumulation.
//   • Tips: Utilize counting sort as the stable inner sorting algorithm for each digit pass.; Process characters or digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for variable-length strings without proper padding or specialized handling.; Can be slower than comparison sorts for small input sizes or very large radix (R).
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
