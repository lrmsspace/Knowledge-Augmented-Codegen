// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-minimum-and-maximum-from-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array of distinct integers nums.
//
// There is an element in nums that has the lowest value and an element that has the highest value. We call them the minimum and maximum respectively. Your goal is to remove both these elements from the array.
//
// A deletion is defined as either removing an element from the front of the array or removing an element from the back of the array.
//
// Return the minimum number of deletions it would take to remove both the minimum and maximum element from the array.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,10,7,5,4,1,8,6]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: 
// The minimum element in the array is nums[5], which is 1.
// The maximum element in the array is nums[1], which is 10.
// We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 2 elements from the front and 3 elements from the back.
// This results in 2 + 3 = 5 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	The integers in nums are distinct.

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
//   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
//   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
//   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.
// - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (queue, stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query the minimum element of a stack or queue in O(1) average time. Also applicable for finding minimums in all fixed-length subarrays using a sliding window.
//   • Idea: This technique augments a stack or queue to support O(1) average time retrieval of its minimum element, typically by storing minimums alongside data or using auxiliary structures. It achieves amortized constant time for all operations.
//   • Invariants: For a minimum stack, the auxiliary minimum stack's top element is always the minimum of all elements currently in the main stack.; For a minimum queue implemented with two stacks, the output stack is only refilled from the input stack when the output stack becomes empty.
//   • Tips: For a minimum stack, use an auxiliary stack to store minimums encountered so far.; Only push to the auxiliary minimum stack if the new element is less than or equal to its current top.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to pop from the auxiliary minimum stack when the main stack's top is removed.; Incorrectly handling the transfer logic between the two stacks for a minimum queue.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int minIndex = 0, maxIndex = 0;

        // Find indices of minimum and maximum elements
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[minIndex]) {
                minIndex = i;
            }
            if (nums[i] > nums[maxIndex]) {
                maxIndex = i;
            }
        }

        // Ensure minIndex is less than maxIndex for easier calculations
        if (minIndex > maxIndex) {
            int temp = minIndex;
            minIndex = maxIndex;
            maxIndex = temp;
        }

        // Calculate the number of deletions for different strategies
        int deleteFromFront = maxIndex + 1; // Remove both from the front
        int deleteFromBack = n - minIndex;   // Remove both from the back
        int deleteFromBothSides = (minIndex + 1) + (n - maxIndex); // Remove min from front and max from back

        // Return the minimum deletions required
        return Math.min(deleteFromFront, Math.min(deleteFromBack, deleteFromBothSides));            
    }
