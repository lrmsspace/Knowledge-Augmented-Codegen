// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-shortest-superstring/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of strings words, return the smallest string that contains each string in words as a substring. If there are multiple valid strings of the smallest length, return any of them.
//
// You may assume that no string in words is a substring of another string in words.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
// Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
// Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 12
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 20
// 	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
// 	All the strings of words are unique.

// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
