//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:
//
//
// 	Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
// 	Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
// "11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
// "01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= n <= 109
//

// - Gray code (number, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when a sequence of binary numbers is needed where successive values differ by only one bit. This is useful for error detection in digital systems or position encoders.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit position. Conversion from a binary number `n` to its Gray code `G(n)` is `n ^ (n >> 1)`, and the inverse operation can also be performed efficiently in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: For binary to Gray: The resulting Gray code `G(n)` differs from `n` by exactly one bit for each `n`.; For inverse Gray to binary: The variable `n` accumulates the correct binary value from MSB to LSB.
//   • Tips: Understand the core `n ^ (n >> 1)` transformation for binary to Gray.; The inverse Gray code conversion involves iteratively XORing with right-shifted values.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation.; Incorrectly implementing the iterative inverse transformation logic.
// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {
        int gray = n ^ (n >> 1); // Convert n to its Gray code representation
        int result = 0;
        int bit = 1;

        // Convert Gray code back to binary to get the minimum operations
        while (gray > 0) {
            if ((gray & 1) == 1) {
                result ^= bit;
