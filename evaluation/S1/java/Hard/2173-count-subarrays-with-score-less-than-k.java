// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-score-less-than-k/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// The score of an array is defined as the product of its sum and its length.
//
//
// 	For example, the score of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * 5 = 75.
//
//
// Given a positive integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays of nums whose score is strictly less than k.
//
// A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,1,4,3,5], k = 10
// Output: 6
// Explanation:
// The 6 subarrays having scores less than 10 are:
// - [2] with score 2 * 1 = 2.
// - [1] with score 1 * 1 = 1.
// - [4] with score 4 * 1 = 4.
// - [3] with score 3 * 1 = 3. 
// - [5] with score 5 * 1 = 5.
// - [2,1] with score (2 + 1) * 2 = 6.
// Note that subarrays such as [1,4] and [4,3,5] are not considered because their scores are 10 and 36 respectively, while we need scores strictly less than 10.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= k <= 1015
//

// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, ds, sliding-window, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when performing frequent range queries and point updates on an array, especially when a segment tree is too complex or memory-intensive, or when query types are diverse. It offers a balanced time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and point updates. It achieves O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations.
//   • Invariants: Each element `arr[i]` belongs to exactly one block `block[i / block_size]`.; The summary for each block `block_summary[j]` accurately reflects the state of elements within block `j`.
//   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for balanced performance.; Precompute block summaries (e.g., sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or boundaries.; Forgetting to update the block's summary after a point update.
// - Lattice points inside non-lattice polygon (geometry, number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to count integer coordinate points strictly inside a polygon whose vertices are not restricted to integer coordinates. It's suitable for problems requiring precise geometric counting with non-lattice boundaries.
//   • Idea: This algorithm counts lattice points within a polygon with arbitrary vertices by summing signed contributions from each edge. It reduces the problem to evaluating sums of floor functions, sum(floor(kx+b)), which is solved recursively, typically achieving logarithmic complexity per edge.
//   • Invariants: The sum sum(floor(kx+b)) correctly accumulates points below the current edge segment.; After coordinate transformations, the problem reduces to a sum over a non-negative range with non-negative k and b.
//   • Tips: Decompose the polygon into signed areas under each edge, similar to the shoelace formula.; Handle edge cases where k or b are negative by appropriate transformations.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues when calculating k and b or during transformations.; Incorrectly handling boundary points (points on edges or vertices).
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
