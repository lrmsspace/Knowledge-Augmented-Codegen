//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.
//
// Example:
// Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
// Output: 3
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= points.length <= 300
// 	points[i].length == 2
// 	-104 <= xi, yi <= 104
// 	All the points are unique.

// - Convex Hull construction (geometry, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a plane. It is fundamental for various geometric algorithms and optimization problems.
//   • Idea: Convex hull construction identifies the subset of points that form the vertices of the smallest convex polygon containing all given points. Common algorithms achieve this in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sequence of points currently forming the hull maintains a convex property.; All points considered up to the current iteration are either part of the hull or lie within the polygon defined by the hull.
//   • Tips: Sort points by X-coordinate (and Y for ties) as a common preprocessing step.; Consider algorithms like Graham Scan or Monotone Chain for efficiency.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect orientation calculations.; Incorrectly handling collinear points can result in non-minimal hulls or errors.
// - Hash Tables (array, number, string, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently by transforming keys into array indices, managing potential collisions.
//   • Idea: Hash tables map keys to array indices using a hash function, enabling average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups by efficiently managing potential collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash function always produces an index within the valid array bounds [0, M-1].; For any two equal keys, their hash values remain identical.
//   • Tips: Design hash functions for uniform key distribution across the array.; Ensure hash functions are deterministic and efficient to compute.
//   • Pitfalls: Using a hash function that does not uniformly distribute keys, leading to many collisions.; Failing to implement a proper collision resolution strategy.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
