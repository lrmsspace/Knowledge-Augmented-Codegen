// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-consecutive-elements-in-an-array-after-modification/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.
//
// Initially, you can increase the value of any element in the array by at most 1.
//
// After that, you need to select one or more elements from the final array such that those elements are consecutive when sorted in increasing order. For example, the elements [3, 4, 5] are consecutive while [3, 4, 6] and [1, 1, 2, 3] are not.
//
// Return the maximum number of elements that you can select.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,1,5,1,1]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can increase the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,1,5,2,1].
// We select the elements [3,1,5,2,1] and we sort them to obtain [1,2,3], which are consecutive.
// It can be shown that we cannot select more than 3 consecutive elements.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 106
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
