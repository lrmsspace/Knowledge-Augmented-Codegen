// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D array of axis-aligned rectangles. Each rectangle[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2] denotes the ith rectangle where (xi1, yi1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (xi2, yi2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner.
//
// Calculate the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane. Any area covered by two or more rectangles should only be counted once.
//
// Return the total area. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: A total area of 6 is covered by all three rectangles, as illustrated in the picture.
// From (1,1) to (2,2), the green and red rectangles overlap.
// From (1,0) to (2,3), all three rectangles overlap.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= rectangles.length <= 200
// 	rectanges[i].length == 4
// 	0 <= xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2 <= 109
// 	xi1 <= xi2
// 	yi1 <= yi2
// 	All rectangles have non zero area.

// - Search for a pair of intersecting segments (tree, geometry, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently determine if any pair of line segments in a given set intersect. It is particularly effective for detecting geometric overlaps in a 2D plane.
//   • Idea: This algorithm processes segments by sweeping a vertical line across the plane, maintaining an ordered set of active segments to efficiently check for intersections with neighbors. It achieves an optimal time complexity of O(N log N).
//   • Invariants: The sweep line always moves from left to right, processing events in increasing x-coordinate order.; The set of active segments contains all segments currently intersected by the sweep line, ordered by their y-coordinate at the sweep line's current x-position.
//   • Tips: Process events at the same x-coordinate by adding segments before removing them to catch vertex intersections.; Use a balanced binary search tree (e.g., `std::set`) to maintain active segments, ordered by their y-coordinate.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect event ordering (e.g., removing before adding) can lead to missing intersections at shared endpoints.; Floating point precision issues can cause incorrect intersection detection or ordering of segments.
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
// - Segment Tree (tree, array, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to perform range queries (like sum, min, max) and point or range updates on an array efficiently, typically in logarithmic time.
//   • Idea: A Segment Tree is a tree-based data structure that stores information about array intervals, enabling efficient O(log n) range queries and point/range updates.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree represents a contiguous subsegment of the original array.; The value stored in a non-leaf node is an aggregation of the values from its direct children.
//   • Tips: Build the tree recursively, dividing the array into halves.; Use lazy propagation for efficient range updates to avoid O(N) updates.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when defining segment boundaries or array indices.; Forgetting to push down lazy tags before querying or updating children nodes.
