// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-squareful-arrays/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// An array is squareful if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a perfect square.
//
// Given an integer array nums, return the number of permutations of nums that are squareful.
//
// Two permutations perm1 and perm2 are different if there is some index i such that perm1[i] != perm2[i].
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,17,8]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 12
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent range queries and point/range updates are needed on an array, offering a balanced O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations. It's a good alternative when a segment tree is too complex or overkill.
//   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and updates. It achieves an O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both query and update operations.
//   • Invariants: Each block maintains an up-to-date aggregate of its elements.; For any query, fully contained blocks are processed using their precomputed aggregates.
//   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for optimal balance.; Precompute block aggregates (sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling partial blocks or boundary conditions.; Off-by-one errors in block indices or element indices within blocks.
// - Depth-first search (graph, array, stack, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS when you need to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, detect cycles, or perform topological sorting in a graph. It is suitable for problems requiring deep exploration before backtracking.
//   • Idea: Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically running in O(V + E) time for graphs.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently on the recursion stack (or explicit stack) are part of the current path from the source.; Once a node `v` is marked `visited`, it will not be processed again by the main traversal logic.
//   • Tips: Use a `visited` array or set to track explored nodes.; Pass the parent node in recursive calls to correctly detect cycles.
//   • Pitfalls: Risk of stack overflow for very deep graphs with recursive implementations.; Failure to use a `visited` array leads to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
