// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/similar-string-groups/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Two strings, X and Y, are considered similar if either they are identical or we can make them equivalent by swapping at most two letters (in distinct positions) within the string X.
//
// For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".
//
// Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.
//
// We are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. How many groups are there?
//
// Example:
// Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
// Output: 2
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= strs.length <= 300
// 	1 <= strs[i].length <= 300
// 	strs[i] consists of lowercase letters only.
// 	All words in strs have the same length and are anagrams of each other.

// - Finding Bridges Online (graph, tree, union-find, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to dynamically track bridges and 2-edge-connected components in a graph as edges are added. It efficiently updates the graph structure and bridge count in an online fashion.
//   • Idea: This algorithm maintains 2-edge-connected components and bridges in a graph as edges are added, using a Union-Find structure to manage components and a forest to represent the relationships between them. It typically achieves near-amortized constant time per edge addition.
//   • Invariants: Each 2-edge-connected component is represented by a single root in the Union-Find structure.; The set of bridges forms a forest where each node is a 2-edge-connected component.
//   • Tips: Represent 2-edge-connected components using Union-Find for efficient merging.; Maintain a forest where nodes are 2-edge-connected components and edges are bridges.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying when an edge forms a cycle with existing bridges.; Failing to update the bridge count accurately when bridges are removed.
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compare strings or substrings quickly, reducing comparison time from linear to constant. It is ideal for problems requiring frequent string equality checks or pattern matching across large texts.
//   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to an integer hash value, allowing for O(1) equality checks between strings or substrings. This technique relies on a hash function where equal strings must produce equal hashes, though the reverse is not guaranteed.
//   • Invariants: The hash of any prefix s[0...i] is correctly computed based on s[0...i-1] and s[i].; All characters processed up to the current index i contribute to the current hash value.
//   • Tips: Use a polynomial rolling hash function with a prime base and a large prime modulus.; Employ double hashing (two different bases/moduli) to significantly reduce collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions: Different strings can produce the same hash, leading to false positives if not handled.; Poor choice of base or modulus can lead to more frequent collisions.
// - Search for connected components in a graph (graph, dfs, bfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to partition an undirected graph into maximal connected subgraphs where every node is reachable from every other node within its subgraph.
//   • Idea: This algorithm identifies all connected components in an undirected graph by iteratively performing graph traversals (DFS or BFS) from unvisited nodes. It has a time complexity of O(V + E) for adjacency list representation.
//   • Invariants: All nodes visited so far belong to an identified connected component.; Any node currently being visited is part of the current connected component being explored.
//   • Tips: Maintain a visited array or set to track processed nodes.; Iterate through all nodes, starting a new traversal if a node is unvisited.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to iterate through all nodes to find all components in a disconnected graph.; Not correctly marking nodes as visited during traversal, leading to infinite loops or re-processing.
