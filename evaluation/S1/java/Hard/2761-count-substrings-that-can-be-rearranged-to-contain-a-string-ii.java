// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-that-can-be-rearranged-to-contain-a-string-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two strings word1 and word2.
//
// A string x is called valid if x can be rearranged to have word2 as a prefix.
//
// Return the total number of valid substrings of word1.
//
// Note that the memory limits in this problem are smaller than usual, so you must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity.
//
// Example:
// Input: word1 = "bcca", word2 = "abc"
//
// Output: 1
//
// Explanation:
//
// The only valid substring is "bcca" which can be rearranged to "abcc" having "abc" as a prefix.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= word1.length <= 106
// 	1 <= word2.length <= 104
// 	word1 and word2 consist only of lowercase English letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Suffix Array (string, array, counting-sort, radix-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently query or analyze all suffixes of a string, often for pattern matching, string searching, or finding repeated substrings. It provides a sorted order of all suffixes.
//   • Idea: The Suffix Array algorithm constructs an array containing the starting indices of all suffixes of a string, sorted lexicographically. It typically uses a doubling strategy with counting sort or radix sort in each step, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After iteration k, p contains the sorted indices of all cyclic substrings of length 2^k.; After iteration k, c[i] represents the equivalence class of the cyclic substring starting at i with length 2^k.
//   • Tips: Append a unique, smallest character (e.g., '$') to the string to handle suffixes as cyclic shifts.; Utilize counting sort for efficient sorting of characters and pairs of equivalence classes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the sentinel character can lead to incorrect suffix order or out-of-bounds access.; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices for cyclic shifts or substring lengths.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Z-function and its calculation (string, array, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the length of the longest common prefix between a string and all its suffixes efficiently. It is fundamental for various string matching and pattern searching problems.
//   • Idea: The Z-function computes an array where each element z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the original string and its suffix starting at index i. This algorithm calculates the entire Z-array in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For all k < i, z[k] has been correctly computed.; The interval [l, r) always represents the rightmost segment match found so far.
//   • Tips: Leverage previously computed Z-values to avoid redundant comparisons.; Maintain a [l, r) window representing the rightmost segment match found so far.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the base case z[0] (usually set to 0).; Off-by-one errors when calculating the length of the prefix or updating the window.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
