// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-operations-with-the-same-score-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of integers nums. Consider the following operation:
//
//
// 	Delete the first two elements nums and define the score of the operation as the sum of these two elements.
//
//
// You can perform this operation until nums contains fewer than two elements. Additionally, the same score must be achieved in all operations.
//
// Return the maximum number of operations you can perform.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,2,1,4,5]
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	We can perform the first operation with the score 3 + 2 = 5. After this operation, nums = [1,4,5].
// 	We can perform the second operation as its score is 4 + 1 = 5, the same as the previous operation. After this operation, nums = [5].
// 	As there are fewer than two elements, we can't perform more operations.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
//

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, number, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the optimal sequence of jobs to minimize the total completion time (makespan) on two machines, with a fixed processing order (machine 1 then machine 2) for all jobs.
//   • Idea: This problem involves ordering N jobs, each with two processing times (one for each machine), to minimize the overall makespan. Johnson's rule provides an optimal greedy solution for this specific two-machine flow shop problem in O(N log N) or O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed so far maintain the optimal relative order determined by Johnson's rule.; The current makespan is the minimum possible for the jobs already scheduled.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs based on Johnson's rule criteria: jobs with min(a_i, b_i).; Prioritize jobs with shorter machine 1 times or longer machine 2 times for early scheduling.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying Johnson's rule to problems with more than two machines, where it is not optimal.; Incorrectly sorting jobs within the two partitioned sets.
// - Simulated Annealing (array, number, randomized, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when seeking a near-optimal solution for complex optimization problems with many local optima, especially when exact solutions are computationally infeasible or too slow.
//   • Idea: Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic metaheuristic for global optimization, inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It explores the search space by accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time, aiming to escape local optima.
//   • Invariants: The `s_best` state always represents the lowest energy found across all iterations so far.; The temperature `T` is always non-negative and decreases monotonically with each iteration.
//   • Tips: Start with a sufficiently high initial temperature to allow broad exploration.; Choose a slow cooling schedule (decay rate) for better solution quality, at the cost of longer runtime.
//   • Pitfalls: Getting stuck in local minima if the cooling schedule is too fast.; Excessive runtime if the cooling schedule is too slow or initial temperature is too high.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    public int maxOperations(int[] nums) {
        int maxOps = 0;
        int n = nums.length;

        // Try every possible target score from 2 to 2000 (since nums[i] <= 1000)
        for (int target = 2; target <= 2000; target++) {
            boolean[] used = new boolean[n];
            int currentOps = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (used[i]) continue;

                for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    if (!used[j] && nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                        used[i] = true;
