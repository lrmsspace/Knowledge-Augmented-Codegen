// Problem Description:
// Given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix matrix, create a new 0-indexed matrix called answer. Make answer equal to matrix, then replace each element with the value -1 with the maximum element in its respective column.
//
// Return the matrix answer.
//
// Example:
// Input: matrix = [[1,2,-1],[4,-1,6],[7,8,9]]
// Output: [[1,2,9],[4,8,6],[7,8,9]]
// Explanation: The diagram above shows the elements that are changed (in blue).
// - We replace the value in the cell [1][1] with the maximum value in the column 1, that is 8.
// - We replace the value in the cell [0][2] with the maximum value in the column 2, that is 9.
//
// Constraints:
// m == matrix.length
// 	n == matrix[i].length
// 	2 <= m, n <= 50
// 	-1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100
// 	The input is generated such that each column contains at least one non-negative integer.

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Gauss method for solving system of linea (bitset, matrix, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the number of solutions (zero, one, or infinite) for a system of linear equations, or to find the unique solution if it exists. It is suitable for solving systems represented as an augmented matrix.
//   • Idea: Gaussian elimination systematically transforms an augmented matrix into row echelon form using elementary row operations to solve a system of linear equations. It determines the existence and values of solutions in O(N^3) time for an N x N system.
//   • Invariants: The submatrix formed by rows 0 to current_row - 1 is in row echelon form.; For the current column, all elements below the pivot in previous columns are zero.
//   • Tips: Use a small epsilon for floating-point comparisons to handle precision issues.; Implement partial pivoting to enhance numerical stability by selecting the largest absolute value.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to account for floating-point precision errors can lead to incorrect results.; Improper handling of free variables can misrepresent infinite solution sets.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
//   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
//   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int[][] modifiedMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;

        // Step 1: Find the maximum value in each column
        int[] maxInColumn = new int[n];
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int maxVal = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] > maxVal) {
                    maxVal = matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
            maxInColumn[j] = maxVal;
        }

        // Step 2: Create the answer matrix and replace -1 with the column maximum
        int[][] answer = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == -1) {
                    answer[i][j] = maxInColumn[j];
                } else {
                    answer[i][j] = matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        return answer;
