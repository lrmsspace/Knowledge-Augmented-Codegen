//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s representing a 12-hour format time where some of the digits (possibly none) are replaced with a "?".
//
// 12-hour times are formatted as "HH:MM", where HH is between 00 and 11, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 12-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 11:59.
//
// You have to replace all the "?" characters in s with digits such that the time we obtain by the resulting string is a valid 12-hour format time and is the latest possible.
//
// Return the resulting string.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "1?:?4"
//
// Output: "11:54"
//
// Explanation: The latest 12-hour format time we can achieve by replacing "?" characters is "11:54".
//
// Constraints:
// s.length == 5
// 	s[2] is equal to the character ":".
// 	All characters except s[2] are digits or "?" characters.
// 	The input is generated such that there is at least one time between "00:00" and "11:59" that you can obtain after replacing the "?" characters.

// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (heap, interval, greedy, simulation)
//   • When to use: When needing to find an optimal schedule for a set of jobs, each with a deadline and duration, typically to maximize completed jobs or minimize total lateness. This approach often involves processing jobs based on deadlines and dynamically selecting tasks.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal job schedule by processing jobs sorted by their deadlines, using a priority queue to manage available tasks. It greedily selects jobs with the shortest run-time that can be completed within the current time window, achieving an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs with deadlines greater than the current job's deadline have been considered.; The priority queue contains jobs that can potentially be scheduled within the current time window.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by deadline in descending order to process later deadlines first.; Use a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve the job with the least run-time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly sorting jobs (e.g., ascending deadline or by duration).; Not handling overlapping time intervals or deadlines properly.
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
