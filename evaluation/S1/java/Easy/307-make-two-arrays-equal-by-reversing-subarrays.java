// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/make-two-arrays-equal-by-reversing-subarrays/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr. In one step, you can select any non-empty subarray of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.
//
// Return true if you can make arr equal to target or false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
// Output: true
// Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
// 1- Reverse subarray [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
// 2- Reverse subarray [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
// 3- Reverse subarray [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
// There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.
//
// Constraints:
// target.length == arr.length
// 	1 <= target.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= target[i] <= 1000
// 	1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

// - Suffix Array (string, array, counting-sort, radix-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently query or analyze all suffixes of a string, often for pattern matching, string searching, or finding repeated substrings. It provides a sorted order of all suffixes.
//   • Idea: The Suffix Array algorithm constructs an array containing the starting indices of all suffixes of a string, sorted lexicographically. It typically uses a doubling strategy with counting sort or radix sort in each step, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After iteration k, p contains the sorted indices of all cyclic substrings of length 2^k.; After iteration k, c[i] represents the equivalence class of the cyclic substring starting at i with length 2^k.
//   • Tips: Append a unique, smallest character (e.g., '$') to the string to handle suffixes as cyclic shifts.; Utilize counting sort for efficient sorting of characters and pairs of equivalence classes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the sentinel character can lead to incorrect suffix order or out-of-bounds access.; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices for cyclic shifts or substring lengths.
// - Stars and bars (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when counting the number of ways to distribute identical items into distinct bins, or finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a linear equation. It is also applicable for problems with lower bounds on variables.
//   • Idea: Stars and bars is a combinatorial technique used to count the number of ways to place 'n' identical items into 'k' distinct bins, or equivalently, to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + ... + xk = n.
//   • Invariants: The total number of 'stars' (items) remains constant throughout any transformation.; The number of 'bars' (separators) is always one less than the number of bins (variables).
//   • Tips: Visualize items as 'stars' and separators as 'bars' to understand the arrangement.; Transform problems with lower bounds (x_i >= a_i) into non-negative solutions (x_i' >= 0).
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing identical items with distinct items, which requires a different counting method.; Incorrectly applying the formula when variables have lower bounds other than zero without transformation.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    public boolean canBeEqual(int[] target, int[] arr) {

        }
