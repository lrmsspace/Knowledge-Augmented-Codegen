//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.
//
// The concatenation of two numbers is the number formed by concatenating their numerals.
//
//
// 	For example, the concatenation of 15, 49 is 1549.
//
//
// The concatenation value of nums is initially equal to 0. Perform this operation until nums becomes empty:
//
//
// 	If nums has a size greater than one, add the value of the concatenation of the first and the last element to the concatenation value of nums, and remove those two elements from nums. For example, if the nums was [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], add 16 to the concatenation value.
// 	If only one element exists in nums, add its value to the concatenation value of nums, then remove it.
//
//
// Return the concatenation value of nums.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [7,52,2,4]
// Output: 596
// Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [7,52,2,4] and concatenation value is 0.
//  - In the first operation:
// We pick the first element, 7, and the last element, 4.
// Their concatenation is 74, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 74.
// Then we delete them from nums, so nums becomes equal to [52,2].
//  - In the second operation:
// We pick the first element, 52, and the last element, 2.
// Their concatenation is 522, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 596.
// Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes empty.
// Since the concatenation value is 596 so the answer is 596.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 104
//

// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
//   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
//   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
// - Bit manipulation (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when operations on individual bits of an integer are required, for optimizing arithmetic with powers of two, or for efficient management of boolean flags.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators and shifts. These operations typically have O(1) time complexity as they are hardware-level instructions.
//   • Invariants: The total number of bits representing the integer remains constant for fixed-width types.; Applying `n & (1 << k)` isolates the k-th bit, setting all other bits to zero.
//   • Tips: Use `&` with `(1 << k)` to check if the k-th bit is set.; Use `|` with `(1 << k)` to set the k-th bit.
//   • Pitfalls: Be aware of integer overflow when performing large left shifts.; Understand the difference between arithmetic and logical right shifts, especially for signed numbers.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
