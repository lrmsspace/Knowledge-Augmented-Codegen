// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-substring-with-two-occurrences/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s, return the maximum length of a substring such that it contains at most two occurrences of each character.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "bcbbbcba"
//
// Output: 4
//
// Explanation:
// The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "bcbbbcba".
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= s.length <= 100
// 	s consists only of lowercase English letters.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Suffix array (array, string, suffix-array, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently perform various string operations like pattern searching, finding repeated substrings, or comparing suffixes lexicographically on a given text. It is a fundamental data structure for advanced string algorithms.
//   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string. It allows for efficient string operations, with construction typically achievable in O(N log N) or O(N) time for advanced algorithms.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array SA[i] stores the starting index of the i-th lexicographically smallest suffix.; All suffixes of the input string are present exactly once in the suffix array.
//   • Tips: Consider using SA-IS for optimal O(N) construction time and space complexity.; Pair the suffix array with an LCP array for enhanced functionality, such as finding longest common substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive O(N^2 log N) construction is too slow for large input strings.; Implementing linear-time algorithms like SA-IS or DC3 can be complex and error-prone.
// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently compare strings or substrings, detect duplicates, or perform pattern matching in large text datasets. It's particularly useful for speeding up operations that would otherwise be O(N*M) or O(N^2).
//   • Idea: String hashing maps strings to numerical values, allowing for fast comparisons and operations like substring search. It typically uses a polynomial rolling hash function, achieving O(N) preprocessing and O(1) or O(log N) query time for substrings.
//   • Invariants: The hash of any prefix of the string is correctly computed based on its characters and chosen parameters.; For a rolling hash, the hash of the current window is always maintained correctly as the window slides.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime modulus (or two) to minimize collision probability.; Select a base (prime number) larger than the alphabet size to ensure unique contributions from characters.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions are possible and can lead to incorrect results if not properly handled or verified.; A poorly chosen base or modulus can significantly increase the frequency of collisions.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int maximumLengthSubstring(String s) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        int n = s.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int[] charCount = new int[26];
            int currentLength = 0;

            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                char c = s.charAt(j);
                charCount[c - 'a']++;

                if (charCount[c - 'a'] > 2) {
                    break;
                }

                currentLength++;
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        }

        return maxLength;           
    }
