// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n representing the number of players in a game and a 2D array pick where pick[i] = [xi, yi] represents that the player xi picked a ball of color yi.
//
// Player i wins the game if they pick strictly more than i balls of the same color. In other words,
//
//
// 	Player 0 wins if they pick any ball.
// 	Player 1 wins if they pick at least two balls of the same color.
// 	...
// 	Player i wins if they pick at least i + 1 balls of the same color.
//
//
// Return the number of players who win the game.
//
// Note that multiple players can win the game.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, pick = [[0,0],[1,0],[1,0],[2,1],[2,1],[2,0]]
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
// Player 0 and player 1 win the game, while players 2 and 3 do not win.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 10
// 	1 <= pick.length <= 100
// 	pick[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= xi <= n - 1 
// 	0 <= yi <= 10

// - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
//   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
//   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).
// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
//   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
//   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int winningPlayerCount(int n, int[][] pick) {
        // Create a 2D array to count the number of balls of each color picked by each player
        int[][] count = new int[n][11];

        // Count the number of balls of each color picked by each player
        for (int[] p : pick) {
            count[p[0]][p[1]]++;
        }

        int winningPlayers = 0;

        // Determine the number of winning players
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= 10; j++) {
                if (count[i][j] > i) {
                    winningPlayers++;
                    break; // No need to check further colors for this player
                }
            }
