// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-delayed-arrival-time/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a positive integer arrivalTime denoting the arrival time of a train in hours, and another positive integer delayedTime denoting the amount of delay in hours.
//
// Return the time when the train will arrive at the station.
//
// Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.
//
// Example:
// Input: arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5 
// Output: 20 
// Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= arrivaltime < 24
// 	1 <= delayedTime <= 24

// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
// - Chinese Remainder Theorem (number, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Used to find an integer that satisfies a system of multiple congruence relations, particularly when the moduli are pairwise coprime. It's essential for reconstructing numbers from their remainders.
//   • Idea: The Chinese Remainder Theorem finds a unique integer solution to a system of linear congruences, modulo the product of their pairwise coprime moduli. It iteratively combines congruences, often using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for modular inverses, with a complexity polynomial in the number of congruences.
//   • Invariants: The current combined solution satisfies all previously processed congruences.; The current combined modulus is the product of all previously processed pairwise coprime moduli.
//   • Tips: Ensure all moduli are pairwise coprime for a unique solution.; Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find modular inverses.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if moduli are pairwise coprime, leading to no unique solution or no solution.; Incorrectly calculating modular inverses, which is crucial for the algorithm.
// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (heap, interval, greedy, simulation)
//   • When to use: When needing to find an optimal schedule for a set of jobs, each with a deadline and duration, typically to maximize completed jobs or minimize total lateness. This approach often involves processing jobs based on deadlines and dynamically selecting tasks.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal job schedule by processing jobs sorted by their deadlines, using a priority queue to manage available tasks. It greedily selects jobs with the shortest run-time that can be completed within the current time window, achieving an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs with deadlines greater than the current job's deadline have been considered.; The priority queue contains jobs that can potentially be scheduled within the current time window.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by deadline in descending order to process later deadlines first.; Use a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve the job with the least run-time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly sorting jobs (e.g., ascending deadline or by duration).; Not handling overlapping time intervals or deadlines properly.
