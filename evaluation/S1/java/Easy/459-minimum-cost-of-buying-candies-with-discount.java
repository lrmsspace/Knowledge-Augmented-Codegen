// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-of-buying-candies-with-discount/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// A shop is selling candies at a discount. For every two candies sold, the shop gives a third candy for free.
//
// The customer can choose any candy to take away for free as long as the cost of the chosen candy is less than or equal to the minimum cost of the two candies bought.
//
//
// 	For example, if there are 4 candies with costs 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the customer buys candies with costs 2 and 3, they can take the candy with cost 1 for free, but not the candy with cost 4.
//
//
// Given a 0-indexed integer array cost, where cost[i] denotes the cost of the ith candy, return the minimum cost of buying all the candies.
//
// Example:
// Input: cost = [1,2,3]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.
// The total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the only way we can buy the candies.
// Note that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.
// The cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= cost.length <= 100
// 	1 <= cost[i] <= 100
//

// - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem can be solved by making the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping this leads to a globally optimal solution. This strategy is often simpler and faster than dynamic programming.
//   • Idea: The greedy algorithm makes the best choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum, without reconsidering previous choices. Its time complexity is typically O(N log N) or O(N).
//   • Invariants: At each step, the chosen element is the best available according to the greedy criterion.; The partial solution constructed so far remains optimal for the subproblem considered.
//   • Tips: Prove correctness by exchange argument or induction.; Sort input data if it helps identify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to prove the greedy choice property.; Making a locally optimal choice that prevents a global optimum.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine to minimize the total weighted completion time, where each job has a processing time and a linear penalty coefficient.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine with linear penalty functions by sorting jobs based on a specific ratio. It achieves an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The partial schedule constructed so far is optimal for the jobs included.; For any two adjacent jobs 'j' and 'k' in the final schedule, if 'j' precedes 'k', then 'c_j/t_j >= c_k/t_k'.
//   • Tips: Derive the sorting criterion using an exchange argument for adjacent jobs.; The optimal order is determined by the ratio of cost coefficient to processing time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the sorting criterion, especially the ratio order.; Overlooking edge cases like zero processing times or zero penalty coefficients.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

                totalCost += cost[i - 1];
            }
            // Skip cost[i - 2] as it's free
        }
