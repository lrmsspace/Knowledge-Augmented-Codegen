// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-asterisks/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are grouped into a pair. In other words, the 1st and 2nd '|' make a pair, the 3rd and 4th '|' make a pair, and so forth.
//
// Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'.
//
// Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|".
// The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
// Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
// There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 1000
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters, vertical bars '|', and asterisks '*'.
// 	s contains an even number of vertical bars '|'.

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: When needing to efficiently represent all substrings of a given string and perform various string operations like counting distinct substrings, finding occurrences, or checking for specific patterns. It provides a compact and powerful data structure for complex string problems.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal deterministic finite automaton that recognizes all suffixes of a given string. It compactly represents all substrings of the string, with each state corresponding to an endpos-equivalence class, and can be constructed in linear time O(N).
//   • Invariants: Every state corresponds to a unique endpos-equivalence class of substrings.; For any state, all substrings ending at its endpos set are represented by that state or its ancestors via suffix links.
//   • Tips: Focus on the endpos definition for state equivalence.; Understand the incremental construction process.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm is non-trivial and prone to off-by-one errors.; Misinterpreting the role of suffix links vs. transition links.
// - Finding repetitions (string, array, z-function, enumeration)
//   • When to use: This algorithm efficiently finds all repetitions (periodic substrings) within a given string by combining divide-and-conquer with the Z-function. It is particularly useful for identifying overlapping or crossing periodic patterns.
//   • Idea: The Main-Lorentz algorithm finds all repetitions in a string by recursively splitting it into halves and identifying 'crossing repetitions' using the Z-function. This approach achieves an optimal O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed `cntr` position, all identified crossing repetitions have a total length of $2 	imes (|u| - cntr)$.; The segment $u[cntr - k_1 	ext{ to } cntr - 1]$ is identical to $u[|u| - k_1 	ext{ to } |u| - 1]$.
//   • Tips: Employ divide-and-conquer to break the problem into subproblems for repetitions within halves and crossing repetitions.; Utilize the Z-function to compute $k_1$ and $k_2$ values in O(1) for each `cntr` position, speeding up crossing repetition detection.
//   • Pitfalls: Correctly identifying and defining 'crossing repetitions' is the most intricate part of the algorithm.; Careful implementation of the Z-function for both the original and reversed string segments is crucial.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int countAsterisks(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        boolean inBetweenBars = false;

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '|') {
                inBetweenBars = !inBetweenBars;
            } else if (c == '*' && !inBetweenBars) {
                count++;
            }
