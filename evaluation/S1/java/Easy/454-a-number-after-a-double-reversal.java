// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/a-number-after-a-double-reversal/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Reversing an integer means to reverse all its digits.
//
//
// 	For example, reversing 2021 gives 1202. Reversing 12300 gives 321 as the leading zeros are not retained.
//
//
// Given an integer num, reverse num to get reversed1, then reverse reversed1 to get reversed2. Return true if reversed2 equals num. Otherwise return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: num = 526
// Output: true
// Explanation: Reverse num to get 625, then reverse 625 to get 526, which equals num.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= num <= 106
//

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Josephus Problem (number, simulation, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the survivor's position in a circular game where every k-th person is eliminated, especially for large N where direct simulation is too slow.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the position of the last remaining person in the Josephus problem by iteratively reducing the problem size using a recursive formula and modulo arithmetic. It achieves an optimized time complexity of O(k log n).
//   • Invariants: The number of remaining elements decreases in each recursive step.; The relative order of the remaining elements is preserved throughout the process.
//   • Tips: Handle the base case where n < k separately to avoid infinite loops or incorrect calculations.; Use 0-indexing for simpler modulo arithmetic in the recursive formulas.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling index shifts after elements are removed can lead to wrong results.; Forgetting the base case n < k can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect behavior.
// - Extended Euclidean Algorithm (number, gcd, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find integer coefficients x and y that satisfy Bézout's identity (ax + by = gcd(a,b)). It is also essential for computing modular multiplicative inverses and solving linear Diophantine equations.
//   • Idea: The Extended Euclidean Algorithm computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers 'a' and 'b', and simultaneously finds integer coefficients 'x' and 'y' such that 'ax + by = gcd(a,b)'. It operates in O(log(min(a,b))) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: x * (initial a) + y * (initial b) = current_a_value; x_1 * (initial a) + y_1 * (initial b) = current_b_value
//   • Tips: Can be implemented using either a recursive or an iterative approach.; The algorithm correctly handles negative integer inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases in recursive implementations can lead to errors.; Potential for integer overflow if coefficients x or y become extremely large, though uncommon.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public boolean isSameAfterReversals(int num) {
        // A number remains the same after a double reversal if it is 0 or does not end with a zero.
        return num == 0 || num % 10 != 0;           
    }
