// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string array words and a binary array groups both of length n.
//
// A subsequence of words is alternating if for any two consecutive strings in the sequence, their corresponding elements at the same indices in groups are different (that is, there cannot be consecutive 0 or 1).
//
// Your task is to select the longest alternating subsequence from words.
//
// Return the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
//
// Note: The elements in words are distinct.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["e","a","b"], groups = [0,0,1]
//
// Output: ["e","b"]
//
// Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is ["e","b"] because groups[0] != groups[2]. Another subsequence that can be selected is ["a","b"] because groups[1] != groups[2]. It can be demonstrated that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == words.length == groups.length <= 100
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 10
// 	groups[i] is either 0 or 1.
// 	words consists of distinct strings.
// 	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Suffix Automaton (string, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently represent all substrings of a given string and perform various string operations like counting distinct substrings or pattern matching in linear time.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal finite automaton that accepts all suffixes of a given string. It implicitly represents all substrings and can be constructed in linear time, O(N) where N is the string length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the initial state spells a substring of the original string.; Each state represents a set of substrings that share the same end positions in the original string.
//   • Tips: Understand the concept of `endpos` sets and how they define states.; The number of states and transitions in a suffix automaton is linear with respect to string length.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm can be complex and prone to off-by-one errors or incorrect link updates.; Debugging state transitions and suffix links requires careful attention.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
