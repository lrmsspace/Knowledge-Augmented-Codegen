// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/points-that-intersect-with-cars/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array nums representing the coordinates of the cars parking on a number line. For any index i, nums[i] = [starti, endi] where starti is the starting point of the ith car and endi is the ending point of the ith car.
//
// Return the number of integer points on the line that are covered with any part of a car.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [[3,6],[1,5],[4,7]]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: All the points from 1 to 7 intersect at least one car, therefore the answer would be 7.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	nums[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= starti <= endi <= 100

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, interval, simulation, interval-scheduling)
//   • When to use: When determining if two line segments in 2D space cross, touch, or overlap, and to find the nature of their intersection (point, segment, or empty).
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect and calculates their intersection point or segment. It typically involves checking for orientation changes and handling special cases like collinearity, with an O(1) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The bounding boxes of the two segments must overlap for an intersection to be possible.; If segments are collinear, their intersection is either empty, a point, or a sub-segment.
//   • Tips: Use a bounding box check first for early exit optimization.; Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling parallel or perfectly collinear segments.; Floating point inaccuracies leading to false positives or negatives.
// - Convex Hull construction (geometry, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a plane. It is fundamental for various geometric algorithms and optimization problems.
//   • Idea: Convex hull construction identifies the subset of points that form the vertices of the smallest convex polygon containing all given points. Common algorithms achieve this in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sequence of points currently forming the hull maintains a convex property.; All points considered up to the current iteration are either part of the hull or lie within the polygon defined by the hull.
//   • Tips: Sort points by X-coordinate (and Y for ties) as a common preprocessing step.; Consider algorithms like Graham Scan or Monotone Chain for efficiency.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect orientation calculations.; Incorrectly handling collinear points can result in non-minimal hulls or errors.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

            int start = car.get(0);

                covered[point] = true;

        }

        // Count the number of covered points
        int count = 0;
