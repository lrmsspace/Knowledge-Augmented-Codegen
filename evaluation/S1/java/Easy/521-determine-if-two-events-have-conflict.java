// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-events-have-conflict/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that happened on the same day, event1 and event2, where:
//
//
// 	event1 = [startTime1, endTime1] and
// 	event2 = [startTime2, endTime2].
//
//
// Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of HH:MM.
//
// A conflict happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).
//
// Return true if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: event1 = ["01:15","02:00"], event2 = ["02:00","03:00"]
// Output: true
// Explanation: The two events intersect at time 2:00.
//
// Constraints:
// event1.length == event2.length == 2
// 	event1[i].length == event2[i].length == 5
// 	startTime1 <= endTime1
// 	startTime2 <= endTime2
// 	All the event times follow the HH:MM format.

// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, interval, simulation, interval-scheduling)
//   • When to use: When determining if two line segments in 2D space cross, touch, or overlap, and to find the nature of their intersection (point, segment, or empty).
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect and calculates their intersection point or segment. It typically involves checking for orientation changes and handling special cases like collinearity, with an O(1) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The bounding boxes of the two segments must overlap for an intersection to be possible.; If segments are collinear, their intersection is either empty, a point, or a sub-segment.
//   • Tips: Use a bounding box check first for early exit optimization.; Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling parallel or perfectly collinear segments.; Floating point inaccuracies leading to false positives or negatives.
// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public boolean haveConflict(String[] event1, String[] event2) {
        // Extract start and end times for both events
        String start1 = event1[0];
        String end1 = event1[1];
        String start2 = event2[0];
        String end2 = event2[1];

        // Check for overlap
        return !(end1.compareTo(start2) < 0 || end2.compareTo(start1) < 0);         
    }
