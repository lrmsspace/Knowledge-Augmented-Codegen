// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-pair-removal-to-sort-array-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array nums, you can perform the following operation any number of times:
//
//
// 	Select the adjacent pair with the minimum sum in nums. If multiple such pairs exist, choose the leftmost one.
// 	Replace the pair with their sum.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array non-decreasing.
//
// An array is said to be non-decreasing if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element (if it exists).
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	The pair (3,1) has the minimum sum of 4. After replacement, nums = [5,2,4].
// 	The pair (2,4) has the minimum sum of 6. After replacement, nums = [5,6].
//
//
// The array nums became non-decreasing in two operations.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 50
// 	-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to perform standard stack operations (push, pop) and also query the minimum element currently in the stack, all in constant time.
//   • Idea: Augments a standard stack by storing each element along with the minimum value encountered up to that point in the stack. This allows O(1) retrieval of the current minimum, while push and pop operations also remain O(1).
//   • Invariants: The top element's second component (minimum_so_far) always represents the minimum value currently in the entire stack.; For any element (value, min_so_far) in the stack, min_so_far is the minimum of 'value' and all elements below it.
//   • Tips: Store elements as pairs: (actual_value, minimum_at_this_level).; When pushing, the new minimum_at_this_level is min(new_value, stack.top().second) if stack is not empty, else new_value.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case when calculating the minimum for a new element.; Incorrectly assuming the minimum can be tracked with a single auxiliary variable without considering pops.
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
//   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
//   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: When tasks need to be processed sequentially on a single resource to optimize a cumulative metric like total completion time or weighted sum of completion times.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal sequence for processing jobs on a single machine by applying a greedy strategy, often involving sorting based on specific criteria. It typically achieves an optimal schedule in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The list of jobs is sorted according to the chosen greedy criterion.; For any prefix of the sorted jobs, the current schedule minimizes the objective function for those jobs.
//   • Tips: Identify the correct sorting key (e.g., processing time, weight/time ratio) for the objective function.; Prove optimality using an exchange argument to justify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying an incorrect sorting criterion for the specific optimization objective.; Assuming a greedy approach is always optimal without a formal proof.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
