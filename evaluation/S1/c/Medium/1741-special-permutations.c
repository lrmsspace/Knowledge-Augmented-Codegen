// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/special-permutations/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing n distinct positive integers. A permutation of nums is called special if:
//
//
// 	For all indexes 0 <= i < n - 1, either nums[i] % nums[i+1] == 0 or nums[i+1] % nums[i] == 0.
//
//
// Return the total number of special permutations. As the answer could be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,3,6]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: [3,6,2] and [2,6,3] are the two special permutations of nums.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 14
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109

// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
// - Binomial Coefficients (array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to compute many binomial coefficients, especially for values up to a certain N, or when working with modulo arithmetic where division is not straightforward.
//   • Idea: This method computes binomial coefficients using Pascal's identity, building a 2D DP table where C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k). It has a time complexity of O(N^2) for computing all coefficients up to N.
//   • Invariants: For each cell dp[i][j], it stores the value of C(i, j).; At the start of computing row i, all values for row i-1 are correctly calculated and available.
//   • Tips: Optimize space by storing only the current and previous row of the DP table.; For O(1) lookup after precomputation, calculate all factorials and inverse factorials modulo a prime.
//   • Pitfalls: Direct division for C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) is problematic with modulo arithmetic unless the modulo is prime.; Integer overflow can occur for large N and K if not handled with appropriate data types or modulo operations.
// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
