//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers arr of even length n and an integer k.
//
// We want to divide the array into exactly n / 2 pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by k.
//
// Return true If you can find a way to do that or false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,10,6,7,8,9], k = 5
// Output: true
// Explanation: Pairs are (1,9),(2,8),(3,7),(4,6) and (5,10).
//
// Constraints:
// arr.length == n
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	n is even.
// 	-109 <= arr[i] <= 109
// 	1 <= k <= 105

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Primality tests (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to determine if a single number is prime, especially for numbers where trial division up to its square root is computationally feasible.
//   • Idea: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This method checks for primality by attempting to find a non-trivial divisor up to the square root of the given number, running in O(sqrt(N)) time.
//   • Invariants: No integer k in the range [2, current_divisor - 1] has been found to divide n.; The current value current_divisor is a candidate divisor being tested against n.
//   • Tips: Only check numbers between 2 and sqrt(n).; Handle 2 as a special case before iterating.
//   • Pitfalls: O(sqrt(N)) complexity can be too slow for very large numbers.; Incorrectly handling edge cases like 0, 1, or 2.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Garner's algorithm
//  (number, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when reconstructing a large integer from a system of congruences with pairwise coprime moduli, offering an alternative to the direct Chinese Remainder Theorem approach.
//   • Idea: Garner's algorithm efficiently reconstructs an integer from its remainders modulo a set of pairwise coprime numbers, by computing its mixed radix representation coefficients. It typically runs in O(k^2 log M) time, where k is the number of moduli and M is the maximum modulus, assuming modular inverse takes log M time.
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration j, the partial sum $V_{j-1}$ satisfies $V_{j-1} \equiv a_i \pmod{p_i}$ for all $i < j$.; For each iteration j, the coefficient $x_j$ is uniquely determined in the range $[0, p_j - 1]$.
//   • Tips: Ensure all moduli are pairwise coprime for a unique solution.; Precompute modular inverses for efficiency, especially if many are needed.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating modular inverses, leading to wrong coefficients.; Not handling large intermediate products, which can cause integer overflow.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
