// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-points-with-distance-k/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array coordinates and an integer k, where coordinates[i] = [xi, yi] are the coordinates of the ith point in a 2D plane.
//
// We define the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as (x1 XOR x2) + (y1 XOR y2) where XOR is the bitwise XOR operation.
//
// Return the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and the distance between points i and j is equal to k.
//
// Example:
// Input: coordinates = [[1,2],[4,2],[1,3],[5,2]], k = 5
// Output: 2
// Explanation: We can choose the following pairs:
// - (0,1): Because we have (1 XOR 4) + (2 XOR 2) = 5.
// - (2,3): Because we have (1 XOR 5) + (3 XOR 2) = 5.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= coordinates.length <= 50000
// 	0 <= xi, yi <= 106
// 	0 <= k <= 100

// - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When all subsets of a fixed size K need to be generated, either in lexicographical order or such that successive combinations differ by exactly one element.
//   • Idea: This algorithm enumerates all K-combinations from a set, either in lexicographical order or using a Gray code approach where adjacent combinations differ by a single element. It typically runs in O(N choose K) time, generating each combination in O(K) or O(1) amortized time.
//   • Invariants: Each generated combination contains exactly K distinct elements.; All elements within a combination are unique and from the original set.
//   • Tips: For lexicographical generation, find the rightmost element that can be incremented without exceeding its maximum possible value.; After incrementing an element, set all subsequent elements to their minimum valid values.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions for the rightmost element or its maximum value.; Off-by-one errors when assigning subsequent elements after an increment.
// - Lattice points inside non-lattice polygon (geometry, number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to count integer coordinate points strictly inside a polygon whose vertices are not restricted to integer coordinates. It's suitable for problems requiring precise geometric counting with non-lattice boundaries.
//   • Idea: This algorithm counts lattice points within a polygon with arbitrary vertices by summing signed contributions from each edge. It reduces the problem to evaluating sums of floor functions, sum(floor(kx+b)), which is solved recursively, typically achieving logarithmic complexity per edge.
//   • Invariants: The sum sum(floor(kx+b)) correctly accumulates points below the current edge segment.; After coordinate transformations, the problem reduces to a sum over a non-negative range with non-negative k and b.
//   • Tips: Decompose the polygon into signed areas under each edge, similar to the shoelace formula.; Handle edge cases where k or b are negative by appropriate transformations.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues when calculating k and b or during transformations.; Incorrectly handling boundary points (points on edges or vertices).
// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, number, sparse-table, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries on a static array in O(1) time, after an initial O(N log N) preprocessing phase. It is particularly efficient for associative operations like sum, min, or max.
//   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes results for all possible range queries on a static array using a hierarchical block decomposition. It achieves O(N log N) construction time and space complexity, enabling O(1) query time for associative operations.
//   • Invariants: ST[k][i] stores the result for a range of length 2^k starting at i within its block.; For any level k, blocks are disjoint, but ranges within ST[k] can overlap with ranges in ST[k-1].
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values or highest set bit for efficient level determination.; Ensure the operation (e.g., sum, min, max) is associative for correct combination.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for arrays that require updates, as it's a static data structure.; Only works for associative operations; non-associative operations cannot be combined this way.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
