// Problem Description:
// Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
//
// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
// Output: 6
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
// 	-109 <= Node.val <= 109
// 	All Node.val are unique.
// 	p != q
// 	p and q will exist in the BST.

// - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, stack, simulation, monotonic-stack)
//   • When to use: This technique is used to answer Range Minimum Queries efficiently on a static array by transforming them into Lowest Common Ancestor queries on a Cartesian Tree.
//   • Idea: This approach solves Range Minimum Query problems by constructing a Cartesian Tree from the input array, where the root of any subtree is its minimum element. RMQ for a given range then reduces to finding the Lowest Common Ancestor of the range's endpoints in this tree, allowing O(N) construction and O(1) query time after O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian Tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the subtree rooted at `u`.; For any node `u`, all nodes in its left subtree have indices smaller than `index(u)`, and all nodes in its right subtree have indices larger than `index(u)`.
//   • Tips: A Cartesian Tree is a binary tree where each node's value is less than its children's values, and an in-order traversal yields the original array.; Utilize a monotonic stack to construct the Cartesian Tree in linear O(N) time.
//   • Pitfalls: Correctly implementing the monotonic stack for Cartesian Tree construction can be challenging.; Edge cases, such as an empty stack or handling the last elements during tree building, must be managed carefully.
// - Balanced Search Trees (tree, ds, recursion)
//   • When to use: When needing a self-balancing search tree that guarantees logarithmic time complexity for search and insertion operations. Useful for maintaining data in sorted order with consistent performance, especially when frequent updates are expected.
//   • Idea: A 2-3 tree is a self-balancing search tree where every node has either two children (a 2-node) or three children (a 3-node), ensuring all leaves are at the same depth. It guarantees O(log N) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
//   • Invariants: All leaves are at the same depth from the root.; Every node is either a 2-node (one key, two children) or a 3-node (two keys, three children).
//   • Tips: Understand the two node types: 2-nodes (one key, two children) and 3-nodes (two keys, three children).; Insertion always starts by finding the leaf position, then propagates splits upwards if a 4-node is formed.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the promotion of keys during node splits can break the tree's structure.; Forgetting to update parent links after a node split or merge operation.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Farach-Colton and Bender Algorithm (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: When frequent LCA queries are needed on a static tree, and optimal query time is critical. It's suitable for scenarios requiring O(1) query time after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a tree by reducing the problem to Range Minimum Query (RMQ) on an Euler tour. It preprocesses the tree in O(N) time using DFS to build an array of nodes and their depths, then answers LCA queries in O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour array contains every edge traversed twice, and each node appears at least once.; The depth array stores the correct distance from the root for each node's occurrence in the Euler tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a DFS to construct the Euler tour and depth array.; Store both the node identifier and its depth during the Euler tour.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the start and end indices for the RMQ on the Euler tour.; Off-by-one errors when mapping Euler tour indices to original nodes or depths.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
