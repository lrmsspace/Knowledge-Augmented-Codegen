// Problem Description:
// Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.
//
// The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).
//
// The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).
//
// Example:
// Input: ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2
// Output: 45
//
// Constraints:
// -104 <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 104
// 	-104 <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 104
// 	-104 <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 104
// 	-104 <= by1 <= by2 <= 104

// - Half-plane intersection (geometry, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the common region defined by a set of half-planes, or determine if such a region exists. It's particularly useful for checking if the intersection is empty.
//   • Idea: This method finds the intersection of N half-planes by checking all O(N^2) pairwise line intersections. Each intersection point is then verified against all N half-planes, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each candidate vertex is an intersection of two half-plane boundary lines.; Any point included in the final intersection region satisfies all given half-plane constraints.
//   • Tips: The vertices of the resulting convex polygon are always intersection points of the boundary lines.; Can be used to check if the intersection region is empty.
//   • Pitfalls: High time complexity of O(N^3) makes it inefficient for large N.; Numerical precision issues when calculating intersection points and checking containment.
// - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in order. It is efficient for both convex and non-convex polygons.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing signed trapezoidal areas formed by each edge and the x-axis, or equivalently, using the shoelace formula. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of vertices.
//   • Invariants: Vertices are processed sequentially in their given order, forming edges.; The running sum `current_sum` accumulates the signed contribution from each edge processed so far.
//   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in a consistent order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; Use a data type with sufficient range (e.g., long long or double) for intermediate sums to prevent overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect vertex order will result in an incorrect signed area or even zero.; Integer overflow can occur if coordinates are large and sums exceed standard integer limits.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
//   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
//   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
