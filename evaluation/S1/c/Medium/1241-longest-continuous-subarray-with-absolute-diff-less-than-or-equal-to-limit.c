// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
// Output: 2 
// Explanation: All subarrays are: 
// [8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
// [8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
// [8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
// [8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
// [2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
// [2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
// [2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
// [4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
// [4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
// [7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
// Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
// 	0 <= limit <= 109

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
// - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (queue, deque, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: Use this technique when you need to perform standard queue or stack operations while also querying the minimum (or maximum) element in O(1) time. It is ideal for problems involving sliding windows or dynamic collections where min/max queries are frequent.
//   • Idea: This technique augments a queue or stack with an auxiliary data structure, typically a deque, to maintain elements in monotonic order. This allows for O(1) retrieval of the minimum (or maximum) element, with standard operations achieving amortized O(1) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The auxiliary deque stores elements in non-decreasing order from front to back.; The element at the front of the auxiliary deque is the minimum of all elements currently in the main queue/stack.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque for the auxiliary structure to efficiently add and remove from both ends.; For a minimum queue, maintain the auxiliary deque in non-decreasing order from front to back.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling removals when the element to be removed from the main structure is not the current minimum.; Forgetting to remove elements from the auxiliary deque when they are no longer relevant (e.g., out of window bounds).
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
