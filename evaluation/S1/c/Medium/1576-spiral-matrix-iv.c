// Problem Description:
// You are given two integers m and n, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.
//
// You are also given the head of a linked list of integers.
//
// Generate an m x n matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in spiral order (clockwise), starting from the top-left of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with -1.
//
// Return the generated matrix.
//
// Example:
// Input: m = 3, n = 5, head = [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]
// Output: [[3,0,2,6,8],[5,0,-1,-1,1],[5,2,4,9,7]]
// Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed in the matrix.
// Note that the remaining spaces in the matrix are filled with -1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= m, n <= 105
// 	1 <= m * n <= 105
// 	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, m * n].
// 	0 <= Node.val <= 1000

// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
//   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
//   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Minkowski sum of convex polygons (geometry, array, two-pointers, sweep-line)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to compute the Minkowski sum of two convex polygons efficiently. It is ideal for applications requiring the union of shapes or collision detection between convex objects.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes the Minkowski sum of two convex polygons by merging their edge vectors, sorted by polar angle, into a new sequence of edges. The resulting sum polygon is also convex and can be constructed in O(|P| + |Q|) time.
//   • Invariants: The current vertex of the resulting sum polygon is the sum of the current vertices from P and Q.; All edges processed so far from both input polygons have been added to the output in polar angle order.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort polygon vertices to start from the lowest Y-coordinate to ensure consistent orientation.; Orient both input polygons counter-clockwise for correct edge vector generation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling polygon orientation (e.g., mixing clockwise and counter-clockwise).; Precision issues when using floating-point numbers for angle comparisons or vector additions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
