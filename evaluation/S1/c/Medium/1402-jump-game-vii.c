// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed binary string s and two integers minJump and maxJump. In the beginning, you are standing at index 0, which is equal to '0'. You can move from index i to index j if the following conditions are fulfilled:
//
//
// 	i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1), and
// 	s[j] == '0'.
//
//
// Return true if you can reach index s.length - 1 in s, or false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "011010", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
// Output: true
// Explanation:
// In the first step, move from index 0 to index 3. 
// In the second step, move from index 3 to index 5.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
// 	s[0] == '0'
// 	1 <= minJump <= maxJump < s.length

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is particularly efficient when optimizing the O(N^2) dynamic programming solution to O(N log N) using binary search.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the longest subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array always stores the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The 'tails' array is always sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array 'tails' where 'tails[i]' is the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.; Utilize binary search (e.g., `std::lower_bound`) to find the correct position for the current element in the 'tails' array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing a subsequence with a contiguous subarray, which is a common mistake.; Incorrectly updating the 'tails' array, leading to non-increasing subsequences or incorrect lengths.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Knuth's Optimization (array, interval, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When a range DP problem has a recurrence of the form dp(i, j) = min_k [dp(i, k) + dp(k+1, j) + C(i, j)] and the optimal splitting points satisfy opt(i, j-1) <= opt(i, j) <= opt(i+1, j).
//   • Idea: Knuth's Optimization is a technique to speed up certain dynamic programming problems on ranges from O(N^3) to O(N^2) time complexity. It applies when the optimal splitting point for a subproblem exhibits a monotonic property across adjacent subproblems.
//   • Invariants: dp[i][j] stores the minimum cost for the interval [i, j].; opt[i][j] stores the optimal split point k for interval [i, j].
//   • Tips: Verify the quadrangle inequality for the cost function C(i, j).; Ensure the optimal split points exhibit monotonicity: opt(i, j-1) <= opt(i, j) <= opt(i+1, j).
//   • Pitfalls: Applying the optimization without rigorously verifying the monotonicity condition.; Incorrectly calculating the cost function C(i, j) or its properties.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
