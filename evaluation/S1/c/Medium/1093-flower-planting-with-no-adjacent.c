// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/flower-planting-with-no-adjacent/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You have n gardens, labeled from 1 to n, and an array paths where paths[i] = [xi, yi] describes a bidirectional path between garden xi to garden yi. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.
//
// All gardens have at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.
//
// Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.
//
// Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)th garden. The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
// Output: [1,2,3]
// Explanation:
// Gardens 1 and 2 have different types.
// Gardens 2 and 3 have different types.
// Gardens 3 and 1 have different types.
// Hence, [1,2,3] is a valid answer. Other valid answers include [1,2,4], [1,4,2], and [3,2,1].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 104
// 	0 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104
// 	paths[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= xi, yi <= n
// 	xi != yi
// 	Every garden has at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

// - Minimum-cost flow - Successive shortest path algorithm (graph, array, number, greedy, dijkstra, bellman-ford)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a flow of a certain amount (or maximum possible flow) through a network while minimizing the total cost associated with sending flow along edges. It is suitable for problems involving resource allocation with varying costs.
//   • Idea: The successive shortest path algorithm finds a minimum-cost flow by repeatedly finding a shortest augmenting path in the residual graph and pushing flow along it. Its complexity depends on the shortest path algorithm used (Bellman-Ford for general costs, Dijkstra with potentials for non-negative residual costs).
//   • Invariants: At the start of each iteration, the current flow is a valid flow from source to sink.; The residual graph correctly represents remaining capacities and reverse edges for the current flow.
//   • Tips: Use potentials (reduced costs) with Dijkstra to efficiently handle non-negative edge costs in the residual graph.; Initialize potentials to zero and update them after each shortest path computation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating residual capacities or reverse edge costs can lead to wrong results.; Failing to use potentials with Dijkstra can lead to incorrect shortest paths in graphs with negative edges.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Finding the Eulerian path in O(M) (graph, enumeration, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem requires visiting every edge in a graph exactly once, either starting and ending at the same vertex (cycle) or at two different vertices (path).
//   • Idea: An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. An Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian path that starts and ends on the same vertex.
//   • Invariants: Every edge in the graph is considered exactly once for inclusion in the path.; The current path segment always forms a valid trail in the graph.
//   • Tips: Check vertex degrees to determine path/cycle existence before attempting to find it.; For an Eulerian path, start traversal from one of the two odd-degree vertices.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling multi-edges or self-loops can lead to errors in degree calculation or traversal.; Failing to check graph connectivity can result in incomplete paths or infinite loops.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
