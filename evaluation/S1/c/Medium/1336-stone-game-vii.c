// Problem Description:
// Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
//
// There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the sum of the remaining stones' values in the row. The winner is the one with the higher score when there are no stones left to remove.
//
// Bob found that he will always lose this game (poor Bob, he always loses), so he decided to minimize the score's difference. Alice's goal is to maximize the difference in the score.
//
// Given an array of integers stones where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone from the left, return the difference in Alice and Bob's score if they both play optimally.
//
// Example:
// Input: stones = [5,3,1,4,2]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: 
// - Alice removes 2 and gets 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 13 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 0, stones = [5,3,1,4].
// - Bob removes 5 and gets 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 points. Alice = 13, Bob = 8, stones = [3,1,4].
// - Alice removes 3 and gets 1 + 4 = 5 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 8, stones = [1,4].
// - Bob removes 1 and gets 4 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = [4].
// - Alice removes 4 and gets 0 points. Alice = 18, Bob = 12, stones = [].
// The score difference is 18 - 12 = 6.
//
// Constraints:
// n == stones.length
// 	2 <= n <= 1000
// 	1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem involves finding an optimal value for a contiguous range of elements, and solutions for larger ranges can be derived by merging optimal solutions of smaller sub-ranges.
//   • Idea: An extension of dynamic programming where subproblems are defined over contiguous intervals, solving for dp[i][j] by iterating through all possible split points k within [i, j]. This often results in O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i][j] represents the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; When computing dp[i][j], all subproblems dp[x][y] where y - x + 1 < j - i + 1 are already solved.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.; Incorrect iteration order, leading to uncomputed subproblems.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
