// Problem Description:
// A company is planning to interview 2n people. Given the array costs where costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti], the cost of flying the ith person to city a is aCosti, and the cost of flying the ith person to city b is bCosti.
//
// Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n people arrive in each city.
//
// Example:
// Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
// Output: 110
// Explanation: 
// The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
// The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
// The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
// The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.
//
// The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 * n == costs.length
// 	2 <= costs.length <= 100
// 	costs.length is even.
// 	1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000

// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
// - Minimum-cost flow - Successive shortest path algorithm (graph, array, greedy, dijkstra, bellman-ford)
//   • When to use: This algorithm finds a minimum-cost flow of a given amount from a source to a sink in a flow network. It is suitable when both flow capacity and edge costs are present.
//   • Idea: The successive shortest path algorithm iteratively finds augmenting paths with minimum cost in a residual graph, using shortest path algorithms like Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra with potentials, until the desired flow is achieved. Its complexity depends on the shortest path algorithm used and the number of augmentations.
//   • Invariants: The total flow pushed from source to sink never exceeds the sum of capacities of edges leaving the source.; For any edge (u, v) with flow f_uv, 0 <= f_uv <= capacity_uv.
//   • Tips: Use potentials with Dijkstra for non-negative edge costs in the residual graph.; Bellman-Ford is necessary if initial edge costs can be negative or if potentials are not used.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating potentials can lead to wrong shortest paths.; Forgetting to add reverse edges with negative costs in the residual graph.
// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
