// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, check whether it is possible to divide this array into sets of k consecutive numbers.
//
// Return true if it is possible. Otherwise, return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6], k = 4
// Output: true
// Explanation: Array can be divided into [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,5,6].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
//
//

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - String Sorts (array, string, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to sort a collection of strings lexicographically, especially when string lengths vary or are large, and the character set is limited.
//   • Idea: This algorithm sorts an array of strings lexicographically by recursively applying a counting sort-like distribution based on characters from most significant to least significant digit. It typically achieves O(N*L + R*L) time complexity, where N is the number of strings, L is the average string length, and R is the radix size.
//   • Invariants: All strings in the current `a[lo...hi]` sub-array share a common prefix of length `d`.; After the distribution pass for character `d`, `aux` contains strings from `a[lo...hi]` stably sorted by their `d`-th character.
//   • Tips: Use an auxiliary array for stable distribution during each pass to maintain relative order.; Implement a cutoff to insertion sort for small sub-arrays to improve performance due to lower overhead.
//   • Pitfalls: Can have high overhead for small N or short strings compared to comparison sorts.; Potentially memory intensive due to the auxiliary array and recursion stack depth proportional to max string length.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
