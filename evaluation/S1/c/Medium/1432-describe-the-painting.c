//
// Problem Description:
// There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a unique color. You are given a 2D integer array segments, where segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori] represents the half-closed segment [starti, endi) with colori as the color.
//
// The colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were mixed when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a set of mixed colors.
//
//
// 	For example, if colors 2, 4, and 6 are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is {2,4,6}.
//
//
// For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the sum of the elements in the set rather than the full set.
//
// You want to describe the painting with the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array painting where painting[j] = [leftj, rightj, mixj] describes a half-closed segment [leftj, rightj) with the mixed color sum of mixj.
//
//
// 	For example, the painting created with segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]] can be described by painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]] because:
//
// 	
// 		[1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from both the first and second segments.
// 		[4,7) is colored {7} from only the second segment.
// 	
// 	
//
//
// Return the 2D array painting describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are not painted). You may return the segments in any order.
//
// A half-closed segment [a, b) is the section of the number line between points a and b including point a and not including point b.
//
// Example:
// Input: segments = [[1,4,5],[4,7,7],[1,7,9]]
// Output: [[1,4,14],[4,7,16]]
// Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
// - [1,4) is colored {5,9} (with a sum of 14) from the first and third segments.
// - [4,7) is colored {7,9} (with a sum of 16) from the second and third segments.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= segments.length <= 2 * 104
// 	segments[i].length == 3
// 	1 <= starti < endi <= 105
// 	1 <= colori <= 109
// 	Each colori is distinct.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search for a pair of intersecting segments (tree, geometry, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently determine if any pair of line segments in a given set intersect. It is particularly effective for detecting geometric overlaps in a 2D plane.
//   • Idea: This algorithm processes segments by sweeping a vertical line across the plane, maintaining an ordered set of active segments to efficiently check for intersections with neighbors. It achieves an optimal time complexity of O(N log N).
//   • Invariants: The sweep line always moves from left to right, processing events in increasing x-coordinate order.; The set of active segments contains all segments currently intersected by the sweep line, ordered by their y-coordinate at the sweep line's current x-position.
//   • Tips: Process events at the same x-coordinate by adding segments before removing them to catch vertex intersections.; Use a balanced binary search tree (e.g., `std::set`) to maintain active segments, ordered by their y-coordinate.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect event ordering (e.g., removing before adding) can lead to missing intersections at shared endpoints.; Floating point precision issues can cause incorrect intersection detection or ordering of segments.
// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
//   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
