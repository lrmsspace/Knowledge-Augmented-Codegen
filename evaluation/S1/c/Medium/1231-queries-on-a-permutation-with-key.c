// Problem Description:
// Given the array queries of positive integers between 1 and m, you have to process all queries[i] (from i=0 to i=queries.length-1) according to the following rules:
//
//
// 	In the beginning, you have the permutation P=[1,2,3,...,m].
// 	For the current i, find the position of queries[i] in the permutation P (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation P. Notice that the position of queries[i] in P is the result for queries[i].
//
//
// Return an array containing the result for the given queries.
//
// Example:
// Input: queries = [3,1,2,1], m = 5
// Output: [2,1,2,1] 
// Explanation: The queries are processed as follow: 
// For i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is 2, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5]. 
// For i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5]. 
// For i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is 2, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5]. 
// For i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5]. 
// Therefore, the array containing the result is [2,1,2,1].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= m <= 10^3
// 	1 <= queries.length <= m
// 	1 <= queries[i] <= m

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to perform standard stack operations (push, pop) and also query the minimum element currently in the stack, all in constant time.
//   • Idea: Augments a standard stack by storing each element along with the minimum value encountered up to that point in the stack. This allows O(1) retrieval of the current minimum, while push and pop operations also remain O(1).
//   • Invariants: The top element's second component (minimum_so_far) always represents the minimum value currently in the entire stack.; For any element (value, min_so_far) in the stack, min_so_far is the minimum of 'value' and all elements below it.
//   • Tips: Store elements as pairs: (actual_value, minimum_at_this_level).; When pushing, the new minimum_at_this_level is min(new_value, stack.top().second) if stack is not empty, else new_value.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case when calculating the minimum for a new element.; Incorrectly assuming the minimum can be tracked with a single auxiliary variable without considering pops.
// - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when division operations are required in modular arithmetic, especially for combinatorics or probability problems under a modulus. It's crucial for precomputing inverses efficiently for a range of numbers.
//   • Idea: Calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number 'a' modulo 'm', which is an integer 'x' such that (a * x) % m == 1. When precomputing inverses for a range [1, N], a linear time O(N) dynamic programming approach can be used.
//   • Invariants: For all k in [1, i-1], inv[k] correctly stores k^(-1) % m.; inv[i] is computed using previously calculated inv[m % i].
//   • Tips: For prime modulus 'm', a^(m-2) % m (Fermat's Little Theorem) is efficient for a single inverse.; The Extended Euclidean Algorithm works for any 'm' if gcd(a, m) = 1.
//   • Pitfalls: A modular inverse only exists if gcd(a, m) == 1.; Fermat's Little Theorem is only applicable when the modulus 'm' is prime.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
