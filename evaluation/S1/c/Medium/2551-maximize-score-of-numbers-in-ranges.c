//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of integers start and an integer d, representing n intervals [start[i], start[i] + d].
//
// You are asked to choose n integers where the ith integer must belong to the ith interval. The score of the chosen integers is defined as the minimum absolute difference between any two integers that have been chosen.
//
// Return the maximum possible score of the chosen integers.
//
// Example:
// Input: start = [6,0,3], d = 2
//
// Output: 4
//
// Explanation:
//
// The maximum possible score can be obtained by choosing integers: 8, 0, and 4. The score of these chosen integers is min(|8 - 0|, |8 - 4|, |0 - 4|) which equals 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= start.length <= 105
// 	0 <= start[i] <= 109
// 	0 <= d <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When searching for a specific element in a sorted collection or finding an optimal value over a monotonic function within a defined range. It efficiently reduces the search space by half in each step.
//   • Idea: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or determines a value that satisfies a monotonic predicate. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The potential answer always lies within the current search interval `[low, high]`.; All elements strictly less than `low` have been determined not to be the answer.
//   • Tips: Ensure the search space exhibits a monotonic property.; Carefully define the `low` and `high` bounds for the search interval.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating `low` or `high` bounds leading to infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing or loop conditions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
