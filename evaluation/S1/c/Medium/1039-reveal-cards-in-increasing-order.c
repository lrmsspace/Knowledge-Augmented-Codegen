// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array deck. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the ith card is deck[i].
//
// You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.
//
// You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:
//
//
// 	Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
// 	If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
// 	If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
//
//
// Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.
//
// Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.
//
// Example:
// Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
// Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
// Explanation: 
// We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
// After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
// We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
// We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
// We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
// We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
// We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
// We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
// We reveal 17.
// Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= deck.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= deck[i] <= 106
// 	All the values of deck are unique.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
// - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (queue, stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query the minimum element of a stack or queue in O(1) average time. Also applicable for finding minimums in all fixed-length subarrays using a sliding window.
//   • Idea: This technique augments a stack or queue to support O(1) average time retrieval of its minimum element, typically by storing minimums alongside data or using auxiliary structures. It achieves amortized constant time for all operations.
//   • Invariants: For a minimum stack, the auxiliary minimum stack's top element is always the minimum of all elements currently in the main stack.; For a minimum queue implemented with two stacks, the output stack is only refilled from the input stack when the output stack becomes empty.
//   • Tips: For a minimum stack, use an auxiliary stack to store minimums encountered so far.; Only push to the auxiliary minimum stack if the new element is less than or equal to its current top.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to pop from the auxiliary minimum stack when the main stack's top is removed.; Incorrectly handling the transfer logic between the two stacks for a minimum queue.
// - Suffix Array (string, array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query properties of all suffixes or substrings of a given text, especially for pattern matching or finding repeated structures. It is particularly useful for problems requiring lexicographical ordering of all suffixes.
//   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing their starting indices. It enables efficient string operations like pattern searching and finding longest common prefixes, typically constructed in O(N log N) time.
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, suffixes are sorted correctly up to a certain length (e.g., 2^k).; All suffixes of the original string are represented by their starting indices in the array.
//   • Tips: Append a unique sentinel character (e.g., '$') smaller than any other character to the string.; Utilize the LCP array, often built alongside, for advanced string queries and optimizations.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive sorting of suffixes by string comparison leads to an inefficient O(N^2 log N) complexity.; High memory usage for very long strings due to storing all suffixes implicitly or explicitly.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
