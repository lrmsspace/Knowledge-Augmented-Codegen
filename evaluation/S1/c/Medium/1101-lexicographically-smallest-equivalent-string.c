// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-equivalent-string/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.
//
// We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.
//
//
// 	For example, if s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.
//
//
// Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:
//
//
// 	Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.
// 	Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.
// 	Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.
//
//
// For example, given the equivalency information from s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", "acd" and "aab" are equivalent strings of baseStr = "eed", and "aab" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.
//
// Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2.
//
// Example:
// Input: s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"
// Output: "makkek"
// Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
// The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
// So the answer is "makkek".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s1.length, s2.length, baseStr <= 1000
// 	s1.length == s2.length
// 	s1, s2, and baseStr consist of lowercase English letters.

// - Range Minimum Query (array, ds, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when range minimum queries are needed on an array where elements can be dynamically removed or merged, and Union-Find is employed to manage the active state or connectivity of indices.
//   • Idea: Union-Find can be adapted to assist in range minimum queries, particularly when elements are dynamically removed or merged. It helps maintain connectivity of active elements or segments, allowing efficient traversal to find the minimum among available items, often with near-constant amortized time per Union-Find operation.
//   • Invariants: The `find` operation correctly returns the canonical representative for any element `i`.; Each set in the Union-Find structure maintains a property (e.g., minimum value, next available index) relevant to its merged elements.
//   • Tips: Utilize path compression and union by rank/size for optimal Union-Find performance.; Store relevant properties (e.g., minimum value, next available index) within the representative of each set.
//   • Pitfalls: Union-Find alone does not directly provide range minimums; it typically manages connectivity or availability.; Naive iteration through active elements found by Union-Find can be too slow for large ranges.
// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
// - Suffix Automaton (string, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently represent all substrings of a given string and perform various string operations like counting distinct substrings or pattern matching in linear time.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal finite automaton that accepts all suffixes of a given string. It implicitly represents all substrings and can be constructed in linear time, O(N) where N is the string length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the initial state spells a substring of the original string.; Each state represents a set of substrings that share the same end positions in the original string.
//   • Tips: Understand the concept of `endpos` sets and how they define states.; The number of states and transitions in a suffix automaton is linear with respect to string length.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm can be complex and prone to off-by-one errors or incorrect link updates.; Debugging state transitions and suffix links requires careful attention.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
