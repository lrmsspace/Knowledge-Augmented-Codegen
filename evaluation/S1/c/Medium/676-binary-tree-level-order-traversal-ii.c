//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
// Output: [[15,7],[9,20],[3]]
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
// 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Breadth-first search (graph, queue, array, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or when exploring all reachable nodes level by level. It is also suitable for problems requiring traversal of all nodes at a specific distance from a source.
//   • Idea: Breadth-first search systematically explores a graph level by level, ensuring that all nodes at distance k are visited before any nodes at distance k+1. It finds the shortest path in terms of number of edges for unweighted graphs in O(V + E) time.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue have been discovered and marked, but their adjacent nodes have not yet been fully explored.; For any node v marked as visited, distTo[v] stores the shortest path length from the source s to v.
//   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit.; Mark nodes as visited to prevent cycles and redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops or incorrect paths.; Not handling disconnected graphs correctly.
// - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, stack, simulation, monotonic-stack)
//   • When to use: This technique is used to answer Range Minimum Queries efficiently on a static array by transforming them into Lowest Common Ancestor queries on a Cartesian Tree.
//   • Idea: This approach solves Range Minimum Query problems by constructing a Cartesian Tree from the input array, where the root of any subtree is its minimum element. RMQ for a given range then reduces to finding the Lowest Common Ancestor of the range's endpoints in this tree, allowing O(N) construction and O(1) query time after O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian Tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the subtree rooted at `u`.; For any node `u`, all nodes in its left subtree have indices smaller than `index(u)`, and all nodes in its right subtree have indices larger than `index(u)`.
//   • Tips: A Cartesian Tree is a binary tree where each node's value is less than its children's values, and an in-order traversal yields the original array.; Utilize a monotonic stack to construct the Cartesian Tree in linear O(N) time.
//   • Pitfalls: Correctly implementing the monotonic stack for Cartesian Tree construction can be challenging.; Edge cases, such as an empty stack or handling the last elements during tree building, must be managed carefully.
// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to store ordered data in a hierarchical structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change while maintaining sorted order.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node has a key, and all keys in the left subtree are less than the node's key, while all keys in the right subtree are greater. Basic operations like search, insertion, and deletion typically have an average time complexity of O(log N) but can degrade to O(N) in the worst case.
//   • Invariants: For every node N, if L is in N's left subtree, then L.key < N.key.; For every node N, if R is in N's right subtree, then R.key > N.key.
//   • Tips: Understand the recursive definition for traversal and operations.; Handle edge cases like empty tree, single node, or leaf nodes carefully.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can lead to O(N) worst-case performance for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can lead to data loss or incorrect structure.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
