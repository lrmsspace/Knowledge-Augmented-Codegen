// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls. Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered 0, 1, and 2.
//
// The square room has walls of length p and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance q from the 0th receptor.
//
// Given the two integers p and q, return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.
//
// The test cases are guaranteed so that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.
//
// Example:
// Input: p = 2, q = 1
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= q <= p <= 1000

// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
// - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
//   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
//   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).
// - Finding the equation of a line for a segment (number, geometry, gcd)
//   • When to use: Use this method when you need to represent a line segment's equation using integer coefficients, especially to avoid floating-point inaccuracies in geometric computations.
//   • Idea: This method derives the general form of a line equation (Ax + By + C = 0) from two points, ensuring integer coefficients if input coordinates are integers. It then normalizes these coefficients using GCD to achieve a unique representation, typically in O(log(max(|A|,|B|,|C|))) time due to GCD.
//   • Invariants: The calculated coefficients A, B, C always satisfy A*Px + B*Py + C = 0 for point P(Px, Py).; After GCD division, the absolute values of A, B, C are coprime (unless all are zero).
//   • Tips: Always compute A, B, C using the given formulas for P(Px, Py) and Q(Qx, Qy).; Use absolute values of A, B, C when calculating their greatest common divisor.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to normalize coefficients leads to non-unique representations for the same line.; Incorrectly handling signs during the final normalization step can result in inconsistent forms.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
