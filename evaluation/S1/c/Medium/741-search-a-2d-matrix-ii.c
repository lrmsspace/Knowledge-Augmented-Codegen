// Problem Description:
// Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
//
//
// 	Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
// 	Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
//
// Example:
// Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
// Output: true
//
// Constraints:
// m == matrix.length
// 	n == matrix[i].length
// 	1 <= n, m <= 300
// 	-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109
// 	All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
// 	All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
// 	-109 <= target <= 109

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Gauss method for solving system of linea (bitset, matrix, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the number of solutions (zero, one, or infinite) for a system of linear equations, or to find the unique solution if it exists. It is suitable for solving systems represented as an augmented matrix.
//   • Idea: Gaussian elimination systematically transforms an augmented matrix into row echelon form using elementary row operations to solve a system of linear equations. It determines the existence and values of solutions in O(N^3) time for an N x N system.
//   • Invariants: The submatrix formed by rows 0 to current_row - 1 is in row echelon form.; For the current column, all elements below the pivot in previous columns are zero.
//   • Tips: Use a small epsilon for floating-point comparisons to handle precision issues.; Implement partial pivoting to enhance numerical stability by selecting the largest absolute value.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to account for floating-point precision errors can lead to incorrect results.; Improper handling of free variables can misrepresent infinite solution sets.
// - Point location in O(logn) (geometry, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently determine which region (face or edge) of a planar subdivision a given query point lies within, especially for multiple online queries.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a planar subdivision to answer point location queries in logarithmic time. It typically involves building a specialized data structure, possibly persistent, to quickly identify the containing face or edge for any given point.
//   • Invariants: The search process always maintains the invariant that the query point is within the current candidate region.; After each step, the search space for the point's location is reduced by a constant factor.
//   • Tips: Use a suitable geometric data structure like a trapezoidal map or persistent segment tree.; Carefully handle points lying exactly on edges or vertices.
//   • Pitfalls: Degenerate cases (vertical edges, collinear points) require careful handling.; Floating-point precision errors can lead to incorrect classifications.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
