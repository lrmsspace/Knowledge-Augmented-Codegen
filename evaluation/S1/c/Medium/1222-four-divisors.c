// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array nums, return the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors. If there is no such integer in the array, return 0.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [21,4,7]
// Output: 32
// Explanation: 
// 21 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21
// 4 has 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4
// 7 has 2 divisors: 1, 7
// The answer is the sum of divisors of 21 only.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 104
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to efficiently calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer. It is applicable in number theory problems or combinatorial tasks involving factors.
//   • Idea: This method computes the number of divisors and sum of divisors of an integer n by first finding its prime factorization. The core idea leverages properties of multiplicative functions, with a typical complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for factorization.
//   • Invariants: During prime factorization, temp_n always holds the remaining unfactored part of the original number.; The current_prime_factor iterates through potential prime divisors in increasing order.
//   • Tips: First find the prime factorization n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak.; Number of divisors d(n) = (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the special case of n=1 (1 divisor, sum 1).; Incorrectly calculating powers or sums, especially for large exponents.
// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
