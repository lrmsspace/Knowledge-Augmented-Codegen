// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-moves-in-a-grid/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers.
//
// You can start at any cell in the first column of the matrix, and traverse the grid in the following way:
//
//
// 	From a cell (row, col), you can move to any of the cells: (row - 1, col + 1), (row, col + 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) such that the value of the cell you move to, should be strictly bigger than the value of the current cell.
//
//
// Return the maximum number of moves that you can perform.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[2,4,3,5],[5,4,9,3],[3,4,2,11],[10,9,13,15]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can start at the cell (0, 0) and make the following moves:
// - (0, 0) -> (0, 1).
// - (0, 1) -> (1, 2).
// - (1, 2) -> (2, 3).
// It can be shown that it is the maximum number of moves that can be made.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	2 <= m, n <= 1000
// 	4 <= m * n <= 105
// 	1 <= grid[i][j] <= 106

// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
//   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
//   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.
//

// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
