// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.
//
// A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
// |8 - 3| = 5
// |3 - 7| = 4
// |8 - 1| = 7
// |10 - 13| = 3
// Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5000].
// 	0 <= Node.val <= 105

// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
//   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
//   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.
// - Depth First Search (graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use to explore all reachable nodes, find paths, detect cycles, or perform topological sorting. It's also suitable for tree traversals and connected components.
//   • Idea: DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes on the current path from source to current node are marked as visiting.; All nodes already fully explored are marked as visited.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set/array to prevent infinite loops in cyclic graphs.; Recursion stack can lead to stack overflow for deep graphs; consider iterative DFS with an explicit stack.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow with deep recursion on large graphs.; Incorrectly handling visited states can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
