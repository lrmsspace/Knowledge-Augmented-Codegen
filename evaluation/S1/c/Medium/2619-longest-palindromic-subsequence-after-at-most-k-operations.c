// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence-after-at-most-k-operations/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s and an integer k.
//
// In one operation, you can replace the character at any position with the next or previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'a' is after 'z'). For example, replacing 'a' with the next letter results in 'b', and replacing 'a' with the previous letter results in 'z'. Similarly, replacing 'z' with the next letter results in 'a', and replacing 'z' with the previous letter results in 'y'.
//
// Return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of s that can be obtained after performing at most k operations.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "abced", k = 2
//
// Output: 3
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	Replace s[1] with the next letter, and s becomes "acced".
// 	Replace s[4] with the previous letter, and s becomes "accec".
//
//
// The subsequence "ccc" forms a palindrome of length 3, which is the maximum.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 200
// 	1 <= k <= 200
// 	s consists of only lowercase English letters.

// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring within a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity for this task.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all maximal palindromic substrings centered at each position in a string by leveraging symmetry and previously computed results. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: d_odd[i] stores the radius of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.; The (l, r) interval always defines the rightmost palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with delimiters to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Maintain the current rightmost boundary `r` of the largest palindrome found.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update the `(l, r)` boundaries after processing each center.; Incorrectly calculating mirror positions or handling boundary cases for `i > r`.
// - Knuth's Optimization (array, interval, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When a range DP problem has a recurrence of the form dp(i, j) = min_k [dp(i, k) + dp(k+1, j) + C(i, j)] and the optimal splitting points satisfy opt(i, j-1) <= opt(i, j) <= opt(i+1, j).
//   • Idea: Knuth's Optimization is a technique to speed up certain dynamic programming problems on ranges from O(N^3) to O(N^2) time complexity. It applies when the optimal splitting point for a subproblem exhibits a monotonic property across adjacent subproblems.
//   • Invariants: dp[i][j] stores the minimum cost for the interval [i, j].; opt[i][j] stores the optimal split point k for interval [i, j].
//   • Tips: Verify the quadrangle inequality for the cost function C(i, j).; Ensure the optimal split points exhibit monotonicity: opt(i, j-1) <= opt(i, j) <= opt(i+1, j).
//   • Pitfalls: Applying the optimization without rigorously verifying the monotonicity condition.; Incorrectly calculating the cost function C(i, j) or its properties.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently represent all distinct substrings of a string, or perform various string operations like counting unique substrings, finding occurrences, or string matching in an online fashion.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a powerful data structure that represents all distinct substrings of a given string in a compact form, typically as a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG). It can be constructed in linear time O(N) and space O(N) for a string of length N.
//   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end-positions in the original string.; For any state `v`, `len(v)` is the length of the longest string represented by `v`.
//   • Tips: Understand the properties of `len` (length of the longest string in a state) and `link` (suffix link to the longest proper suffix).; The construction is online, processing characters one by one from left to right.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `link` updates, especially when cloning states during construction.; Forgetting to update the `last` pointer after each character addition step.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
