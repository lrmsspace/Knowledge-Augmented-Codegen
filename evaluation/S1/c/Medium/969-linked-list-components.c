//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the head of a linked list containing unique integer values and an integer array nums that is a subset of the linked list values.
//
// Return the number of connected components in nums where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.
//
// Example:
// Input: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the linked list is n.
// 	1 <= n <= 104
// 	0 <= Node.val < n
// 	All the values Node.val are unique.
// 	1 <= nums.length <= n
// 	0 <= nums[i] < n
// 	All the values of nums are unique.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
//   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
//   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
// - Counting labeled graphs (number, recursion, counting, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When the problem requires enumerating distinct labeled graphs with specific properties, such as connectivity, on a given number of vertices. It is suitable for combinatorial counting problems involving graph structures.
//   • Idea: This technique determines the number of connected labeled graphs by subtracting the count of disconnected graphs from the total. It typically employs a recursive or dynamic programming approach, often involving combinatorial terms like binomial coefficients, with a polynomial time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The total number of labeled graphs $G_n$ for $n$ vertices is always $2^{n(n-1)/2}$.; For any $n$, the sum of connected and disconnected labeled graphs equals the total number of labeled graphs.
//   • Tips: Start with the total number of labeled graphs $G_n = 2^{n(n-1)/2}$.; Use complementary counting: total graphs minus disconnected graphs.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to divide by $n$ when converting from rooted to unrooted disconnected graphs.; Incorrectly handling base cases for recursive definitions or DP states.
// - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, bitset, sieve)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit N, or efficiently check primality for many numbers within that range. It is ideal for precomputing primes.
//   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer N by iteratively marking multiples of each prime. It achieves O(N log log N) time complexity and O(N) space.
//   • Invariants: For any number i less than the current prime p, is_prime[i] correctly reflects its primality.; All multiples of primes smaller than the current prime p have already been marked as composite.
//   • Tips: Optimize by starting marking multiples from p*p for each prime p.; Use a bitset for memory efficiency when N is large.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to explicitly handle 0 and 1 as non-prime.; Incorrectly marking multiples, e.g., starting from 2*p instead of p*p.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
