// Problem Description:
// Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.
//
// The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is 1.
//
// Example:
// Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
// Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
//
// Constraints:
// m == mat.length
// 	n == mat[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 104
// 	1 <= m * n <= 104
// 	mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
// 	There is at least one 0 in mat.
//

// - Multi source BFS (queue, graph, multi-source-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest distance from any of a given set of source nodes to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph or grid.
//   • Idea: Multi-source BFS explores a graph or grid by starting from multiple initial nodes simultaneously, finding the shortest path from any of these sources to all other reachable nodes. It operates in O(V + E) time for graphs or O(rows * cols) for grids.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same shortest distance level from any source.; When a node `u` is dequeued, `dist[u]` represents the finalized shortest distance from any source to `u`.
//   • Tips: Initialize distances for all sources to 0 and add them to the queue.; Use a `visited` array or set to prevent redundant processing of nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark initial sources as visited before adding to the queue.; Incorrectly initializing distances for non-source nodes (should be infinity or a large value).
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, matrix, matrix-exp, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count the number of paths of a specific length between all pairs of vertices in a graph, or to find reachability in a fixed number of steps.
//   • Idea: This algorithm leverages matrix exponentiation to find the number of paths of a fixed length `k` between all pairs of vertices in a graph. Each matrix multiplication step extends path lengths by one, resulting in an O(N^3 log K) time complexity for an N-vertex graph.
//   • Invariants: After `m` matrix multiplications, `C_m[i][j]` stores the number of paths of length `m` from `i` to `j`.; The initial adjacency matrix `G` remains constant throughout the exponentiation process.
//   • Tips: Represent the graph as an adjacency matrix where `G[i][j]` is the number of direct edges.; Matrix multiplication `C_k * G` yields `C_{k+1}` for path counts.
//   • Pitfalls: Standard matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to O(N^3 log K) overall time complexity.; Memory usage is O(N^2) for storing matrices, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
