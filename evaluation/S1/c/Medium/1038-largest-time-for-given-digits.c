// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-time-for-given-digits/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array arr of 4 digits, find the latest 24-hour time that can be made using each digit exactly once.
//
// 24-hour times are formatted as "HH:MM", where HH is between 00 and 23, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 24-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 23:59.
//
// Return the latest 24-hour time in "HH:MM" format. If no valid time can be made, return an empty string.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [1,2,3,4]
// Output: "23:41"
// Explanation: The valid 24-hour times are "12:34", "12:43", "13:24", "13:42", "14:23", "14:32", "21:34", "21:43", "23:14", and "23:41". Of these times, "23:41" is the latest.
//
// Constraints:
// arr.length == 4
// 	0 <= arr[i] <= 9
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring within a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity for this task.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all maximal palindromic substrings centered at each position in a string by leveraging symmetry and previously computed results. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: d_odd[i] stores the radius of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.; The (l, r) interval always defines the rightmost palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with delimiters to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Maintain the current rightmost boundary `r` of the largest palindrome found.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update the `(l, r)` boundaries after processing each center.; Incorrectly calculating mirror positions or handling boundary cases for `i > r`.
// - Backtracking Algorithm (graph, backtracking, recursion, dfs)
//   • When to use: Used when exploring multiple possibilities to find a solution incrementally, often involving undoing choices if they lead to a dead end.
//   • Idea: Backtracking is a problem-solving technique that incrementally builds a solution by trying options and undoing them upon reaching a dead end. It typically explores a search space in a depth-first manner, often resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The current partial solution is valid up to the current decision point.; All choices made to reach the current state can be systematically undone.
//   • Tips: Define clear base cases for recursive termination.; Identify decision points and available choices at each step.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to undo changes (backtrack) after exploring a path.; Incorrectly defining base cases, leading to infinite recursion or wrong results.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
