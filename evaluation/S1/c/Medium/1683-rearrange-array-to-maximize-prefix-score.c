// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-array-to-maximize-prefix-score/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. You can rearrange the elements of nums to any order (including the given order).
//
// Let prefix be the array containing the prefix sums of nums after rearranging it. In other words, prefix[i] is the sum of the elements from 0 to i in nums after rearranging it. The score of nums is the number of positive integers in the array prefix.
//
// Return the maximum score you can achieve.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,-1,0,1,-3,3,-3]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: We can rearrange the array into nums = [2,3,1,-1,-3,0,-3].
// prefix = [2,5,6,5,2,2,-1], so the score is 6.
// It can be shown that 6 is the maximum score we can obtain.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	-106 <= nums[i] <= 106
//

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
//   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
//   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
//   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
