// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-strings-by-frequency-of-the-smallest-character/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Let the function f(s) be the frequency of the lexicographically smallest character in a non-empty string s. For example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the lexicographically smallest character is 'c', which has a frequency of 2.
//
// You are given an array of strings words and another array of query strings queries. For each query queries[i], count the number of words in words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W) for each W in words.
//
// Return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
//
// Example:
// Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
// Output: [1]
// Explanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= queries.length <= 2000
// 	1 <= words.length <= 2000
// 	1 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10
// 	queries[i][j], words[i][j] consist of lowercase English letters.

// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It is ideal for scenarios requiring both fast query and update operations on an array.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is an array-based data structure that efficiently calculates prefix sums and updates individual elements in an array. It supports both point updates and prefix sum queries in O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each `T[i]` stores the sum of a specific range `[g(i), i]` from the original array.; The `sum(idx)` function correctly aggregates values from `A[0]` to `A[idx]`.
//   • Tips: Understand the bit manipulation (`i & -i`) for navigating parent/child relationships.; Consistently choose and apply either 0-based or 1-based indexing throughout the implementation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0-based versus 1-based indexing can lead to off-by-one errors.; Forgetting to initialize the tree or performing updates incorrectly will yield wrong results.
// - Suffix array (array, tree, string, suffix-array, tree-dp, lca)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to perform fast substring searches, pattern matching, or other string operations on a fixed text, especially when space efficiency is critical compared to suffix trees.
//   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing only their starting indices. It is often paired with an LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array to enable efficient string algorithms, typically achieving O(N log N) or O(N) construction and O(M + log N) or O(M) search complexity.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `A` stores indices such that `S[A[i]:]` is lexicographically smaller than `S[A[i+1]:]` for all valid `i`.; The `lcp[i]` value represents the length of the longest common prefix between `S[A[i-1]:]` and `S[A[i]:]`.
//   • Tips: Pair with an LCP array to significantly speed up pattern searching and other string queries.; Consider Enhanced Suffix Arrays (ESA) for improved space and time efficiency over suffix trees, especially for large datasets.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive pattern searching without LCP information can be O(M log N), which might be too slow for long patterns.; Construction can be complex to implement efficiently in linear time.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
