// Problem Description:
// Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.
//
// For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.
//
// Example:
// Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
// Output: 11
// Explanation: The triangle looks like:
//    2
//   3 4
//  6 5 7
// 4 1 8 3
// The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= triangle.length <= 200
// 	triangle[0].length == 1
// 	triangle[i].length == triangle[i - 1].length + 1
// 	-104 <= triangle[i][j] <= 104
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Could you do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle?

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, segment-tree, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence such that elements in the subsequence are in strictly increasing order, preserving their original relative order.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search or a segment tree.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or DP array) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index 'i', 'tails[i]' stores the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array where dp[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Binary search is used to find the correct position for the current element in the dp array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates for strictly increasing versus non-decreasing requirements.
// - Shortest Paths (array, graph, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: To find the path with the minimum total weight or cost between two vertices, or from a single source to all other reachable vertices, in an edge-weighted graph.
//   • Idea: Shortest path algorithms determine the path with the least cumulative weight between nodes in a graph. This often involves a dynamic programming approach, iteratively updating minimum distances to achieve an optimal O(V*E) or O(E log V) complexity.
//   • Invariants: distTo[v] always stores the minimum path length from the source to v discovered so far.; For any edge u -> v, if distTo[u] is final, then distTo[v] will eventually be min(distTo[v], distTo[u] + weight(u,v)).
//   • Tips: Initialize the source distance to 0 and all other distances to infinity.; Use a `distTo` array to store the current shortest distances from the source.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to detect or handle negative cycles, which can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.; Incorrectly initializing distances or edge relaxation logic.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and value, to maximize total value without exceeding a given capacity. It is applicable for resource allocation problems with discrete choices.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack Problem aims to choose items with maximum total value such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It is typically solved using dynamic programming, achieving a time complexity of O(nW) for n items and capacity W.
//   • Invariants: `dp[j]` (in 1D DP) represents the maximum value achievable with capacity `j` using items considered so far.; When processing item `i` and capacity `j` (decreasing `j`), `dp[j-weight_i]` holds the value from previous items for that reduced capacity.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP table with zeros for capacity 0 and unreachable states.; For 0-1 knapsack with 1D DP, iterate capacity `j` in decreasing order.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect iteration order for 1D DP in 0-1 knapsack (using increasing `j`).; Off-by-one errors in item indices or capacity calculations.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

int minimumTotal(int** triangle, int triangleSize, int* triangleColSize) {
    // Dynamic Programming approach
    // We will use a 1D array to store the minimum path sums for each position in the current row.
    int* dp = (int*)malloc(triangleSize * sizeof(int));

    // Initialize the top of the triangle
    dp[0] = triangle[0][0];

    // Iterate through each row of the triangle
    for (int i = 1; i < triangleSize; i++) {
        // Update the last element of the current row
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + triangle[i][i];

        // Update the middle elements of the current row in reverse order
        for (int j = i - 1; j > 0; j--) {
            dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] < dp[j] ? dp[j - 1] : dp[j]) + triangle[i][j];
        }

        dp[0] = dp[0] + triangle[i][0];
