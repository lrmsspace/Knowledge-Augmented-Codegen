// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-sort-a-binary-tree-by-level/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the root of a binary tree with unique values.
//
// In one operation, you can choose any two nodes at the same level and swap their values.
//
// Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the values at each level sorted in a strictly increasing order.
//
// The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,4,3,7,6,8,5,null,null,null,null,9,null,10]
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// - Swap 4 and 3. The 2nd level becomes [3,4].
// - Swap 7 and 5. The 3rd level becomes [5,6,8,7].
// - Swap 8 and 7. The 3rd level becomes [5,6,7,8].
// We used 3 operations so return 3.
// It can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].
// 	1 <= Node.val <= 105
// 	All the values of the tree are unique.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Breadth-first search (graph, array, bfs, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or traversing a graph level by level to explore all reachable nodes. It is also suitable for finding connected components or checking reachability.
//   • Idea: Breadth-first search explores a graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in terms of edges from a source node to all other reachable nodes. It typically runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or next level of traversal from the source.; All nodes already dequeued have been fully processed, and their unvisited neighbors have been enqueued.
//   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit in a FIFO manner.; Mark nodes as visited immediately upon adding them to the queue to prevent redundant processing and cycles.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs or incorrect path lengths.; Not handling disconnected components if the goal is to traverse the entire graph.
// - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, stack, simulation, monotonic-stack)
//   • When to use: This technique is used to answer Range Minimum Queries efficiently on a static array by transforming them into Lowest Common Ancestor queries on a Cartesian Tree.
//   • Idea: This approach solves Range Minimum Query problems by constructing a Cartesian Tree from the input array, where the root of any subtree is its minimum element. RMQ for a given range then reduces to finding the Lowest Common Ancestor of the range's endpoints in this tree, allowing O(N) construction and O(1) query time after O(N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian Tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the subtree rooted at `u`.; For any node `u`, all nodes in its left subtree have indices smaller than `index(u)`, and all nodes in its right subtree have indices larger than `index(u)`.
//   • Tips: A Cartesian Tree is a binary tree where each node's value is less than its children's values, and an in-order traversal yields the original array.; Utilize a monotonic stack to construct the Cartesian Tree in linear O(N) time.
//   • Pitfalls: Correctly implementing the monotonic stack for Cartesian Tree construction can be challenging.; Edge cases, such as an empty stack or handling the last elements during tree building, must be managed carefully.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when counting labeled trees or converting between a labeled tree and a unique sequence representation for combinatorial analysis. It provides a bijection for problems involving N labeled nodes.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence of length N-2 that represents a labeled tree with N nodes. It is constructed by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor, and can be reconstructed back into the tree.
//   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always contains N-2 elements for a tree with N nodes.; At each step of encoding, the removed node is a leaf with the smallest label among all current leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for efficient updates.; Use a min-priority queue to quickly find the smallest-labeled leaf.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating node degrees after removal.; Off-by-one errors when dealing with 0-indexed vs. 1-indexed labels.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
