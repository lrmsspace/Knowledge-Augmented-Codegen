// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.
//
// You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
// Output: [1,2,3,5]
// Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
// 	-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use Merge Sort when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or linked lists where random access is costly.
//   • Idea: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: Each sub-array passed to merge is sorted.; The merge operation combines two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array.
//   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to maintain stability.; Consider iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: High space complexity due to auxiliary arrays.; Overhead of recursion can be significant for small inputs.
// - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer, merge-sort, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this when finding the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance in a 2D plane. It efficiently handles large datasets by recursively dividing the problem and merging results.
//   • Idea: It finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively dividing the set, solving subproblems, and merging results in O(N log N) time. The merge step efficiently handles cross-boundary pairs within a narrow strip.
//   • Invariants: The minimum distance returned by a recursive call is the true minimum for its input subset.; All points in the left subproblem have x-coordinates less than or equal to the median x-coordinate.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort points by x-coordinate to enable efficient splitting.; Maintain a y-sorted list of points for efficient merging of the strip.
//   • Pitfalls: An inefficient merge step can degrade complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2).; Failing to correctly identify and process cross-boundary pairs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
