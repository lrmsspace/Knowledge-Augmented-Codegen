// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/all-possible-full-binary-trees/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer n, return a list of all possible full binary trees with n nodes. Each node of each tree in the answer must have Node.val == 0.
//
// Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree. You may return the final list of trees in any order.
//
// A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 7
// Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 20

// - Introduction to Dynamic Programming (array, tree, recursion, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, and a natural recursive solution is inefficient due to redundant computations. It's ideal for transforming exponential recursive solutions into polynomial time.
//   • Idea: Top-down dynamic programming, or memoization, optimizes recursive solutions by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This technique typically reduces time complexity from exponential to polynomial, often O(N) or O(N*M).
//   • Invariants: memo[state] contains the computed result for 'state' if memo[state] is not the sentinel value.; If memo[state] is the sentinel value, the result for 'state' has not yet been computed.
//   • Tips: Initialize the memoization table with a sentinel value (e.g., -1, null) to distinguish uncomputed states from valid zero/false results.; Use arrays for lookup tables when the state space is contiguous and small for optimal cache performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the memoization table, leading to incorrect results or infinite loops.; Incorrectly identifying or handling base cases in the recursive function.
// - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, recursion, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when an exhaustive list of all subsets of a specific size K from a set of N items is required. It's suitable for problems needing to explore every possible configuration of K elements.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique subsets of size K from a set of N distinct elements, commonly employing recursion or bit manipulation. The typical time complexity is O(N choose K * K) for construction or O(N choose K) if just iterating.
//   • Invariants: The current partial combination always contains unique elements.; The number of elements chosen so far does not exceed K.
//   • Tips: Employ backtracking or recursion for a straightforward implementation.; Utilize bitmasks for efficient representation and generation, especially for smaller N.
//   • Pitfalls: Accidentally generating duplicate combinations if elements are not handled uniquely.; Failing to correctly define base cases or termination conditions for recursive calls.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
//   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
//   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
