// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
//
// Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
//
// Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
//
// Notice that you may not slant the container.
//
// Example:
// Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
// Output: 49
// Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
//
// Constraints:
// n == height.length
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= height[i] <= 104

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Minkowski sum of convex polygons (geometry, array, two-pointers, sweep-line)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to compute the Minkowski sum of two convex polygons efficiently. It is ideal for applications requiring the union of shapes or collision detection between convex objects.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes the Minkowski sum of two convex polygons by merging their edge vectors, sorted by polar angle, into a new sequence of edges. The resulting sum polygon is also convex and can be constructed in O(|P| + |Q|) time.
//   • Invariants: The current vertex of the resulting sum polygon is the sum of the current vertices from P and Q.; All edges processed so far from both input polygons have been added to the output in polar angle order.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort polygon vertices to start from the lowest Y-coordinate to ensure consistent orientation.; Orient both input polygons counter-clockwise for correct edge vector generation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling polygon orientation (e.g., mixing clockwise and counter-clockwise).; Precision issues when using floating-point numbers for angle comparisons or vector additions.
// - Maximum flow - Push-relabel method improved (graph, array, greedy, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this for maximum flow problems on graphs where an optimized push-relabel approach is required. It improves performance by prioritizing vertices with the greatest height for push and relabel operations.
//   • Idea: This algorithm is an optimized variant of the push-relabel maximum flow method, which improves efficiency by always selecting the vertex with the greatest height that has excess flow. This specific vertex selection strategy leads to a better theoretical time complexity, typically O(V^2 * sqrt(E)) or O(V^3) depending on implementation details.
//   • Invariants: For any edge (u, v) in the residual graph, h(u) <= h(v) + 1.; The total excess flow in the network is always non-negative.
//   • Tips: Always select the active vertex with the highest current height.; Maintain a data structure (e.g., buckets or lists) to quickly find highest-height vertices.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly managing the list of highest-height vertices.; Failing to update residual capacities after a push operation.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
