// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array arr and a target value target, return the integer value such that when we change all the integers larger than value in the given array to be equal to value, the sum of the array gets as close as possible (in absolute difference) to target.
//
// In case of a tie, return the minimum such integer.
//
// Notice that the answer is not neccesarilly a number from arr.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [4,9,3], target = 10
// Output: 3
// Explanation: When using 3 arr converts to [3, 3, 3] which sums 9 and that's the optimal answer.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= arr.length <= 104
// 	1 <= arr[i], target <= 105

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - Simulated Annealing (array, number, randomized, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when seeking a near-optimal solution for complex optimization problems with many local optima, especially when exact solutions are computationally infeasible or too slow.
//   • Idea: Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic metaheuristic for global optimization, inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It explores the search space by accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time, aiming to escape local optima.
//   • Invariants: The `s_best` state always represents the lowest energy found across all iterations so far.; The temperature `T` is always non-negative and decreases monotonically with each iteration.
//   • Tips: Start with a sufficiently high initial temperature to allow broad exploration.; Choose a slow cooling schedule (decay rate) for better solution quality, at the cost of longer runtime.
//   • Pitfalls: Getting stuck in local minima if the cooling schedule is too fast.; Excessive runtime if the cooling schedule is too slow or initial temperature is too high.
// - Range Minimum Query (array, bitset, bit-fenwick)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently query the minimum value within a range and perform point updates on an array. It's suitable for scenarios requiring logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick tree (BIT) can be adapted to answer Range Minimum Queries and perform point updates in O(log N) time. It achieves this by storing prefix minimums in a tree-like structure, allowing efficient aggregation.
//   • Invariants: Each node `tree[i]` stores the minimum of a specific range `[i - (i & -i) + 1, i]`.; An update to `arr[idx]` correctly propagates the new minimum to all relevant `tree` nodes.
//   • Tips: Adapt standard BIT operations for minimums instead of sums.; Use `min(current_value, new_value)` for updates and queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Standard BIT operations are for sums; direct application for minimums is incorrect.; Querying a range `[L, R]` for minimum is not a simple `query(R) - query(L-1)`.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
