// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/the-k-th-lexicographical-string-of-all-happy-strings-of-length-n/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// A happy string is a string that:
//
//
// 	consists only of letters of the set ['a', 'b', 'c'].
// 	s[i] != s[i + 1] for all values of i from 1 to s.length - 1 (string is 1-indexed).
//
//
// For example, strings "abc", "ac", "b" and "abcbabcbcb" are all happy strings and strings "aa", "baa" and "ababbc" are not happy strings.
//
// Given two integers n and k, consider a list of all happy strings of length n sorted in lexicographical order.
//
// Return the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than k happy strings of length n.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 1, k = 3
// Output: "c"
// Explanation: The list ["a", "b", "c"] contains all happy strings of length 1. The third string is "c".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 10
// 	1 <= k <= 100
//

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
