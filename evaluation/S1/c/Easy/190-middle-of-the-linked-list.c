// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
//
// If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
//
// Example:
// Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
// Output: [3,4,5]
// Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
// 	1 <= Node.val <= 100
//

// - Floyd's Linked List Cycle Finding Algorithm (linked-list, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently detect if a linked list contains a cycle and, optionally, find the entry point of that cycle, using only constant extra space.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses two pointers, one moving faster than the other, to detect if a cycle exists in a linked list. If a cycle is found, it can then determine the cycle's starting node in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The slow and fast pointers are always valid nodes or null.; In the detection phase, the fast pointer always covers twice the distance of the slow pointer.
//   • Tips: Initialize both slow and fast pointers at the head of the list.; Move the slow pointer by one step and the fast pointer by two steps in each iteration.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check for null on 'fast' and 'fast.next' before dereferencing them.; Incorrectly assuming the list is non-empty or has at least two nodes.
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
//   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
//   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
// - Point location in O(logn) (geometry, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently determine which region (face or edge) of a planar subdivision a given query point lies within, especially for multiple online queries.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a planar subdivision to answer point location queries in logarithmic time. It typically involves building a specialized data structure, possibly persistent, to quickly identify the containing face or edge for any given point.
//   • Invariants: The search process always maintains the invariant that the query point is within the current candidate region.; After each step, the search space for the point's location is reduced by a constant factor.
//   • Tips: Use a suitable geometric data structure like a trapezoidal map or persistent segment tree.; Carefully handle points lying exactly on edges or vertices.
//   • Pitfalls: Degenerate cases (vertical edges, collinear points) require careful handling.; Floating-point precision errors can lead to incorrect classifications.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
