// Problem Description:
// Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
//
//
// Symbol       Value
// I             1
// V             5
// X             10
// L             50
// C             100
// D             500
// M             1000
//
// For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
//
// Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
//
//
// 	I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
// 	X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
// 	C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
//
//
// Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "III"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: III = 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 15
// 	s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
// 	It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently represent all distinct substrings of a string, or perform various string operations like counting unique substrings, finding occurrences, or string matching in an online fashion.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a powerful data structure that represents all distinct substrings of a given string in a compact form, typically as a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG). It can be constructed in linear time O(N) and space O(N) for a string of length N.
//   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end-positions in the original string.; For any state `v`, `len(v)` is the length of the longest string represented by `v`.
//   • Tips: Understand the properties of `len` (length of the longest string in a state) and `link` (suffix link to the longest proper suffix).; The construction is online, processing characters one by one from left to right.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `link` updates, especially when cloning states during construction.; Forgetting to update the `last` pointer after each character addition step.
// - Hash Tables (array, number, string, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently by transforming keys into array indices, managing potential collisions.
//   • Idea: Hash tables map keys to array indices using a hash function, enabling average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups by efficiently managing potential collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash function always produces an index within the valid array bounds [0, M-1].; For any two equal keys, their hash values remain identical.
//   • Tips: Design hash functions for uniform key distribution across the array.; Ensure hash functions are deterministic and efficient to compute.
//   • Pitfalls: Using a hash function that does not uniformly distribute keys, leading to many collisions.; Failing to implement a proper collision resolution strategy.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
