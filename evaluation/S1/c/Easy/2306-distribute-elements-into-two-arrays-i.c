// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-elements-into-two-arrays-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 1-indexed array of distinct integers nums of length n.
//
// You need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays arr1 and arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1. In the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith operation:
//
//
// 	If the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2, append nums[i] to arr1. Otherwise, append nums[i] to arr2.
//
//
// The array result is formed by concatenating the arrays arr1 and arr2. For example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6], then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6].
//
// Return the array result.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,1,3]
// Output: [2,3,1]
// Explanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [2] and arr2 = [1].
// In the 3rd operation, as the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2 (2 > 1), append nums[3] to arr1.
// After 3 operations, arr1 = [2,3] and arr2 = [1].
// Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [2,3,1].
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= n <= 50
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 100
// 	All elements in nums are distinct.

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, number, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the optimal sequence of jobs to minimize the total completion time (makespan) on two machines, with a fixed processing order (machine 1 then machine 2) for all jobs.
//   • Idea: This problem involves ordering N jobs, each with two processing times (one for each machine), to minimize the overall makespan. Johnson's rule provides an optimal greedy solution for this specific two-machine flow shop problem in O(N log N) or O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed so far maintain the optimal relative order determined by Johnson's rule.; The current makespan is the minimum possible for the jobs already scheduled.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs based on Johnson's rule criteria: jobs with min(a_i, b_i).; Prioritize jobs with shorter machine 1 times or longer machine 2 times for early scheduling.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying Johnson's rule to problems with more than two machines, where it is not optimal.; Incorrectly sorting jobs within the two partitioned sets.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
