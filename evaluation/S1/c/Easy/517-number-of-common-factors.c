// Problem Description:
// Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.
//
// An integer x is a common factor of a and b if x divides both a and b.
//
// Example:
// Input: a = 12, b = 6
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= a, b <= 1000

// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to efficiently calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer. It is applicable in number theory problems or combinatorial tasks involving factors.
//   • Idea: This method computes the number of divisors and sum of divisors of an integer n by first finding its prime factorization. The core idea leverages properties of multiplicative functions, with a typical complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for factorization.
//   • Invariants: During prime factorization, temp_n always holds the remaining unfactored part of the original number.; The current_prime_factor iterates through potential prime divisors in increasing order.
//   • Tips: First find the prime factorization n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak.; Number of divisors d(n) = (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the special case of n=1 (1 divisor, sum 1).; Incorrectly calculating powers or sums, especially for large exponents.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all integer solutions (x, y) for a linear equation of the form ax + by = c, or to determine if such solutions exist. It is also applicable for enumerating solutions within specified bounds.
//   • Idea: This method finds all integer solutions (x, y) to the linear equation ax + by = c. It utilizes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution, then generates the general solution set using properties of the greatest common divisor in O(log(min(a,b))) time.
//   • Invariants: The equation a * x + b * y = c holds true for any generated integer solution (x, y).; For integer solutions to exist, c must be perfectly divisible by gcd(a, b).
//   • Tips: Always check if c is divisible by gcd(a, b); if not, no integer solutions exist.; Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution (x0, y0) for ax + by = gcd(a, b).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to verify that c is a multiple of gcd(a, b) before proceeding.; Incorrectly scaling the particular solution obtained from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
