// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.
//
// For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.
//
// Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.
//
// Example:
// Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
// Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
// Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.
//
// Constraints:
// n == names.length == heights.length
// 	1 <= n <= 103
// 	1 <= names[i].length <= 20
// 	1 <= heights[i] <= 105
// 	names[i] consists of lower and upper case English letters.
// 	All the values of heights are distinct.

// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or external sorting where data might not fit in memory.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and requires O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: The elements `index[lo...k-1]` are sorted and contain the smallest `k-lo` elements from the original `aux[lo...mid]` and `aux[mid+1...hi]` segments.; Pointer `i` always indicates the next element to consider from the left sorted sub-array (`aux[lo...mid]`).
//   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to ensure stability.; Consider an iterative bottom-up approach to avoid recursion overhead.
//   • Pitfalls: High auxiliary space complexity (O(N)) can be a concern for memory-constrained systems.; Recursive calls can lead to stack overflow for very large inputs without tail call optimization.
// - Suffix Array (string, array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query properties of all suffixes or substrings of a given text, especially for pattern matching or finding repeated structures. It is particularly useful for problems requiring lexicographical ordering of all suffixes.
//   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing their starting indices. It enables efficient string operations like pattern searching and finding longest common prefixes, typically constructed in O(N log N) time.
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, suffixes are sorted correctly up to a certain length (e.g., 2^k).; All suffixes of the original string are represented by their starting indices in the array.
//   • Tips: Append a unique sentinel character (e.g., '$') smaller than any other character to the string.; Utilize the LCP array, often built alongside, for advanced string queries and optimizations.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive sorting of suffixes by string comparison leads to an inefficient O(N^2 log N) complexity.; High memory usage for very long strings due to storing all suffixes implicitly or explicitly.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
//   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
//   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
