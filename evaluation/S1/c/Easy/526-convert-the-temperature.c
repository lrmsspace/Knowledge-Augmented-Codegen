// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-the-temperature/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a non-negative floating point number rounded to two decimal places celsius, that denotes the temperature in Celsius.
//
// You should convert Celsius into Kelvin and Fahrenheit and return it as an array ans = [kelvin, fahrenheit].
//
// Return the array ans. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
//
// Note that:
//
//
// 	Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15
// 	Fahrenheit = Celsius * 1.80 + 32.00
//
// Example:
// Input: celsius = 36.50
// Output: [309.65000,97.70000]
// Explanation: Temperature at 36.50 Celsius converted in Kelvin is 309.65 and converted in Fahrenheit is 97.70.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= celsius <= 1000

// - Simulated Annealing (array, number, randomized, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when seeking a near-optimal solution for complex optimization problems with many local optima, especially when exact solutions are computationally infeasible or too slow.
//   • Idea: Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic metaheuristic for global optimization, inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It explores the search space by accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time, aiming to escape local optima.
//   • Invariants: The `s_best` state always represents the lowest energy found across all iterations so far.; The temperature `T` is always non-negative and decreases monotonically with each iteration.
//   • Tips: Start with a sufficiently high initial temperature to allow broad exploration.; Choose a slow cooling schedule (decay rate) for better solution quality, at the cost of longer runtime.
//   • Pitfalls: Getting stuck in local minima if the cooling schedule is too fast.; Excessive runtime if the cooling schedule is too slow or initial temperature is too high.
// - Primality tests (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to determine if a single number is prime, especially for numbers where trial division up to its square root is computationally feasible.
//   • Idea: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This method checks for primality by attempting to find a non-trivial divisor up to the square root of the given number, running in O(sqrt(N)) time.
//   • Invariants: No integer k in the range [2, current_divisor - 1] has been found to divide n.; The current value current_divisor is a candidate divisor being tested against n.
//   • Tips: Only check numbers between 2 and sqrt(n).; Handle 2 as a special case before iterating.
//   • Pitfalls: O(sqrt(N)) complexity can be too slow for very large numbers.; Incorrectly handling edge cases like 0, 1, or 2.
// - bucket-sort (array, linked-list, bucket-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting elements, especially floating-point numbers, that are uniformly distributed over a range. It offers linear time complexity on average for such distributions.
//   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually using another sorting algorithm, and then concatenates the sorted buckets. It achieves an average time complexity of O(N+K), where N is the number of elements and K is the number of buckets.
//   • Invariants: Before sorting any bucket, all elements are correctly placed in their respective buckets based on their range.; After sorting each individual bucket, all elements within that bucket are in sorted order.
//   • Tips: Use a stable sorting algorithm like Insertion Sort for individual buckets to maintain overall stability.; The number of buckets should be chosen carefully, often proportional to N, to optimize performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degrades significantly with non-uniform data distributions, potentially becoming O(N^2).; Requires extra space for the buckets, which can be substantial for many buckets or large elements.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
