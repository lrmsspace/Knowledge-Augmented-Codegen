//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an n x n grid where you have placed some 1 x 1 x 1 cubes. Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of cell (i, j).
//
// After placing these cubes, you have decided to glue any directly adjacent cubes to each other, forming several irregular 3D shapes.
//
// Return the total surface area of the resulting shapes.
//
// Note: The bottom face of each shape counts toward its surface area.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
// Output: 34
//
// Constraints:
// n == grid.length == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= n <= 50
// 	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50

// - Convex Hull construction (geometry, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a plane. It is fundamental for various geometric algorithms and optimization problems.
//   • Idea: Convex hull construction identifies the subset of points that form the vertices of the smallest convex polygon containing all given points. Common algorithms achieve this in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sequence of points currently forming the hull maintains a convex property.; All points considered up to the current iteration are either part of the hull or lie within the polygon defined by the hull.
//   • Tips: Sort points by X-coordinate (and Y for ties) as a common preprocessing step.; Consider algorithms like Graham Scan or Monotone Chain for efficiency.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect orientation calculations.; Incorrectly handling collinear points can result in non-minimal hulls or errors.
// - Calculating the determinant of a matrix by Gauss (matrix, number, simulation, counting)
//   • When to use: When needing to compute the determinant of a square matrix, especially when Gaussian elimination is a familiar or efficient approach. It is suitable for matrices where direct cofactor expansion is computationally too expensive.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes the determinant of a square matrix by transforming it into an upper triangular form using Gaussian elimination. The determinant is the product of diagonal elements, adjusted by a sign factor from row swaps, with O(N^3) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Before processing column 'k', all elements A[i][j] where i > j and j < k are zero.; The determinant of the current matrix, multiplied by (-1)^swaps, equals the original matrix's determinant.
//   • Tips: Track the number of row swaps to correctly determine the determinant's sign.; Pivot selection can improve numerical stability, especially with floating-point numbers.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to adjust the sign after row exchanges.; Division by zero if a pivot element is zero, requiring a row swap.
// - Lattice points inside non-lattice polygon (geometry, number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to count integer coordinate points strictly inside a polygon whose vertices are not restricted to integer coordinates. It's suitable for problems requiring precise geometric counting with non-lattice boundaries.
//   • Idea: This algorithm counts lattice points within a polygon with arbitrary vertices by summing signed contributions from each edge. It reduces the problem to evaluating sums of floor functions, sum(floor(kx+b)), which is solved recursively, typically achieving logarithmic complexity per edge.
//   • Invariants: The sum sum(floor(kx+b)) correctly accumulates points below the current edge segment.; After coordinate transformations, the problem reduces to a sum over a non-negative range with non-negative k and b.
//   • Tips: Decompose the polygon into signed areas under each edge, similar to the shoelace formula.; Handle edge cases where k or b are negative by appropriate transformations.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues when calculating k and b or during transformations.; Incorrectly handling boundary points (points on edges or vertices).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
