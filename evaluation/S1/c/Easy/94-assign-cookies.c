// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
//
// Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
//
// Example:
// Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
// And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
// You need to output 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104
// 	0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
// 	1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1
//
//

// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
// - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer, merge-sort, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this when finding the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance in a 2D plane. It efficiently handles large datasets by recursively dividing the problem and merging results.
//   • Idea: It finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively dividing the set, solving subproblems, and merging results in O(N log N) time. The merge step efficiently handles cross-boundary pairs within a narrow strip.
//   • Invariants: The minimum distance returned by a recursive call is the true minimum for its input subset.; All points in the left subproblem have x-coordinates less than or equal to the median x-coordinate.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort points by x-coordinate to enable efficient splitting.; Maintain a y-sorted list of points for efficient merging of the strip.
//   • Pitfalls: An inefficient merge step can degrade complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2).; Failing to correctly identify and process cross-boundary pairs.
// - Hungarian algorithm for solving the assignment problem (matrix, graph, array, greedy, bfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when finding a minimum cost perfect matching in a bipartite graph, typically represented as an N x N cost matrix, where each row must be assigned to exactly one column.
//   • Idea: The Hungarian algorithm finds a minimum weight perfect matching in a bipartite graph, solving the assignment problem for an N x N cost matrix. It iteratively finds augmenting paths in an equality graph and adjusts potentials, achieving O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For all i, j, u[i] + v[j] <= A[i][j] (potential condition).; The current matching is always valid (each row/column used at most once).
//   • Tips: Understand the concept of potentials and their role in maintaining the equality graph.; The algorithm can be adapted for maximum profit problems by negating costs.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating potentials can lead to non-optimal solutions or infinite loops.; Handling non-square matrices requires careful padding with dummy values.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
