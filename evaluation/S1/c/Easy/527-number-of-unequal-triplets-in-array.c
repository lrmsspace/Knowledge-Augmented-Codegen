// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-unequal-triplets-in-array/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums. Find the number of triplets (i, j, k) that meet the following conditions:
//
//
// 	0 <= i < j < k < nums.length
// 	nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k] are pairwise distinct.
// 	
// 		In other words, nums[i] != nums[j], nums[i] != nums[k], and nums[j] != nums[k].
// 	
// 	
//
//
// Return the number of triplets that meet the conditions.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [4,4,2,4,3]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The following triplets meet the conditions:
// - (0, 2, 4) because 4 != 2 != 3
// - (1, 2, 4) because 4 != 2 != 3
// - (2, 3, 4) because 2 != 4 != 3
// Since there are 3 triplets, we return 3.
// Note that (2, 0, 4) is not a valid triplet because 2 > 0.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
//

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (matrix, array, dp-2d, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count elements satisfying "at least one" of several properties, especially when direct counting is complicated by overlapping sets. It's also applicable for counting elements satisfying "none" of the properties by subtracting from the total.
//   • Idea: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle is a combinatorial method to determine the size of the union of multiple finite sets. It works by summing the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all pairwise intersections, adding back the sizes of all three-way intersections, and so on, with alternating signs.
//   • Invariants: The count for any element satisfying `k` properties is adjusted to be exactly 1 in the final sum.; Each term in the sum corresponds to the size of an intersection of a distinct subset of properties.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the universe and the properties (sets) you are interested in.; Systematically list all combinations of properties for intersection terms.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying or defining the properties or sets.; Missing certain intersection terms or double-counting them.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
