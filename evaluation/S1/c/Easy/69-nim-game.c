// Problem Description:
// You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:
//
//
// 	Initially, there is a heap of stones on the table.
// 	You and your friend will alternate taking turns, and you go first.
// 	On each turn, the person whose turn it is will remove 1 to 3 stones from the heap.
// 	The one who removes the last stone is the winner.
//
//
// Given n, the number of stones in the heap, return true if you can win the game assuming both you and your friend play optimally, otherwise return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4
// Output: false
// Explanation: These are the possible outcomes:
// 1. You remove 1 stone. Your friend removes 3 stones, including the last stone. Your friend wins.
// 2. You remove 2 stones. Your friend removes 2 stones, including the last stone. Your friend wins.
// 3. You remove 3 stones. Your friend removes the last stone. Your friend wins.
// In all outcomes, your friend wins.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 231 - 1

// - Sprague-Grundy theorem. Nim (array, number, game-theory, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when analyzing impartial games with perfect information and no draws, especially to determine winning/losing states or to find a winning strategy. It's particularly useful for games that can be reduced to Nim.
//   • Idea: The Sprague-Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a Nim pile of a certain size (its nim-value or grundy number). For Nim, a position is a winning position if and only if the XOR sum of all pile sizes is non-zero, allowing for O(N) classification.
//   • Invariants: The XOR sum of the pile sizes (nim-sum) represents the game's current nim-value.; If the nim-sum is zero, any valid move will result in a non-zero nim-sum for the opponent.
//   • Tips: Understand the definition of impartial games and their properties.; Calculate the XOR sum of game components to determine the nim-sum.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing impartial games with partisan games where players have different moves.; Incorrectly calculating the XOR sum, leading to wrong state classifications.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: When tasks need to be processed sequentially on a single resource to optimize a cumulative metric like total completion time or weighted sum of completion times.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal sequence for processing jobs on a single machine by applying a greedy strategy, often involving sorting based on specific criteria. It typically achieves an optimal schedule in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The list of jobs is sorted according to the chosen greedy criterion.; For any prefix of the sorted jobs, the current schedule minimizes the objective function for those jobs.
//   • Tips: Identify the correct sorting key (e.g., processing time, weight/time ratio) for the objective function.; Prove optimality using an exchange argument to justify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying an incorrect sorting criterion for the specific optimization objective.; Assuming a greedy approach is always optimal without a formal proof.
// - Josephus Problem (number, recursion, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when simulating a circular elimination process with a fixed step size, especially when seeking the survivor's position. It's particularly efficient for specific step sizes like two.
//   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the last remaining position in a circular arrangement after elements are eliminated at fixed intervals. The recursive solution for a step size of two has a logarithmic time complexity, O(log N), due to its divide-and-conquer nature.
//   • Invariants: The number of participants N is always positive in each recursive subproblem.; The returned position is always within the valid range [0, current N-1] (or [1, current N]).
//   • Tips: Base cases are crucial for recursive solutions, typically for N=1.; Observe patterns for specific step sizes, especially k=2, which has a simpler formula.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when converting between 0-indexed and 1-indexed results.; Incorrectly applying the position 'shift' after elements are eliminated in subproblems.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
