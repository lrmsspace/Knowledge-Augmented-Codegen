// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-with-exactly-k-elements/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. Your task is to perform the following operation exactly k times in order to maximize your score:
//
//
// 	Select an element m from nums.
// 	Remove the selected element m from the array.
// 	Add a new element with a value of m + 1 to the array.
// 	Increase your score by m.
//
//
// Return the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation exactly k times.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
// Output: 18
// Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.
// For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]
// For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]
// For the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]
// So, we will return 18.
// It can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 100
// 	1 <= k <= 100
//

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

int maximizeSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int k) {
    int max = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < numsSize; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > max) {
            max = nums[i];
        }
    }

    // The maximum sum is obtained by selecting the maximum element k times,
    // incrementing it by 1 each time.
    // This forms an arithmetic series: max + (max + 1) + ... + (max + k - 1)
    // The sum of this series can be calculated using the formula:
    // Sum = k/2 * (first_term + last_term)
    // where first_term = max and last_term = max + k - 1

    int last_term = max + k - 1;
    int sum = k * (max + last_term) / 2;

    return sum;
