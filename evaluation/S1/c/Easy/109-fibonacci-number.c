//
// Problem Description:
// The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
//
//
// F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
// F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
//
//
// Given n, calculate F(n).
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 2
// Output: 1
// Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= n <= 30

// - Fibonacci Numbers (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use this when calculating the n-th Fibonacci number or similar sequences where each term depends on a fixed number of preceding terms. It efficiently avoids redundant computations for moderate 'n' values.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates Fibonacci numbers iteratively by storing previously computed values in an array, building up to the desired n-th term. This approach achieves O(N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] correctly stores the i-th Fibonacci number.; For i >= 2, dp[i] is computed as the sum of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2].
//   • Tips: Initialize base cases (F0, F1) correctly to start the sequence.; Use an array or two variables to store only the necessary previous terms.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the base cases can lead to wrong results.; A naive recursive solution without memoization will lead to exponential time complexity.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
//   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
//   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
