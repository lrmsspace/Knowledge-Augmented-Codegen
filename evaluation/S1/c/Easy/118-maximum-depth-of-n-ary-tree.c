// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.
//
// The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
//
// Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
// Output: 3
//
// Constraints:
// The total number of nodes is in the range [0, 104].
// 	The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Checking a graph for acyclicity and finding a cycle in O(M) (graph, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine if a graph contains any cycles or to identify one such cycle. It is applicable to both directed and undirected graphs.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses Depth First Search to detect cycles in a graph by tracking visited states of nodes during traversal. It runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently on the DFS recursion stack are marked as 'gray' (or equivalent).; All nodes fully explored and not part of the current path are marked as 'black' (or equivalent).
//   • Tips: For directed graphs, use a three-color scheme (white, gray, black) to distinguish states.; For undirected graphs, a simple visited array and checking against the immediate parent is sufficient.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the parent edge in undirected graphs can lead to false cycle detections.; Failing to distinguish between nodes currently in the recursion stack (gray) and fully processed nodes (black) in directed graphs.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
