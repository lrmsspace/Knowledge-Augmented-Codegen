// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-valid-pair-of-adjacent-digits-in-string/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s consisting only of digits. A valid pair is defined as two adjacent digits in s such that:
//
//
// 	The first digit is not equal to the second.
// 	Each digit in the pair appears in s exactly as many times as its numeric value.
//
//
// Return the first valid pair found in the string s when traversing from left to right. If no valid pair exists, return an empty string.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "2523533"
//
// Output: "23"
//
// Explanation:
//
// Digit '2' appears 2 times and digit '3' appears 3 times. Each digit in the pair "23" appears in s exactly as many times as its numeric value. Hence, the output is "23".
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= s.length <= 100
// 	s only consists of digits from '1' to '9'.

// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - String Sorts (array, string, number, radix-sort, counting-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting a large collection of fixed-length strings or integers, especially when the key range (alphabet size) is small. It is efficient for data with uniform key lengths.
//   • Idea: LSD Radix Sort sorts elements by processing digits or characters from the least significant to the most significant, using a stable counting sort for each position. It achieves a time complexity of O(W * (N + R)), where W is the key length, N is the number of items, and R is the radix.
//   • Invariants: After each pass 'd' (from 'w-1' down to '0'), the array 'a' is stably sorted based on characters from position 'd' to 'w-1'.; The 'count' array accurately reflects the frequency of each character at the current digit 'd' before cumulation.
//   • Tips: Utilize counting sort as the stable inner sorting algorithm for each digit pass.; Process characters or digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for variable-length strings without proper padding or specialized handling.; Can be slower than comparison sorts for small input sizes or very large radix (R).
// - Primality tests (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to determine if a single number is prime, especially for numbers where trial division up to its square root is computationally feasible.
//   • Idea: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This method checks for primality by attempting to find a non-trivial divisor up to the square root of the given number, running in O(sqrt(N)) time.
//   • Invariants: No integer k in the range [2, current_divisor - 1] has been found to divide n.; The current value current_divisor is a candidate divisor being tested against n.
//   • Tips: Only check numbers between 2 and sqrt(n).; Handle 2 as a special case before iterating.
//   • Pitfalls: O(sqrt(N)) complexity can be too slow for very large numbers.; Incorrectly handling edge cases like 0, 1, or 2.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
