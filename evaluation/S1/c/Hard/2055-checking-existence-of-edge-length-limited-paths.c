// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/checking-existence-of-edge-length-limited-paths/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// An undirected graph of n nodes is defined by edgeList, where edgeList[i] = [ui, vi, disi] denotes an edge between nodes ui and vi with distance disi. Note that there may be multiple edges between two nodes.
//
// Given an array queries, where queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj], your task is to determine for each queries[j] whether there is a path between pj and qj such that each edge on the path has a distance strictly less than limitj .
//
// Return a boolean array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and the jth value of answer is true if there is a path for queries[j] is true, and false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, edgeList = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8],[1,0,16]], queries = [[0,1,2],[0,2,5]]
// Output: [false,true]
// Explanation: The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16.
// For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query.
// For the second query, there is a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) of two edges with distances less than 5, thus we return true for this query.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= edgeList.length, queries.length <= 105
// 	edgeList[i].length == 3
// 	queries[j].length == 3
// 	0 <= ui, vi, pj, qj <= n - 1
// 	ui != vi
// 	pj != qj
// 	1 <= disi, limitj <= 109
// 	There may be multiple edges between two nodes.

// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, tree, array, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and efficiently perform union operations to merge sets or find the representative of an element's set.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: finding the representative of an element's set and merging two sets. With path compression and union by rank/size, these operations achieve nearly constant amortized time complexity, O(alpha(N)).
//   • Invariants: Each element `v` is either a root (parent[v] == v) or has a parent pointer to another element in its set.; The `find_set` operation, after path compression, ensures that all nodes on the path from `v` to its root directly point to the root.
//   • Tips: Implement path compression in `find_set` for optimal performance.; Use union by rank or union by size to keep trees flat and balanced.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting path compression or union by rank/size leads to O(N) worst-case operations.; Incorrectly merging sets by only updating one root without considering the other's rank/size.
// - Range Minimum Query (array, ds, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when range minimum queries are needed on an array where elements can be dynamically removed or merged, and Union-Find is employed to manage the active state or connectivity of indices.
//   • Idea: Union-Find can be adapted to assist in range minimum queries, particularly when elements are dynamically removed or merged. It helps maintain connectivity of active elements or segments, allowing efficient traversal to find the minimum among available items, often with near-constant amortized time per Union-Find operation.
//   • Invariants: The `find` operation correctly returns the canonical representative for any element `i`.; Each set in the Union-Find structure maintains a property (e.g., minimum value, next available index) relevant to its merged elements.
//   • Tips: Utilize path compression and union by rank/size for optimal Union-Find performance.; Store relevant properties (e.g., minimum value, next available index) within the representative of each set.
//   • Pitfalls: Union-Find alone does not directly provide range minimums; it typically manages connectivity or availability.; Naive iteration through active elements found by Union-Find can be too slow for large ranges.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
