// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-position-for-a-service-centre/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// A delivery company wants to build a new service center in a new city. The company knows the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map and wants to build the new center in a position such that the sum of the euclidean distances to all customers is minimum.
//
// Given an array positions where positions[i] = [xi, yi] is the position of the ith customer on the map, return the minimum sum of the euclidean distances to all customers.
//
// In other words, you need to choose the position of the service center [xcentre, ycentre] such that the following formula is minimized:
//
// Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted.
//
// Example:
// Input: positions = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
// Output: 4.00000
// Explanation: As shown, you can see that choosing [xcentre, ycentre] = [1, 1] will make the distance to each customer = 1, the sum of all distances is 4 which is the minimum possible we can achieve.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= positions.length <= 50
// 	positions[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= xi, yi <= 100

// - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance among a given set of N points in a 2D plane. It is particularly effective for large datasets where an O(N^2) approach is too slow.
//   • Idea: This divide-and-conquer algorithm finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively splitting the set of points and merging results. It achieves an optimal time complexity of O(N log N).
//   • Invariants: At the start of any recursive call, the input point set is sorted by X-coordinate.; The returned minimum distance 'd' for a subproblem is the true minimum distance among its points.
//   • Tips: Initial sorting by X-coordinate is crucial for efficient division of the point set.; Handle base cases (e.g., 2 or 3 points) with a simple brute-force distance calculation.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to sort points by Y-coordinate within the central strip can degrade performance to O(N^2).; Incorrectly defining the strip width or comparison range in the merge step can lead to incorrect results.
// - Ternary Search (interval, number, binary-search, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use Ternary Search to find the minimum or maximum of a unimodal or bitonic function over a continuous or discrete interval. It is effective when the function's derivative is hard to compute or unavailable.
//   • Idea: Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that repeatedly narrows down the search space for the extremum of a unimodal function by evaluating two points within the current interval. It reduces the search interval by one-third in each step, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function lies within the current interval [l, r].; The function value at m1 is compared with m2 to narrow the search.
//   • Tips: Ensure the function is strictly unimodal or bitonic within the search range.; Handle floating-point precision carefully for continuous functions.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying to non-unimodal functions yields incorrect results.; Floating-point errors can lead to incorrect bounds or infinite loops.
// - Minimum Enclosing Circle (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the smallest circle that contains all given points in a 2D plane, often with a requirement for expected linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: This algorithm iteratively constructs the Minimum Enclosing Circle (MEC) by considering points one by one, potentially updating the circle if a new point lies outside. It achieves an expected linear time complexity, O(N), through randomization.
//   • Invariants: The current circle C is the MEC for the subset of points processed so far.; If C is defined by 1 point p_i, it is the MEC of points processed so far that passes through p_i.
//   • Tips: Randomly shuffle input points to achieve expected linear time complexity.; The Minimum Enclosing Circle is always defined by 2 or 3 points on its boundary.
//   • Pitfalls: A naive implementation without randomization can lead to O(N^3) worst-case time complexity.; Floating-point precision issues can arise in geometric calculations, requiring careful handling.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
