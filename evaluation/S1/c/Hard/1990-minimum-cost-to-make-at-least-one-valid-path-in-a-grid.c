// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-at-least-one-valid-path-in-a-grid/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:
//
//
// 	1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
// 	2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
// 	3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
// 	4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])
//
//
// Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.
//
// You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.
//
// You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.
//
// Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: You will start at point (0, 0).
// The path to (3, 3) is as follows. (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (1, 3) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 0) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (2, 0) --> (2, 1) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (3, 3)
// The total cost = 3.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 100
// 	1 <= grid[i][j] <= 4
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Breadth-first search (graph, deque, array, 01-bfs)
//   • When to use: When finding the shortest path in a graph where edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1, or when minimizing operations where some operations are 'free' (cost 0) and others have a unit cost (cost 1).
//   • Idea: A graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source to all reachable nodes in a graph where edge weights are either 0 or 1. It uses a deque to prioritize 0-cost edges, achieving an optimal O(V + E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Nodes are added to the front of the deque if the edge weight is 0, and to the back if 1.; The distance `dist[u]` for any node `u` in the deque is either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.
//   • Tips: Use a deque: push 0-cost edges to the front, 1-cost edges to the back.; Mark nodes visited to avoid cycles and redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling visited states can lead to infinite loops or incorrect paths.; Forgetting to initialize distances properly before starting the traversal.
// - Minimum-cost flow - Successive shortest path algorithm (graph, array, greedy, dijkstra, bellman-ford)
//   • When to use: This algorithm finds a minimum-cost flow of a given amount from a source to a sink in a flow network. It is suitable when both flow capacity and edge costs are present.
//   • Idea: The successive shortest path algorithm iteratively finds augmenting paths with minimum cost in a residual graph, using shortest path algorithms like Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra with potentials, until the desired flow is achieved. Its complexity depends on the shortest path algorithm used and the number of augmentations.
//   • Invariants: The total flow pushed from source to sink never exceeds the sum of capacities of edges leaving the source.; For any edge (u, v) with flow f_uv, 0 <= f_uv <= capacity_uv.
//   • Tips: Use potentials with Dijkstra for non-negative edge costs in the residual graph.; Bellman-Ford is necessary if initial edge costs can be negative or if potentials are not used.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating potentials can lead to wrong shortest paths.; Forgetting to add reverse edges with negative costs in the residual graph.
// - Hungarian algorithm for solving the assignment problem (matrix, graph, greedy, bfs)
//   • When to use: Finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs or uniform-cost state-space searches. Explores states layer by layer.
//   • Idea: Explores all reachable nodes in a graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. It operates in O(V + E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same distance from the source.; All nodes visited so far have their shortest distance from the source determined.
//   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit.; Mark nodes as visited to prevent cycles and redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops.; Incorrectly handling disconnected components.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
