// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-string-with-lcp/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// We define the lcp matrix of any 0-indexed string word of n lowercase English letters as an n x n grid such that:
//
//
// 	lcp[i][j] is equal to the length of the longest common prefix between the substrings word[i,n-1] and word[j,n-1].
//
//
// Given an n x n matrix lcp, return the alphabetically smallest string word that corresponds to lcp. If there is no such string, return an empty string.
//
// A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. For example, "aabd" is lexicographically smaller than "aaca" because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and 'b' comes before 'c'.
//
// Example:
// Input: lcp = [[4,0,2,0],[0,3,0,1],[2,0,2,0],[0,1,0,1]]
// Output: "abab"
// Explanation: lcp corresponds to any 4 letter string with two alternating letters. The lexicographically smallest of them is "abab".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == lcp.length == lcp[i].length <= 1000
// 	0 <= lcp[i][j] <= n
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences of a pattern in a text, analyzing string periodicity, or counting distinct substrings. It is especially useful for processing extremely long or recursively defined strings where explicit construction is impossible.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm leverages a precomputed prefix function (LPS array) to avoid redundant comparisons during string searching, achieving linear time complexity. The prefix function itself determines the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix, enabling various string property analyses in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: For any index `i`, `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i]`.; During prefix function computation, `j` always represents the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i-1]` that is also a suffix.
//   • Tips: The prefix function `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix.; Concatenate pattern, a unique separator, and text (`P + # + T`) to find all pattern occurrences.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors with array indexing or the precise definition of the prefix function.; Incorrectly handling the unique separator character in concatenated strings, leading to false matches.
// - Range Minimum Query (array, ds, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when range minimum queries are needed on an array where elements can be dynamically removed or merged, and Union-Find is employed to manage the active state or connectivity of indices.
//   • Idea: Union-Find can be adapted to assist in range minimum queries, particularly when elements are dynamically removed or merged. It helps maintain connectivity of active elements or segments, allowing efficient traversal to find the minimum among available items, often with near-constant amortized time per Union-Find operation.
//   • Invariants: The `find` operation correctly returns the canonical representative for any element `i`.; Each set in the Union-Find structure maintains a property (e.g., minimum value, next available index) relevant to its merged elements.
//   • Tips: Utilize path compression and union by rank/size for optimal Union-Find performance.; Store relevant properties (e.g., minimum value, next available index) within the representative of each set.
//   • Pitfalls: Union-Find alone does not directly provide range minimums; it typically manages connectivity or availability.; Naive iteration through active elements found by Union-Find can be too slow for large ranges.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
