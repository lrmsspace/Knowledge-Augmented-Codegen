// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-area-to-cover-all-ones-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D binary array grid. You need to find 3 non-overlapping rectangles having non-zero areas with horizontal and vertical sides such that all the 1's in grid lie inside these rectangles.
//
// Return the minimum possible sum of the area of these rectangles.
//
// Note that the rectangles are allowed to touch.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
//
// Output: 5
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
//
// 	The 1's at (0, 0) and (1, 0) are covered by a rectangle of area 2.
// 	The 1's at (0, 2) and (1, 2) are covered by a rectangle of area 2.
// 	The 1 at (1, 1) is covered by a rectangle of area 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 30
// 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
// 	The input is generated such that there are at least three 1's in grid.

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
//   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
// - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When you need to calculate the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in sequential order. It efficiently handles both convex and non-convex polygons.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing the signed areas of trapezoids or triangles formed by its edges and a reference point/axis. It achieves O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sum accumulates the signed area contribution of processed edges.; The current vertex and the next vertex define an edge of the polygon.
//   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in sequential order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; The absolute value of the final result is the polygon's area.
//   • Pitfalls: Supplying vertices in a non-sequential or arbitrary order will yield an incorrect area.; Applying the formula to self-intersecting polygons will not give the true geometric area.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
