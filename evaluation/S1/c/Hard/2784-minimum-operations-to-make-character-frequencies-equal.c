// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-character-frequencies-equal/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s.
//
// A string t is called good if all characters of t occur the same number of times.
//
// You can perform the following operations any number of times:
//
//
//  Delete a character from s.
//  Insert a character in s.
//  Change a character in s to its next letter in the alphabet.
//
//
// Note that you cannot change 'z' to 'a' using the third operation.
//
// Return the minimum number of operations required to make s good.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "acab"
//
// Output: 1
//
// Explanation:
//
// We can make s good by deleting one occurrence of character 'a'.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= s.length <= 2 * 104
//  s contains only lowercase English letters.

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Data Compression (tree, heap, greedy, recursion, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to losslessly compress data by assigning shorter bit sequences to more frequent symbols, aiming for the shortest possible average code length. It is effective for data with non-uniform character distributions.
//   • Idea: Huffman coding is a greedy algorithm that constructs an optimal prefix code for a given set of symbols and their frequencies. It builds a binary tree (Huffman trie) by repeatedly merging the two nodes with the smallest frequencies, resulting in an encoding with O(N + K log K) time complexity, where N is input length and K is alphabet size.
//   • Invariants: The priority queue always contains valid Huffman nodes, each representing a subtree or a leaf character.; Every internal node in the Huffman tree has exactly two children, and its frequency is the sum of its children's frequencies.
//   • Tips: Use a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve and combine the two lowest-frequency nodes.; Represent the Huffman tree explicitly to generate codes and for decoding.
//   • Pitfalls: The overhead of storing the Huffman tree or frequency table can negate compression benefits for small inputs.; Not truly optimal for all data types; it's a statistical compression method.
// - Shortest Paths (array, graph, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: To find the path with the minimum total weight or cost between two vertices, or from a single source to all other reachable vertices, in an edge-weighted graph.
//   • Idea: Shortest path algorithms determine the path with the least cumulative weight between nodes in a graph. This often involves a dynamic programming approach, iteratively updating minimum distances to achieve an optimal O(V*E) or O(E log V) complexity.
//   • Invariants: distTo[v] always stores the minimum path length from the source to v discovered so far.; For any edge u -> v, if distTo[u] is final, then distTo[v] will eventually be min(distTo[v], distTo[u] + weight(u,v)).
//   • Tips: Initialize the source distance to 0 and all other distances to infinity.; Use a `distTo` array to store the current shortest distances from the source.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to detect or handle negative cycles, which can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.; Incorrectly initializing distances or edge relaxation logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
