// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-second-to-mark-indices-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two 1-indexed integer arrays, nums and, changeIndices, having lengths n and m, respectively.
//
// Initially, all indices in nums are unmarked. Your task is to mark all indices in nums.
//
// In each second, s, in order from 1 to m (inclusive), you can perform one of the following operations:
//
//
// 	Choose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrement nums[i] by 1.
// 	Set nums[changeIndices[s]] to any non-negative value.
// 	Choose an index i in the range [1, n], where nums[i] is equal to 0, and mark index i.
// 	Do nothing.
//
//
// Return an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,2,3], changeIndices = [1,3,2,2,2,2,3]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
// Second 1: Set nums[changeIndices[1]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,3].
// Second 2: Set nums[changeIndices[2]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,0].
// Second 3: Set nums[changeIndices[3]] to 0. nums becomes [0,0,0].
// Second 4: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.
// Second 5: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
// Second 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.
// Now all indices have been marked.
// It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second.
// Hence, the answer is 6.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == nums.length <= 5000
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 109
// 	1 <= m == changeIndices.length <= 5000
// 	1 <= changeIndices[i] <= n
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When searching for a specific element in a sorted collection or finding an optimal value over a monotonic function within a defined range. It efficiently reduces the search space by half in each step.
//   • Idea: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or determines a value that satisfies a monotonic predicate. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The potential answer always lies within the current search interval `[low, high]`.; All elements strictly less than `low` have been determined not to be the answer.
//   • Tips: Ensure the search space exhibits a monotonic property.; Carefully define the `low` and `high` bounds for the search interval.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating `low` or `high` bounds leading to infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing or loop conditions.
// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (array, heap, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when given a set of tasks with deadlines and durations, and the objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks without interruption.
//   • Idea: This greedy algorithm aims to maximize the number of jobs completed by prioritizing tasks that finish earliest. It typically involves sorting and using a min-heap, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed up to the current point have been considered for scheduling.; The set of jobs in the heap represents the jobs currently scheduled to meet their deadlines.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by their deadlines in ascending order.; Maintain a min-heap of durations for jobs currently scheduled.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing job count maximization with total duration or profit.; Failing to update the current time correctly after scheduling a job.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
