// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-robots-within-budget/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You have n robots. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, chargeTimes and runningCosts, both of length n. The ith robot costs chargeTimes[i] units to charge and costs runningCosts[i] units to run. You are also given an integer budget.
//
// The total cost of running k chosen robots is equal to max(chargeTimes) + k * sum(runningCosts), where max(chargeTimes) is the largest charge cost among the k robots and sum(runningCosts) is the sum of running costs among the k robots.
//
// Return the maximum number of consecutive robots you can run such that the total cost does not exceed budget.
//
// Example:
// Input: chargeTimes = [3,6,1,3,4], runningCosts = [2,1,3,4,5], budget = 25
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 
// It is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.
// To obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 * sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 which is less than 25.
// It can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.
//
// Constraints:
// chargeTimes.length == runningCosts.length == n
// 	1 <= n <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= chargeTimes[i], runningCosts[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= budget <= 1015

// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine to minimize the total weighted completion time, where each job has a processing time and a linear penalty coefficient.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine with linear penalty functions by sorting jobs based on a specific ratio. It achieves an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The partial schedule constructed so far is optimal for the jobs included.; For any two adjacent jobs 'j' and 'k' in the final schedule, if 'j' precedes 'k', then 'c_j/t_j >= c_k/t_k'.
//   • Tips: Derive the sorting criterion using an exchange argument for adjacent jobs.; The optimal order is determined by the ratio of cost coefficient to processing time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the sorting criterion, especially the ratio order.; Overlooking edge cases like zero processing times or zero penalty coefficients.
// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
//   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
//   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
