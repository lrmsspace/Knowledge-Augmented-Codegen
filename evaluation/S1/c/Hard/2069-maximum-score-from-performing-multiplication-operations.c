//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums and multipliers of size n and m respectively, where n >= m.
//
// You begin with a score of 0. You want to perform exactly m operations. On the ith operation (0-indexed) you will:
//
//
//     Choose one integer x from either the start or the end of the array nums.
//     Add multipliers[i] * x to your score.
//     
//         Note that multipliers[0] corresponds to the first operation, multipliers[1] to the second operation, and so on.
//     
//     
//     Remove x from nums.
//
//
// Return the maximum score after performing m operations.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
// Output: 14
// Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
// - Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.
// - Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.
// - Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.
// The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	m == multipliers.length
// 	1 <= m <= 300
// 	m <= n <= 105 
// 	-1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000

// - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
//   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
//   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
//   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
//   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
