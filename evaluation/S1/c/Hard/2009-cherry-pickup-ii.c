//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a rows x cols matrix grid representing a field of cherries where grid[i][j] represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the (i, j) cell.
//
// You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:
//
//
// 	Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and
// 	Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0, cols - 1).
//
//
// Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below:
//
//
// 	From a cell (i, j), robots can move to cell (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j), or (i + 1, j + 1).
// 	When any robot passes through a cell, It picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.
// 	When both robots stay in the same cell, only one takes the cherries.
// 	Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.
// 	Both robots should reach the bottom row in grid.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]
// Output: 24
// Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
// Cherries taken by Robot #1, (3 + 2 + 5 + 2) = 12.
// Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 5 + 5 + 1) = 12.
// Total of cherries: 12 + 12 = 24.
//
// Constraints:
// rows == grid.length
// 	cols == grid[i].length
// 	2 <= rows, cols <= 70
// 	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

// - Divide and Conquer DP (array, number, divide-and-conquer, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem can be broken into smaller, independent subproblems, and their solutions combine to solve the original. Also applicable when overlapping subproblems benefit from memoization or tabulation.
//   • Idea: This approach solves problems by recursively breaking them into smaller subproblems, solving each once, and storing results in a 2D table to avoid recomputation. It typically achieves a time complexity of O(N*M) or O(N^2) depending on state definition.
//   • Invariants: The DP table entry `dp[i][j]` correctly stores the optimal solution for the subproblem defined by `i` and `j`.; All subproblems `dp[x][y]` where `x < i` or `y < j` (or based on dependency order) are already computed and correct.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the state variables for your 2D DP table.; Establish the base cases before defining recursive relations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining state transitions or recurrence relations.; Missing or incorrect base cases leading to infinite recursion or wrong results.
// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Counting labeled graphs (number, dp-2d, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: When counting the total number of labeled graphs with a specific number of vertices and connected components. Useful for problems requiring enumeration of graph structures based on their connectivity properties.
//   • Idea: This technique uses dynamic programming to count labeled graphs with a given number of vertices and connected components by building up solutions from smaller subproblems. It leverages a recurrence relation that considers the component containing a specific vertex, leading to an O(N^2 * K) time complexity for N vertices and K components.
//   • Invariants: D[i][j] correctly stores the number of labeled graphs with i vertices and j components.; All C_s values for s < n are correctly precomputed before calculating D[n][k].
//   • Tips: Precompute binomial coefficients for efficiency.; Precompute the number of connected graphs (C_s) for all relevant s.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for the dynamic programming table.; Off-by-one errors in binomial coefficient calculations or array indexing.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
