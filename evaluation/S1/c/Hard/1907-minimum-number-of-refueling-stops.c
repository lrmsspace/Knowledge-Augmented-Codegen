// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-refueling-stops/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.
//
// There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array stations where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that the ith gas station is positioni miles east of the starting position and has fueli liters of gas.
//
// The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.
//
// Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.
//
// Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.
//
// Example:
// Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
// Output: 0
// Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= target, startFuel <= 109
// 	0 <= stations.length <= 500
// 	1 <= positioni < positioni+1 < target
// 	1 <= fueli < 109

// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (array, heap, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when given a set of tasks with deadlines and durations, and the objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks without interruption.
//   • Idea: This greedy algorithm aims to maximize the number of jobs completed by prioritizing tasks that finish earliest. It typically involves sorting and using a min-heap, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed up to the current point have been considered for scheduling.; The set of jobs in the heap represents the jobs currently scheduled to meet their deadlines.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by their deadlines in ascending order.; Maintain a min-heap of durations for jobs currently scheduled.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing job count maximization with total duration or profit.; Failing to update the current time correctly after scheduling a job.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Minimum spanning tree - Prim's algorithm (graph, heap, array, mst-prim, greedy, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree in a connected, weighted graph. It is efficient for both dense graphs (O(V^2)) and sparse graphs (O(E log V)) depending on the implementation.
//   • Idea: Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds an MST by iteratively adding the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the growing tree to a vertex outside the tree. It has a time complexity of O(V^2) for dense graphs using an adjacency matrix or O(E log V) for sparse graphs using a priority queue.
//   • Invariants: All selected vertices and edges form a connected component of the final MST.; For any unselected vertex `v`, `min_e[v]` stores the minimum weight of an edge connecting `v` to the currently selected component.
//   • Tips: For dense graphs, an O(V^2) implementation using an an adjacency matrix and simple array scans is efficient.; For sparse graphs, use a priority queue (min-heap) with an adjacency list to achieve O(E log V) complexity.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating the `min_e` array or priority queue entries can lead to an incorrect MST or performance issues.; Forgetting to mark vertices as 'selected' can lead to cycles or infinite loops.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
