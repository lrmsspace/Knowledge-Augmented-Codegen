#
# Problem Description:
# Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].
#
# Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
# Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
# Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 500
# 	nums.length == 2n
# 	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^3

# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Minimum Enclosing Circle (array, geometry, randomized, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the smallest circle that contains a given set of 2D points. It provides an expected linear time solution for this fundamental geometric problem.
#   • Idea: Welzl's algorithm finds the unique minimum enclosing circle for a set of points using a randomized incremental approach. It achieves an expected time complexity of O(N).
#   • Invariants: The current candidate circle `C` encloses all points `p_1, ..., p_i` processed so far.; If `p_i` is not contained in `C_{i-1}`, then `p_i` must lie on the boundary of `C_i`.
#   • Tips: Randomly permute input points to ensure expected O(N) performance.; The MEC is uniquely determined by either two points forming a diameter or three points on its boundary.
#   • Pitfalls: Not randomizing the input can lead to a worst-case O(N^3) performance.; Floating-point precision issues can cause incorrect boundary checks or point containment tests.
# - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
#   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
#   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
#   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
#   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
