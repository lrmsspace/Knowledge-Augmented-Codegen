#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
# Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
# 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

# - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
#   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
#   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
#   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
#   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Treap (Cartesian tree) (tree, recursion, binary-search)
#   • When to use: When you need a self-balancing binary search tree that supports efficient split and merge operations, often used for dynamic set management or range queries on mutable data.
#   • Idea: A Treap is a randomized binary search tree that maintains both BST properties on keys and heap properties on priorities (randomly assigned). It supports efficient operations like split and merge, typically with an average time complexity of O(log N).
#   • Invariants: For any node, its key is greater than or equal to all keys in its left subtree.; For any node, its key is less than all keys in its right subtree.
#   • Tips: Understand the recursive nature of Split and Merge operations.; Randomly assign priorities (Y values) to ensure probabilistic balancing.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrect handling of null pointers or empty subtrees in recursion.; Forgetting to update parent pointers or root pointers after operations.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
#   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
