# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.
#
# Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.
#
# Example:
# Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
# Output: "c"
# Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= letters.length <= 104
# 	letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
# 	letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# 	letters contains at least two different characters.
# 	target is a lowercase English letter.

# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
#   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
#   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
#   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
#   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
# - String Sorts (array, string, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to sort a collection of strings lexicographically, especially when string lengths vary or are large, and the character set is limited.
#   • Idea: This algorithm sorts an array of strings lexicographically by recursively applying a counting sort-like distribution based on characters from most significant to least significant digit. It typically achieves O(N*L + R*L) time complexity, where N is the number of strings, L is the average string length, and R is the radix size.
#   • Invariants: All strings in the current `a[lo...hi]` sub-array share a common prefix of length `d`.; After the distribution pass for character `d`, `aux` contains strings from `a[lo...hi]` stably sorted by their `d`-th character.
#   • Tips: Use an auxiliary array for stable distribution during each pass to maintain relative order.; Implement a cutoff to insertion sort for small sub-arrays to improve performance due to lower overhead.
#   • Pitfalls: Can have high overhead for small N or short strings compared to comparison sorts.; Potentially memory intensive due to the auxiliary array and recursion stack depth proportional to max string length.
# - Substring Search (string, array, kmp)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to find all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern string within a larger text string efficiently. It is particularly useful when the pattern might have significant self-overlapping prefixes and suffixes, allowing for linear time complexity.
#   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently searches for occurrences of a pattern within a text by avoiding redundant comparisons. It preprocesses the pattern to build a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) or Longest Proper Prefix Suffix (LPS) array, achieving O(N + M) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: During DFA construction, dfa[c][j] correctly stores the next state if character c is encountered in state j.; During DFA construction, x maintains the length of the longest proper prefix of pattern[0...j-1] that is also a suffix of pattern[0...j-1].
#   • Tips: Precompute the LPS array or DFA for the pattern to guide the search.; The LPS array indicates the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix, enabling efficient shifts.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrect construction of the LPS array or DFA is a common source of errors.; High constant factors for small alphabets or short patterns might make simpler algorithms faster.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
