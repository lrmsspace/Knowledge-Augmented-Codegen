# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-convert-string/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either 'X' or 'O'.
#
# A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.
#
# Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "XXX"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: XXX -> OOO
# We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.
#
# Constraints:
# 3 <= s.length <= 1000
# 	s[i] is either 'X' or 'O'.

# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use to efficiently represent all suffixes of a string in a compressed form, ideal for various string problems like pattern matching or counting distinct substrings.
#   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a minimal Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that accepts all suffixes of a given string, offering O(N) time construction and O(N) memory complexity.
#   • Invariants: Every state in the automaton represents a set of substrings of the original string.; Each state's longest path from the initial state corresponds to its longest string.
#   • Tips: Understand the definition of states and transitions, and their relationship to substrings.; Leverage its linear time and space complexity for efficient string processing on large inputs.
#   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm can be complex and challenging to implement correctly.; Debugging state transitions, suffix links, and their properties requires careful attention.
# - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (heap, interval, greedy, simulation)
#   • When to use: When needing to find an optimal schedule for a set of jobs, each with a deadline and duration, typically to maximize completed jobs or minimize total lateness. This approach often involves processing jobs based on deadlines and dynamically selecting tasks.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal job schedule by processing jobs sorted by their deadlines, using a priority queue to manage available tasks. It greedily selects jobs with the shortest run-time that can be completed within the current time window, achieving an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All jobs with deadlines greater than the current job's deadline have been considered.; The priority queue contains jobs that can potentially be scheduled within the current time window.
#   • Tips: Sort jobs by deadline in descending order to process later deadlines first.; Use a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve the job with the least run-time.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly sorting jobs (e.g., ascending deadline or by duration).; Not handling overlapping time intervals or deadlines properly.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
