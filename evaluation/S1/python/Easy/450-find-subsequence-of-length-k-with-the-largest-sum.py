# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-subsequence-of-length-k-with-the-largest-sum/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You want to find a subsequence of nums of length k that has the largest sum.
#
# Return any such subsequence as an integer array of length k.
#
# A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
# Output: [3,3]
# Explanation:
# The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
# 	-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
# 	1 <= k <= nums.length

# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
#   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, segment-tree, coordinate-compress)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence such that elements in the subsequence are in strictly increasing order, preserving their original relative order.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search or a segment tree.
#   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or DP array) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index 'i', 'tails[i]' stores the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.
#   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array where dp[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Binary search is used to find the correct position for the current element in the dp array.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates for strictly increasing versus non-decreasing requirements.
# - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: Use Merge Sort when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or linked lists where random access is costly.
#   • Idea: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N).
#   • Invariants: Each sub-array passed to merge is sorted.; The merge operation combines two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array.
#   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to maintain stability.; Consider iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits.
#   • Pitfalls: High space complexity due to auxiliary arrays.; Overhead of recursion can be significant for small inputs.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
