# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-greatest-value-in-each-row/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers.
#
# Perform the following operation until grid becomes empty:
#
#
# 	Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.
# 	Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.
#
#
# Note that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.
#
# Return the answer after performing the operations described above.
#
# Example:
# Input: grid = [[1,2,4],[3,3,1]]
# Output: 8
# Explanation: The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.
# - In the first operation, we remove 4 from the first row and 3 from the second row (notice that, there are two cells with value 3 and we can remove any of them). We add 4 to the answer.
# - In the second operation, we remove 2 from the first row and 3 from the second row. We add 3 to the answer.
# - In the third operation, we remove 1 from the first row and 1 from the second row. We add 1 to the answer.
# The final answer = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.
#
# Constraints:
# m == grid.length
# 	n == grid[i].length
# 	1 <= m, n <= 50
# 	1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

# - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: Use Merge Sort when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or linked lists where random access is costly.
#   • Idea: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N).
#   • Invariants: Each sub-array passed to merge is sorted.; The merge operation combines two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array.
#   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to maintain stability.; Consider iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits.
#   • Pitfalls: High space complexity due to auxiliary arrays.; Overhead of recursion can be significant for small inputs.
# - Finding the rank of a matrix (matrix, simulation, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to determine the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix. It's also applicable for understanding the dimension of the vector space spanned by the matrix's rows or columns.
#   • Idea: Determines the rank of a matrix by transforming it into row echelon form using Gaussian elimination. The rank is the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form, with a time complexity of O(N^3).
#   • Invariants: The number of non-zero rows processed so far equals the current rank.; All elements below the pivot in the current column are zeroed out.
#   • Tips: Always choose the largest absolute value pivot for numerical stability.; Swap rows to bring a non-zero element to the pivot position.
#   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect zero checks.; Forgetting to increment rank only when a valid pivot is found.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
