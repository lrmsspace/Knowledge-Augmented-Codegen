#
# Problem Description:
# The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.
#
#
# 	For example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.
#
#
# Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums. 
#
# Note: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.
#
# An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,3]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The 4 subsets of [1,3] are:
# - The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
# - [1] has an XOR total of 1.
# - [3] has an XOR total of 3.
# - [1,3] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 3 = 2.
# 0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 12
# 	1 <= nums[i] <= 20

# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
#   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
# - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
#   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
#   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
#   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
#   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
#   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
#   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
