# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-target-indices-after-sorting-array/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a target element target.
#
# A target index is an index i such that nums[i] == target.
#
# Return a list of the target indices of nums after sorting nums in non-decreasing order. If there are no target indices, return an empty list. The returned list must be sorted in increasing order.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 2
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
# The indices where nums[i] == 2 are 1 and 2.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 100
# 	1 <= nums[i], target <= 100

# - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, even if O(N) auxiliary space is acceptable. It is suitable for sorting linked lists efficiently.
#   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and uses O(N) auxiliary space.
#   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo..mid]` and right subarray `a[mid+1..hi]` are individually sorted.; After each recursive call `sort(a, aux, sub_lo, sub_hi)`, the subarray `a[sub_lo..sub_hi]` is sorted.
#   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for the merging step to simplify implementation and ensure stability.; Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
#   • Pitfalls: The primary disadvantage is the requirement for O(N) extra space for the auxiliary array.; Implementing an in-place merge without significant extra space is complex and often less efficient.
# - bucket-sort (array, bucket-sort)
#   • When to use: When the input elements are uniformly distributed across a specific range, allowing for efficient partitioning and sorting.
#   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket, then concatenates them. It achieves O(N+K) average time complexity, where N is elements and K is buckets, assuming uniform distribution.
#   • Invariants: All elements from the input are initially present in the unsorted collection.; After distribution, each element resides in exactly one bucket, corresponding to its value range.
#   • Tips: Choose the number of buckets carefully based on data range and distribution.; Use an efficient sorting algorithm for individual buckets (e.g., insertion sort for small buckets).
#   • Pitfalls: Poor performance with non-uniform data distribution, leading to elements clustering in few buckets.; Requires knowing the range of input values beforehand to define bucket boundaries.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
