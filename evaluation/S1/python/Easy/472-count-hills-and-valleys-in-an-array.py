# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-hills-and-valleys-in-an-array/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. An index i is part of a hill in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are smaller than nums[i]. Similarly, an index i is part of a valley in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are larger than nums[i]. Adjacent indices i and j are part of the same hill or valley if nums[i] == nums[j].
#
# Note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on both the left and right of the index.
#
# Return the number of hills and valleys in nums.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,4,1,1,6,5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# At index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 2 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley.
# At index 1: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 2 and 1. Since 4 > 2 and 4 > 1, index 1 is a hill. 
# At index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 2 is a valley.
# At index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 3 is a valley, but note that it is part of the same valley as index 2.
# At index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 6 are 1 and 5. Since 6 > 1 and 6 > 5, index 4 is a hill.
# At index 5: There is no non-equal neighbor of 5 on the right, so index 5 is neither a hill nor a valley. 
# There are 3 hills and valleys so we return 3.
#
# Constraints:
# 3 <= nums.length <= 100
# 	1 <= nums[i] <= 100

# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
# - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, stack, simulation, monotonic-stack)
#   • When to use: This technique is used to answer Range Minimum Queries efficiently on a static array by transforming them into Lowest Common Ancestor queries on a Cartesian Tree.
#   • Idea: This approach solves Range Minimum Query problems by constructing a Cartesian Tree from the input array, where the root of any subtree is its minimum element. RMQ for a given range then reduces to finding the Lowest Common Ancestor of the range's endpoints in this tree, allowing O(N) construction and O(1) query time after O(N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian Tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the subtree rooted at `u`.; For any node `u`, all nodes in its left subtree have indices smaller than `index(u)`, and all nodes in its right subtree have indices larger than `index(u)`.
#   • Tips: A Cartesian Tree is a binary tree where each node's value is less than its children's values, and an in-order traversal yields the original array.; Utilize a monotonic stack to construct the Cartesian Tree in linear O(N) time.
#   • Pitfalls: Correctly implementing the monotonic stack for Cartesian Tree construction can be challenging.; Edge cases, such as an empty stack or handling the last elements during tree building, must be managed carefully.
# - Finding repetitions (string, array, z-function, enumeration)
#   • When to use: This algorithm efficiently finds all repetitions (periodic substrings) within a given string by combining divide-and-conquer with the Z-function. It is particularly useful for identifying overlapping or crossing periodic patterns.
#   • Idea: The Main-Lorentz algorithm finds all repetitions in a string by recursively splitting it into halves and identifying 'crossing repetitions' using the Z-function. This approach achieves an optimal O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: For any fixed `cntr` position, all identified crossing repetitions have a total length of $2 	imes (|u| - cntr)$.; The segment $u[cntr - k_1 	ext{ to } cntr - 1]$ is identical to $u[|u| - k_1 	ext{ to } |u| - 1]$.
#   • Tips: Employ divide-and-conquer to break the problem into subproblems for repetitions within halves and crossing repetitions.; Utilize the Z-function to compute $k_1$ and $k_2$ values in O(1) for each `cntr` position, speeding up crossing repetition detection.
#   • Pitfalls: Correctly identifying and defining 'crossing repetitions' is the most intricate part of the algorithm.; Careful implementation of the Z-function for both the original and reversed string segments is crucial.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
