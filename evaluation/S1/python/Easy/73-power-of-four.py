# Problem Description:
# Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return false.
#
# An integer n is a power of four, if there exists an integer x such that n == 4x.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 16
# Output: true
#
# Constraints:
# -231 <= n <= 231 - 1

# - Bit manipulation (number, counting, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use for efficient low-level operations on integers, checking properties related to powers of two, or manipulating individual bits. It provides constant-time solutions for many numerical checks.
#   • Idea: This card covers fundamental bitwise operations for checking number properties like divisibility by powers of two, identifying powers of two, and manipulating individual bits. These operations typically run in O(1) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: For a positive integer `n`, `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` if and only if `n` is a power of two.; An integer `n` is divisible by `2^k` if and only if its `k` least significant bits are all zero, which is checked by `(n & ((1 << k) - 1)) == 0`.
#   • Tips: Use `n & 1` to efficiently check if a number `n` is odd or even.; The expression `1 << k` calculates 2 raised to the power of `k`.
#   • Pitfalls: When checking if a number is a power of two, remember to handle the `n == 0` case separately as `0 & (-1)` is `0`.; Be cautious with integer overflow when performing left shifts (`1 << k`) for large `k` values.
# - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, interval, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find or count all integer solutions (x, y) for a linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, especially when solutions are constrained within specific intervals for x and y.
#   • Idea: This method finds all integer solutions to a linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c within given x and y intervals. It first finds a particular solution, then uses properties of the general solution to determine the valid range for x, and enumerates solutions in O(N) time where N is the number of solutions.
#   • Invariants: The current (x, y) pair always satisfies the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c.; The current x value is an integer and satisfies the effective bounds l_x <= x <= r_x.
#   • Tips: Pre-divide coefficients a, b, c by gcd(a, b) to simplify the equation.; Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find an initial particular solution (x0, y0).
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to check if c is divisible by gcd(a, b) before proceeding, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly applying the shifting logic for x and y bounds, resulting in an invalid solution range.
# - Garner's algorithm
#  (number, array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when reconstructing a large integer from a system of congruences with pairwise coprime moduli, offering an alternative to the direct Chinese Remainder Theorem approach.
#   • Idea: Garner's algorithm efficiently reconstructs an integer from its remainders modulo a set of pairwise coprime numbers, by computing its mixed radix representation coefficients. It typically runs in O(k^2 log M) time, where k is the number of moduli and M is the maximum modulus, assuming modular inverse takes log M time.
#   • Invariants: At the start of iteration j, the partial sum $V_{j-1}$ satisfies $V_{j-1} \equiv a_i \pmod{p_i}$ for all $i < j$.; For each iteration j, the coefficient $x_j$ is uniquely determined in the range $[0, p_j - 1]$.
#   • Tips: Ensure all moduli are pairwise coprime for a unique solution.; Precompute modular inverses for efficiency, especially if many are needed.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating modular inverses, leading to wrong coefficients.; Not handling large intermediate products, which can cause integer overflow.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
