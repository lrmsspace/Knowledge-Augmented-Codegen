# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
#
# A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 3
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
# 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

# - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
#   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
#   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
#   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
#   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Search for connected components in a graph (stack, graph, dfs, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when the goal is to identify distinct groups of interconnected nodes within a graph, or to find all nodes reachable from a specific starting point.
#   • Idea: Depth-First Search (DFS) explores a graph by traversing as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It efficiently finds connected components by visiting all reachable nodes from an unvisited starting point, typically with O(V+E) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All nodes in the current DFS path from the start node to the current node are on the recursion stack.; Any node marked as visited will not be re-processed by the current DFS call.
#   • Tips: Maintain a 'visited' status for each node to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Iterate through all nodes and start DFS if a node is unvisited to find all components.
#   • Pitfalls: Excessive recursion depth can lead to stack overflow errors for large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited results in infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
#   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
#   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.
