# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-maximum-number-of-string-pairs/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed array words consisting of distinct strings.
#
# The string words[i] can be paired with the string words[j] if:
#
#
# 	The string words[i] is equal to the reversed string of words[j].
# 	0 <= i < j < words.length.
#
#
# Return the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the array words.
#
# Note that each string can belong in at most one pair.
#
# Example:
# Input: words = ["cd","ac","dc","ca","zz"]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: In this example, we can form 2 pair of strings in the following way:
# - We pair the 0th string with the 2nd string, as the reversed string of word[0] is "dc" and is equal to words[2].
# - We pair the 1st string with the 3rd string, as the reversed string of word[1] is "ca" and is equal to words[3].
# It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= words.length <= 50
# 	words[i].length == 2
# 	words consists of distinct strings.
# 	words[i] contains only lowercase English letters.

# - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
#   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
#   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
# - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (number, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the shortest paths between all possible pairs of vertices in a graph. It is particularly suitable for dense graphs or when negative edge weights are present, as long as no negative cycles are reachable.
#   • Idea: Floyd-Warshall is a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It iteratively considers all possible intermediate vertices to update path distances, achieving an O(V^3) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: After the k-th iteration, dist[i][j] contains the shortest path from i to j considering only vertices 0 to k-1 as intermediate nodes.; For any pair (i, j), dist[i][j] is always greater than or equal to the true shortest path distance from i to j (or infinity if unreachable).
#   • Tips: Initialize distances: direct edge weights, infinity for no direct edge, zero for self-loops.; The outermost loop must iterate through intermediate vertices (k).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrect loop order (k not outermost) leads to incorrect results.; Integer overflow with large path sums if not using appropriate data types.
# - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
#   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
#   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
#   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
#   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
