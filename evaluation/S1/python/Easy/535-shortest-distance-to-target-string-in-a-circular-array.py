# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-to-target-string-in-a-circular-array/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed circular string array words and a string target. A circular array means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.
#
#
# 	Formally, the next element of words[i] is words[(i + 1) % n] and the previous element of words[i] is words[(i - 1 + n) % n], where n is the length of words.
#
#
# Starting from startIndex, you can move to either the next word or the previous word with 1 step at a time.
#
# Return the shortest distance needed to reach the string target. If the string target does not exist in words, return -1.
#
# Example:
# Input: words = ["hello","i","am","leetcode","hello"], target = "hello", startIndex = 1
# Output: 1
# Explanation: We start from index 1 and can reach "hello" by
# - moving 3 units to the right to reach index 4.
# - moving 2 units to the left to reach index 4.
# - moving 4 units to the right to reach index 0.
# - moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 0.
# The shortest distance to reach "hello" is 1.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= words.length <= 100
# 	1 <= words[i].length <= 100
# 	words[i] and target consist of only lowercase English letters.
# 	0 <= startIndex < words.length

# - Minimum Enclosing Circle (array, geometry, randomized, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the smallest circle that contains a given set of 2D points. It provides an expected linear time solution for this fundamental geometric problem.
#   • Idea: Welzl's algorithm finds the unique minimum enclosing circle for a set of points using a randomized incremental approach. It achieves an expected time complexity of O(N).
#   • Invariants: The current candidate circle `C` encloses all points `p_1, ..., p_i` processed so far.; If `p_i` is not contained in `C_{i-1}`, then `p_i` must lie on the boundary of `C_i`.
#   • Tips: Randomly permute input points to ensure expected O(N) performance.; The MEC is uniquely determined by either two points forming a diameter or three points on its boundary.
#   • Pitfalls: Not randomizing the input can lead to a worst-case O(N^3) performance.; Floating-point precision issues can cause incorrect boundary checks or point containment tests.
# - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
#   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
#   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
#   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
#   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
