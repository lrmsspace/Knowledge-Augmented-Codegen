# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/account-balance-after-rounded-purchase/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# Initially, you have a bank account balance of 100 dollars.
#
# You are given an integer purchaseAmount representing the amount you will spend on a purchase in dollars, in other words, its price.
#
# When making the purchase, first the purchaseAmount is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. Let us call this value roundedAmount. Then, roundedAmount dollars are removed from your bank account.
#
# Return an integer denoting your final bank account balance after this purchase.
#
# Notes:
#
#
# 	0 is considered to be a multiple of 10 in this problem.
# 	When rounding, 5 is rounded upward (5 is rounded to 10, 15 is rounded to 20, 25 to 30, and so on).
#
# Example:
# Input: purchaseAmount = 9
#
# Output: 90
#
# Explanation:
#
# The nearest multiple of 10 to 9 is 10. So your account balance becomes 100 - 10 = 90.
#
# Constraints:
# 0 <= purchaseAmount <= 100

# - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
#   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
#   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
#   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
#   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
#   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
#   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
# - Minimum Enclosing Circle (geometry, number, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the smallest circle that contains all given points in a 2D plane, often with a requirement for expected linear time complexity.
#   • Idea: This algorithm iteratively constructs the Minimum Enclosing Circle (MEC) by considering points one by one, potentially updating the circle if a new point lies outside. It achieves an expected linear time complexity, O(N), through randomization.
#   • Invariants: The current circle C is the MEC for the subset of points processed so far.; If C is defined by 1 point p_i, it is the MEC of points processed so far that passes through p_i.
#   • Tips: Randomly shuffle input points to achieve expected linear time complexity.; The Minimum Enclosing Circle is always defined by 2 or 3 points on its boundary.
#   • Pitfalls: A naive implementation without randomization can lead to O(N^3) worst-case time complexity.; Floating-point precision issues can arise in geometric calculations, requiring careful handling.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
