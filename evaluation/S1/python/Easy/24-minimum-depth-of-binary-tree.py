# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
#
# The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
#
# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 2
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
# 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

# - Breadth-first search (graph, queue, array, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or when exploring all reachable nodes level by level. It is also suitable for problems requiring traversal of all nodes at a specific distance from a source.
#   • Idea: Breadth-first search systematically explores a graph level by level, ensuring that all nodes at distance k are visited before any nodes at distance k+1. It finds the shortest path in terms of number of edges for unweighted graphs in O(V + E) time.
#   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue have been discovered and marked, but their adjacent nodes have not yet been fully explored.; For any node v marked as visited, distTo[v] stores the shortest path length from the source s to v.
#   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit.; Mark nodes as visited to prevent cycles and redundant processing.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops or incorrect paths.; Not handling disconnected graphs correctly.
# - Lowest Common Ancestor - Farach-Colton and Bender Algorithm (tree, array, dfs)
#   • When to use: When frequent LCA queries are needed on a static tree, and optimal query time is critical. It's suitable for scenarios requiring O(1) query time after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a tree by reducing the problem to Range Minimum Query (RMQ) on an Euler tour. It preprocesses the tree in O(N) time using DFS to build an array of nodes and their depths, then answers LCA queries in O(1) time.
#   • Invariants: The Euler tour array contains every edge traversed twice, and each node appears at least once.; The depth array stores the correct distance from the root for each node's occurrence in the Euler tour.
#   • Tips: Perform a DFS to construct the Euler tour and depth array.; Store both the node identifier and its depth during the Euler tour.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the start and end indices for the RMQ on the Euler tour.; Off-by-one errors when mapping Euler tour indices to original nodes or depths.
# - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
#   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
#   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.

# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
