# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-tilt/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt.
#
# The tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is treated as 0. The rule is similar if the node does not have a right child.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 
# Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
# Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
# 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

# - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
#   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
#   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
#   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
#   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: When you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It is ideal for scenarios requiring both fast query and update operations on an array.
#   • Idea: A Fenwick tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is an array-based data structure that efficiently calculates prefix sums and updates individual elements in an array. It supports both point updates and prefix sum queries in O(log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: Each `T[i]` stores the sum of a specific range `[g(i), i]` from the original array.; The `sum(idx)` function correctly aggregates values from `A[0]` to `A[idx]`.
#   • Tips: Understand the bit manipulation (`i & -i`) for navigating parent/child relationships.; Consistently choose and apply either 0-based or 1-based indexing throughout the implementation.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0-based versus 1-based indexing can lead to off-by-one errors.; Forgetting to initialize the tree or performing updates incorrectly will yield wrong results.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
