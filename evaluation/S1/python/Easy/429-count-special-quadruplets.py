# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-special-quadruplets/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, return the number of distinct quadruplets (a, b, c, d) such that:
#
#
# 	nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d], and
# 	a < b < c < d
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,6]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The only quadruplet that satisfies the requirement is (0, 1, 2, 3) because 1 + 2 + 3 == 6.
#
# Constraints:
# 4 <= nums.length <= 50
# 	1 <= nums[i] <= 100

# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Burnside's lemma / Pólya enumeration theorem (array, number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting the number of distinct configurations or arrangements of objects under a set of symmetry operations, where configurations are considered identical if one can be transformed into another by a group action.
#   • Idea: Burnside's Lemma and Pólya Enumeration Theorem are combinatorial tools used to count the number of distinct objects under a group of symmetries. Both typically involve iterating through group elements and analyzing permutation cycle structures, often resulting in polynomial time complexity depending on group size and element analysis.
#   • Invariants: The set of group elements considered remains consistent throughout the summation.; Each group element's cycle decomposition is correctly identified.
#   • Tips: Identify the group of symmetry operations acting on the objects.; For each group element, determine its permutation cycle structure.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the full set of distinct group operations.; Errors in determining the cycle structure of permutations.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
