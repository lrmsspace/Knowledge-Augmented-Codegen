#
# Problem Description:
# Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.
#
# Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].
#
#
# 	For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
# Output: true
# Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104
# 	s and goal consist of lowercase letters.

# - Suffix Automaton (string, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently process all substrings or suffixes of a given string, especially for counting distinct substrings, finding occurrences, or other complex string pattern problems. It provides linear time solutions for many tasks.
#   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a directed acyclic graph that compactly represents all distinct substrings of a given string. It enables solving a wide range of string-related problems in linear time, typically O(N) or O(N log A) where N is string length and A is alphabet size.
#   • Invariants: Every path from the initial state corresponds to a distinct substring of the original string.; Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end positions.
#   • Tips: Understand the two types of links: suffix links (parent) and transition links (children).; Construction is typically incremental, adding characters one by one.
#   • Pitfalls: Implementation complexity is high; careful handling of state creation and link updates is crucial.; Off-by-one errors in length calculations or suffix link assignments are common.
# - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
#   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
#   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
#   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
# - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
#   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
#   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
#   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
#   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
