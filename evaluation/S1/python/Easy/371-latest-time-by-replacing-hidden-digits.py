# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/latest-time-by-replacing-hidden-digits/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a string time in the form of  hh:mm, where some of the digits in the string are hidden (represented by ?).
#
# The valid times are those inclusively between 00:00 and 23:59.
#
# Return the latest valid time you can get from time by replacing the hidden digits.
#
# Example:
# Input: time = "2?:?0"
# Output: "23:50"
# Explanation: The latest hour beginning with the digit '2' is 23 and the latest minute ending with the digit '0' is 50.
#
# Constraints:
# time is in the format hh:mm.
# 	It is guaranteed that you can produce a valid time from the given string.

# - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (heap, interval, greedy, simulation)
#   • When to use: When needing to find an optimal schedule for a set of jobs, each with a deadline and duration, typically to maximize completed jobs or minimize total lateness. This approach often involves processing jobs based on deadlines and dynamically selecting tasks.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal job schedule by processing jobs sorted by their deadlines, using a priority queue to manage available tasks. It greedily selects jobs with the shortest run-time that can be completed within the current time window, achieving an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All jobs with deadlines greater than the current job's deadline have been considered.; The priority queue contains jobs that can potentially be scheduled within the current time window.
#   • Tips: Sort jobs by deadline in descending order to process later deadlines first.; Use a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve the job with the least run-time.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly sorting jobs (e.g., ascending deadline or by duration).; Not handling overlapping time intervals or deadlines properly.
# - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use to efficiently represent all suffixes of a string in a compressed form, ideal for various string problems like pattern matching or counting distinct substrings.
#   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a minimal Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that accepts all suffixes of a given string, offering O(N) time construction and O(N) memory complexity.
#   • Invariants: Every state in the automaton represents a set of substrings of the original string.; Each state's longest path from the initial state corresponds to its longest string.
#   • Tips: Understand the definition of states and transitions, and their relationship to substrings.; Leverage its linear time and space complexity for efficient string processing on large inputs.
#   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm can be complex and challenging to implement correctly.; Debugging state transitions, suffix links, and their properties requires careful attention.
# - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use when a problem can be solved by making the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping this leads to a globally optimal solution. This strategy is often simpler and faster than dynamic programming.
#   • Idea: The greedy algorithm makes the best choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum, without reconsidering previous choices. Its time complexity is typically O(N log N) or O(N).
#   • Invariants: At each step, the chosen element is the best available according to the greedy criterion.; The partial solution constructed so far remains optimal for the subproblem considered.
#   • Tips: Prove correctness by exchange argument or induction.; Sort input data if it helps identify the greedy choice.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to prove the greedy choice property.; Making a locally optimal choice that prevents a global optimum.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
