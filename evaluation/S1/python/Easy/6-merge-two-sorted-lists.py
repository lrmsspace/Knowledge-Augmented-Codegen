# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
#
# Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
#
# Return the head of the merged linked list.
#
# Example:
# Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
# 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
# 	Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

# - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or external sorting where data might not fit in memory.
#   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and requires O(N) auxiliary space.
#   • Invariants: The elements `index[lo...k-1]` are sorted and contain the smallest `k-lo` elements from the original `aux[lo...mid]` and `aux[mid+1...hi]` segments.; Pointer `i` always indicates the next element to consider from the left sorted sub-array (`aux[lo...mid]`).
#   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to ensure stability.; Consider an iterative bottom-up approach to avoid recursion overhead.
#   • Pitfalls: High auxiliary space complexity (O(N)) can be a concern for memory-constrained systems.; Recursive calls can lead to stack overflow for very large inputs without tail call optimization.
# - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
#   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
#   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
#   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
# - Minimum spanning tree - Prim's algorithm (graph, mst-prim, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree in a connected, undirected, weighted graph. It is often preferred for dense graphs due to its O(V^2) or O(E log V) complexity.
#   • Idea: Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds a minimum spanning tree by iteratively adding the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the growing tree to one outside it. It typically runs in O(E log V) time with a binary heap or O(V^2) with an adjacency matrix.
#   • Invariants: The set of vertices already included in the MST forms a connected component.; For any vertex not yet in the MST, its associated key/distance stores the minimum weight of an edge connecting it to a vertex already in the MST.
#   • Tips: Use a priority queue to efficiently retrieve the minimum weight edge connecting to the MST.; Initialize distances for all vertices to infinity, except the starting vertex (0).
#   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for disconnected graphs; it will only find an MST for the component of the starting vertex.; Forgetting to handle edge cases like graphs with no edges or a single vertex.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
