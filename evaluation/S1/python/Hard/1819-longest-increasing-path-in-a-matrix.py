# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.
#
# From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).
#
# Example:
# Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
#
# Constraints:
# m == matrix.length
# 	n == matrix[i].length
# 	1 <= m, n <= 200
# 	0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1

# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
#   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
#   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
# - Depth-first search (graph, array, stack, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use DFS when you need to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, detect cycles, or perform topological sorting in a graph. It is suitable for problems requiring deep exploration before backtracking.
#   • Idea: Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically running in O(V + E) time for graphs.
#   • Invariants: All nodes currently on the recursion stack (or explicit stack) are part of the current path from the source.; Once a node `v` is marked `visited`, it will not be processed again by the main traversal logic.
#   • Tips: Use a `visited` array or set to track explored nodes.; Pass the parent node in recursive calls to correctly detect cycles.
#   • Pitfalls: Risk of stack overflow for very deep graphs with recursive implementations.; Failure to use a `visited` array leads to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, matrix, matrix-exp, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to count the number of paths of a specific length between all pairs of vertices in a graph, or to find reachability in a fixed number of steps.
#   • Idea: This algorithm leverages matrix exponentiation to find the number of paths of a fixed length `k` between all pairs of vertices in a graph. Each matrix multiplication step extends path lengths by one, resulting in an O(N^3 log K) time complexity for an N-vertex graph.
#   • Invariants: After `m` matrix multiplications, `C_m[i][j]` stores the number of paths of length `m` from `i` to `j`.; The initial adjacency matrix `G` remains constant throughout the exponentiation process.
#   • Tips: Represent the graph as an adjacency matrix where `G[i][j]` is the number of direct edges.; Matrix multiplication `C_k * G` yields `C_{k+1}` for path counts.
#   • Pitfalls: Standard matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to O(N^3 log K) overall time complexity.; Memory usage is O(N^2) for storing matrices, which can be prohibitive for very large graphs.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
