# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/tallest-billboard/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side. Each steel support must be an equal height.
#
# You are given a collection of rods that can be welded together. For example, if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of length 6.
#
# Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation. If you cannot support the billboard, return 0.
#
# Example:
# Input: rods = [1,2,3,6]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum = 6.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= rods.length <= 20
# 	1 <= rods[i] <= 1000
# 	sum(rods[i]) <= 5000

# - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
#   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
#   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
# - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to perform many range queries on a static array, especially when the query operation is associative and idempotent, allowing for O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
#   • Idea: A Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths. It allows O(1) query time for idempotent operations like min/max/gcd and O(log N) for non-idempotent associative operations, after an O(N log N) build time.
#   • Invariants: After precomputation, dp[k][i] stores the result for the range [i, i + 2^k - 1].; For any k > 0, dp[k][i] is the result of combining dp[k-1][i] and dp[k-1][i + 2^(k-1)].
#   • Tips: Precompute log2 values for faster range length calculations.; Store dp[k][i] as the result for range [i, i + 2^k - 1].
#   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to array elements efficiently.; Requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.
# - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
#   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
#   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
