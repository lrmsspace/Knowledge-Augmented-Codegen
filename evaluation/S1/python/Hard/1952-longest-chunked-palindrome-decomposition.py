#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a string text. You should split it to k substrings (subtext1, subtext2, ..., subtextk) such that:
#
#
# 	subtexti is a non-empty string.
# 	The concatenation of all the substrings is equal to text (i.e., subtext1 + subtext2 + ... + subtextk == text).
# 	subtexti == subtextk - i + 1 for all valid values of i (i.e., 1 <= i <= k).
#
#
# Return the largest possible value of k.
#
# Example:
# Input: text = "ghiabcdefhelloadamhelloabcdefghi"
# Output: 7
# Explanation: We can split the string on "(ghi)(abcdef)(hello)(adam)(hello)(abcdef)(ghi)".
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= text.length <= 1000
# 	text consists only of lowercase English characters.

# - String Hashing (string, number, hashing, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare strings, find duplicate strings, or perform fast substring searches and pattern matching in O(1) time after initial O(N) preprocessing.
#   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to a numerical value using a polynomial function, enabling O(1) comparison of strings or substrings after O(N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: prefix_hash[i] stores the polynomial hash of the substring s[0...i-1].; p_power[k] stores p^k mod m for efficient calculation.
#   • Tips: Use two different hash functions with distinct prime `p` and `m` values to minimize collision probability.; Precompute powers of `p` and prefix hashes to enable O(1) substring hash calculation.
#   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions can lead to incorrect results; always consider their possibility.; Integer overflow if modulo operations are not applied correctly at each step of calculation.
# - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
#   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
#   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
# - Suffix Array (string, array, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query properties of all suffixes or substrings of a given text, especially for pattern matching or finding repeated structures. It is particularly useful for problems requiring lexicographical ordering of all suffixes.
#   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing their starting indices. It enables efficient string operations like pattern searching and finding longest common prefixes, typically constructed in O(N log N) time.
#   • Invariants: After k iterations, suffixes are sorted correctly up to a certain length (e.g., 2^k).; All suffixes of the original string are represented by their starting indices in the array.
#   • Tips: Append a unique sentinel character (e.g., '$') smaller than any other character to the string.; Utilize the LCP array, often built alongside, for advanced string queries and optimizations.
#   • Pitfalls: Naive sorting of suffixes by string comparison leads to an inefficient O(N^2 log N) complexity.; High memory usage for very long strings due to storing all suffixes implicitly or explicitly.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
