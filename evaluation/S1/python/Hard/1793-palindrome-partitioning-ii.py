# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
#
# Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "aab"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 2000
# 	s consists of lowercase English letters only.

# - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
#   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
#   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
# - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
#   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
#   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
#   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
#   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
# - Range Minimum Query (array, sparse-table)
#   • When to use: When performing many range minimum queries on a static array, especially when query time needs to be logarithmic after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes minimums for all possible ranges of power-of-two lengths, allowing O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing. It efficiently answers range minimum queries on an immutable array.
#   • Invariants: For any `j`, `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum value in the segment starting at `i` with length `2^j`.; The `log_table[k]` stores `floor(log2(k))` for efficient length calculation.
#   • Tips: Precompute log values or use `std::log2` for efficient length calculations.; The `dp[i][j]` entry stores the minimum in the range `[i, i + 2^j - 1]`.
#   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to the array elements; it's for static data only.; Higher memory consumption compared to some other range query structures.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
