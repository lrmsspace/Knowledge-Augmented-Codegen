#
# Problem Description:
# Given an integer array nums, return the number of AND triples.
#
# An AND triple is a triple of indices (i, j, k) such that:
#
#
# 	0 <= i < nums.length
# 	0 <= j < nums.length
# 	0 <= k < nums.length
# 	nums[i] & nums[j] & nums[k] == 0, where & represents the bitwise-AND operator.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,1,3]
# Output: 12
# Explanation: We could choose the following i, j, k triples:
# (i=0, j=0, k=1) : 2 & 2 & 1
# (i=0, j=1, k=0) : 2 & 1 & 2
# (i=0, j=1, k=1) : 2 & 1 & 1
# (i=0, j=1, k=2) : 2 & 1 & 3
# (i=0, j=2, k=1) : 2 & 3 & 1
# (i=1, j=0, k=0) : 1 & 2 & 2
# (i=1, j=0, k=1) : 1 & 2 & 1
# (i=1, j=0, k=2) : 1 & 2 & 3
# (i=1, j=1, k=0) : 1 & 1 & 2
# (i=1, j=2, k=0) : 1 & 3 & 2
# (i=2, j=0, k=1) : 3 & 2 & 1
# (i=2, j=1, k=0) : 3 & 1 & 2
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
# 	0 <= nums[i] < 216

# - Submask Enumeration
#  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
#   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
#   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
#   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
#   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
#   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
# - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to perform many range queries on a static array, especially when the query operation is associative and idempotent, allowing for O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
#   • Idea: A Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths. It allows O(1) query time for idempotent operations like min/max/gcd and O(log N) for non-idempotent associative operations, after an O(N log N) build time.
#   • Invariants: After precomputation, dp[k][i] stores the result for the range [i, i + 2^k - 1].; For any k > 0, dp[k][i] is the result of combining dp[k-1][i] and dp[k-1][i + 2^(k-1)].
#   • Tips: Precompute log2 values for faster range length calculations.; Store dp[k][i] as the result for range [i, i + 2^k - 1].
#   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to array elements efficiently.; Requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
