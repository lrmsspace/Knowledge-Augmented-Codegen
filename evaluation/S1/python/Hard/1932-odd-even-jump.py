# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-jump/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array arr. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.
#
# You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:
#
#
# 	During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
# 	During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
# 	It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.
#
#
# A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).
#
# Return the number of good starting indices.
#
# Example:
# Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.
# From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.
# From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
# From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
# In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
# jumps.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104
# 	0 <= arr[i] < 105

# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
#   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
#   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
# - Finding the Eulerian path in O(M) (graph, enumeration, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use when the problem requires visiting every edge in a graph exactly once, either starting and ending at the same vertex (cycle) or at two different vertices (path).
#   • Idea: An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. An Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian path that starts and ends on the same vertex.
#   • Invariants: Every edge in the graph is considered exactly once for inclusion in the path.; The current path segment always forms a valid trail in the graph.
#   • Tips: Check vertex degrees to determine path/cycle existence before attempting to find it.; For an Eulerian path, start traversal from one of the two odd-degree vertices.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling multi-edges or self-loops can lead to errors in degree calculation or traversal.; Failing to check graph connectivity can result in incomplete paths or infinite loops.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
