# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-convert-string-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English characters. You are also given two 0-indexed string arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of converting the string original[i] to the string changed[i].
#
# You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a substring x from the string, and change it to y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y. You are allowed to do any number of operations, but any pair of operations must satisfy either of these two conditions:
#
#
# 	The substrings picked in the operations are source[a..b] and source[c..d] with either b < c or d < a. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are disjoint.
# 	The substrings picked in the operations are source[a..b] and source[c..d] with a == c and b == d. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are identical.
#
#
# Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.
#
# Note that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].
#
# Example:
# Input: source = "abcd", target = "acbe", original = ["a","b","c","c","e","d"], changed = ["b","c","b","e","b","e"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]
# Output: 28
# Explanation: To convert "abcd" to "acbe", do the following operations:
# - Change substring source[1..1] from "b" to "c" at a cost of 5.
# - Change substring source[2..2] from "c" to "e" at a cost of 1.
# - Change substring source[2..2] from "e" to "b" at a cost of 2.
# - Change substring source[3..3] from "d" to "e" at a cost of 20.
# The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28. 
# It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= source.length == target.length <= 1000
# 	source, target consist only of lowercase English characters.
# 	1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 100
# 	1 <= original[i].length == changed[i].length <= source.length
# 	original[i], changed[i] consist only of lowercase English characters.
# 	original[i] != changed[i]
# 	1 <= cost[i] <= 106

# - String Hashing (string, number, hashing)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare strings or substrings, especially in scenarios involving large texts or numerous comparisons. It's also useful for pattern matching and detecting duplicates in collections of strings.
#   • Idea: String hashing converts a string into a numerical value (hash) to enable fast comparisons and lookups. This technique typically uses polynomial hashing with a base and a modulus, offering O(L) for initial hash computation and O(1) for substring hashes after O(N) precomputation.
#   • Invariants: The hash of a string S of length L is (S[0]*P^(L-1) + S[1]*P^(L-2) + ... + S[L-1]*P^0) % M.; For any substring S[i...j], its hash can be derived from precomputed prefix hashes in O(1) time.
#   • Tips: Use multiple hash functions with different bases and moduli to reduce collision probability.; Choose a large prime modulus (e.g., 10^9 + 7) and a random base for robustness.
#   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions are possible; always verify equality for critical applications or use multiple hashes.; Choosing a small or non-prime modulus significantly increases the risk of collisions.
# - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, sparse-table, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: When you need O(1) query time for any associative operation (like sum, min, max, GCD) on a static array, after an O(N log N) preprocessing step.
#   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that supports O(1) range queries for any associative operation on a static array. It achieves this by precomputing results for specific disjoint and overlapping ranges, with an O(N log N) construction time and space complexity.
#   • Invariants: table[k][i] stores the result of the operation for a range of length 2^k starting at index i.; For any query [L, R], the result is obtained by combining two precomputed values from blocks that cover [L, mid] and [mid+1, R].
#   • Tips: Understand the block decomposition based on powers of two for construction.; Queries combine results from two precomputed blocks that cover the query range.
#   • Pitfalls: Does not support point updates efficiently; any modification requires a full rebuild.; Higher space complexity of O(N log N) compared to some other range query structures.
# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
#   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
#   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
