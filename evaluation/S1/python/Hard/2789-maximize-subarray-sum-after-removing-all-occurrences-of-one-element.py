# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-subarray-sum-after-removing-all-occurrences-of-one-element/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array nums.
#
# You can do the following operation on the array at most once:
#
#
# 	Choose any integer x such that nums remains non-empty on removing all occurrences of x.
# 	Remove all occurrences of x from the array.
#
#
# Return the maximum subarray sum across all possible resulting arrays.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [-3,2,-2,-1,3,-2,3]
#
# Output: 7
#
# Explanation:
#
# We can have the following arrays after at most one operation:
#
#
# 	The original array is nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
# 	Deleting all occurences of x = -3 results in nums = [2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
# 	Deleting all occurences of x = -2 results in nums = [-3, 2, -1, 3, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 2 + (-1) + 3 + 3 = 7.
# 	Deleting all occurences of x = -1 results in nums = [-3, 2, -2, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
# 	Deleting all occurences of x = 3 results in nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, -2]. The maximum subarray sum is 2.
#
#
# The output is max(4, 4, 7, 4, 2) = 7.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	-106 <= nums[i] <= 106

# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
#   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
# - Submask Enumeration
#  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
#   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
#   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
#   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
#   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
#   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
