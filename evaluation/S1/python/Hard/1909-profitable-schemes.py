# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/profitable-schemes/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# There is a group of n members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The ith crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.
#
# Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least minProfit profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most n.
#
# Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 5, minProfit = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
# In total, there are 2 schemes.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 100
# 	0 <= minProfit <= 100
# 	1 <= group.length <= 100
# 	1 <= group[i] <= 100
# 	profit.length == group.length
# 	0 <= profit[i] <= 100

# - Counting labeled graphs (number, dp-2d, counting, recursion)
#   • When to use: When counting the total number of labeled graphs with a specific number of vertices and connected components. Useful for problems requiring enumeration of graph structures based on their connectivity properties.
#   • Idea: This technique uses dynamic programming to count labeled graphs with a given number of vertices and connected components by building up solutions from smaller subproblems. It leverages a recurrence relation that considers the component containing a specific vertex, leading to an O(N^2 * K) time complexity for N vertices and K components.
#   • Invariants: D[i][j] correctly stores the number of labeled graphs with i vertices and j components.; All C_s values for s < n are correctly precomputed before calculating D[n][k].
#   • Tips: Precompute binomial coefficients for efficiency.; Precompute the number of connected graphs (C_s) for all relevant s.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for the dynamic programming table.; Off-by-one errors in binomial coefficient calculations or array indexing.
# - Binomial Coefficients (array, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to compute many binomial coefficients, especially for values up to a certain N, or when working with modulo arithmetic where division is not straightforward.
#   • Idea: This method computes binomial coefficients using Pascal's identity, building a 2D DP table where C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k). It has a time complexity of O(N^2) for computing all coefficients up to N.
#   • Invariants: For each cell dp[i][j], it stores the value of C(i, j).; At the start of computing row i, all values for row i-1 are correctly calculated and available.
#   • Tips: Optimize space by storing only the current and previous row of the DP table.; For O(1) lookup after precomputation, calculate all factorials and inverse factorials modulo a prime.
#   • Pitfalls: Direct division for C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) is problematic with modulo arithmetic unless the modulo is prime.; Integer overflow can occur for large N and K if not handled with appropriate data types or modulo operations.
# - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: Use when selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and value, to maximize total value without exceeding a given capacity. It is applicable for resource allocation problems with discrete choices.
#   • Idea: The Knapsack Problem aims to choose items with maximum total value such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It is typically solved using dynamic programming, achieving a time complexity of O(nW) for n items and capacity W.
#   • Invariants: `dp[j]` (in 1D DP) represents the maximum value achievable with capacity `j` using items considered so far.; When processing item `i` and capacity `j` (decreasing `j`), `dp[j-weight_i]` holds the value from previous items for that reduced capacity.
#   • Tips: Initialize DP table with zeros for capacity 0 and unreachable states.; For 0-1 knapsack with 1D DP, iterate capacity `j` in decreasing order.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrect iteration order for 1D DP in 0-1 knapsack (using increasing `j`).; Off-by-one errors in item indices or capacity calculations.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
