# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-obstacle-removal-to-reach-corner/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n. Each cell has one of two values:
#
#
# 	0 represents an empty cell,
# 	1 represents an obstacle that may be removed.
#
#
# You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell.
#
# Return the minimum number of obstacles to remove so you can move from the upper left corner (0, 0) to the lower right corner (m - 1, n - 1).
#
# Example:
# Input: grid = [[0,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We can remove the obstacles at (0, 1) and (0, 2) to create a path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
# It can be shown that we need to remove at least 2 obstacles, so we return 2.
# Note that there may be other ways to remove 2 obstacles to create a path.
#
# Constraints:
# m == grid.length
# 	n == grid[i].length
# 	1 <= m, n <= 105
# 	2 <= m * n <= 105
# 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
# 	grid[0][0] == grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 0

# - 0-1 BFS (graph, deque, 01-bfs, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently computes single-source shortest paths, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
#   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds the single-source shortest paths in a graph where all edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1. It uses a deque to process nodes, achieving an optimal time complexity of O(V + E).
#   • Invariants: When a node 'u' is extracted from the front of the deque, 'dist[u]' is its shortest path from the source.; The deque always contains nodes whose distances are either 'D' or 'D+1', where 'D' is the distance of the last node extracted.
#   • Tips: Always push 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Push 1-weight edges to the back of the deque.
#   • Pitfalls: Pushing 0-weight edges to the back or 1-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Not correctly initializing distances or the source node.
# - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
#   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
#   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
#   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
#   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
#   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
# - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
#   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
#   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
#   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
#   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
