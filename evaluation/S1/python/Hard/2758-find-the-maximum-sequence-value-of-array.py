# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-sequence-value-of-array/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array nums and a positive integer k.
#
# The value of a sequence seq of size 2 * x is defined as:
#
#
# 	(seq[0] OR seq[1] OR ... OR seq[x - 1]) XOR (seq[x] OR seq[x + 1] OR ... OR seq[2 * x - 1]).
#
#
# Return the maximum value of any subsequence of nums having size 2 * k.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,6,7], k = 1
#
# Output: 5
#
# Explanation:
#
# The subsequence [2, 7] has the maximum value of 2 XOR 7 = 5.
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= nums.length <= 400
# 	1 <= nums[i] < 27
# 	1 <= k <= nums.length / 2

# - Submask Enumeration
#  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
#   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
#   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
#   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
#   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
# - Suffix Array (string, array, counting-sort, radix-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently query or analyze all suffixes of a string, often for pattern matching, string searching, or finding repeated substrings. It provides a sorted order of all suffixes.
#   • Idea: The Suffix Array algorithm constructs an array containing the starting indices of all suffixes of a string, sorted lexicographically. It typically uses a doubling strategy with counting sort or radix sort in each step, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: After iteration k, p contains the sorted indices of all cyclic substrings of length 2^k.; After iteration k, c[i] represents the equivalence class of the cyclic substring starting at i with length 2^k.
#   • Tips: Append a unique, smallest character (e.g., '$') to the string to handle suffixes as cyclic shifts.; Utilize counting sort for efficient sorting of characters and pairs of equivalence classes.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the sentinel character can lead to incorrect suffix order or out-of-bounds access.; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices for cyclic shifts or substring lengths.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
