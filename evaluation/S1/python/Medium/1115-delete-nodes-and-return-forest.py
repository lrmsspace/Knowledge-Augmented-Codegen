# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.
#
# After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).
#
# Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
# Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
# 	Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
# 	to_delete.length <= 1000
# 	to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.

# - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
#   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
#   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
#   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
#   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Hash Tables (array, number, string, hashing)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently by transforming keys into array indices, managing potential collisions.
#   • Idea: Hash tables map keys to array indices using a hash function, enabling average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups by efficiently managing potential collisions.
#   • Invariants: The hash function always produces an index within the valid array bounds [0, M-1].; For any two equal keys, their hash values remain identical.
#   • Tips: Design hash functions for uniform key distribution across the array.; Ensure hash functions are deterministic and efficient to compute.
#   • Pitfalls: Using a hash function that does not uniformly distribute keys, leading to many collisions.; Failing to implement a proper collision resolution strategy.
# - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
#   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
#   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.

# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
