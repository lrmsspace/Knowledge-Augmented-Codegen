#
# Problem Description:
# A critical point in a linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima.
#
# A node is a local maxima if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.
#
# A node is a local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.
#
# Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists both a previous node and a next node.
#
# Given a linked list head, return an array of length 2 containing [minDistance, maxDistance] where minDistance is the minimum distance between any two distinct critical points and maxDistance is the maximum distance between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return [-1, -1].
#
# Example:
# Input: head = [3,1]
# Output: [-1,-1]
# Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [2, 105].
# 	1 <= Node.val <= 105

# - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure is required, and dynamic size with efficient O(1) push and pop operations is crucial, especially without a fixed capacity.
#   • Idea: This describes implementing a stack using a singly linked list, where elements are added and removed from the head of the list. Both push and pop operations achieve O(1) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The 'first' pointer always points to the top element of the stack, or is null if the stack is empty.; Each node's 'next' pointer correctly links to the subsequent element in the stack, maintaining the LIFO order.
#   • Tips: Maintain a 'first' pointer to the head of the linked list, representing the stack's top.; Push operation involves creating a new node, linking it to the current 'first', then updating 'first'.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case for pop, leading to `NoSuchElementException`.; Incorrectly updating the 'first' pointer during push or pop, which can break the list structure.
# - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
#   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
#   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
#   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
# - Simulated Annealing (array, number, randomized, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when seeking a near-optimal solution for complex optimization problems with many local optima, especially when exact solutions are computationally infeasible or too slow.
#   • Idea: Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic metaheuristic for global optimization, inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It explores the search space by accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time, aiming to escape local optima.
#   • Invariants: The `s_best` state always represents the lowest energy found across all iterations so far.; The temperature `T` is always non-negative and decreases monotonically with each iteration.
#   • Tips: Start with a sufficiently high initial temperature to allow broad exploration.; Choose a slow cooling schedule (decay rate) for better solution quality, at the cost of longer runtime.
#   • Pitfalls: Getting stuck in local minima if the cooling schedule is too fast.; Excessive runtime if the cooling schedule is too slow or initial temperature is too high.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
