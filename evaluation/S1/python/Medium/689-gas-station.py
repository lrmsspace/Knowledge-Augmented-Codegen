#
# Problem Description:
# There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].
#
# You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
#
# Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
#
# Example:
# Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
# Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
# Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
# Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
# Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
# Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
# Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
#
# Constraints:
# n == gas.length == cost.length
# 	1 <= n <= 105
# 	0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104
# 	The input is generated such that the answer is unique.

# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Simulated Annealing (array, number, randomized, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when seeking a near-optimal solution for complex optimization problems with many local optima, especially when exact solutions are computationally infeasible or too slow.
#   • Idea: Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic metaheuristic for global optimization, inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It explores the search space by accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time, aiming to escape local optima.
#   • Invariants: The `s_best` state always represents the lowest energy found across all iterations so far.; The temperature `T` is always non-negative and decreases monotonically with each iteration.
#   • Tips: Start with a sufficiently high initial temperature to allow broad exploration.; Choose a slow cooling schedule (decay rate) for better solution quality, at the cost of longer runtime.
#   • Pitfalls: Getting stuck in local minima if the cooling schedule is too fast.; Excessive runtime if the cooling schedule is too slow or initial temperature is too high.
# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
#   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
#   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
#   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
