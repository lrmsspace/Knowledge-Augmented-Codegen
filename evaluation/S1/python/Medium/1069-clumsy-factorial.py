#
# Problem Description:
# The factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
#
#
# 	For example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.
#
#
# We make a clumsy factorial using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply '*', divide '/', add '+', and subtract '-' in this order.
#
#
# 	For example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1.
#
#
# However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic. We do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.
#
# Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 10 * 9 / 8 = 90 / 8 = 11.
#
# Given an integer n, return the clumsy factorial of n.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 4
# Output: 7
# Explanation: 7 = 4 * 3 / 2 + 1
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 104

# - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to evaluate an arithmetic expression given in infix notation, respecting operator precedence and parentheses. It is suitable for expressions with binary, left-associative operators.
#   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an infix arithmetic expression using two stacks: one for operands and one for operators. It processes the expression from left to right, applying operator precedence and associativity rules to achieve an O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The operand stack always contains valid numerical values or intermediate results.; The operator stack maintains operators such that operators with higher or equal precedence are processed before lower precedence ones.
#   • Tips: Clearly define operator precedence and associativity rules for all operators.; Use a separate stack for operands (numbers) and operators (including parentheses).
#   • Pitfalls: Misinterpreting operator precedence or associativity rules can lead to incorrect results.; Failure to handle mismatched or unbalanced parentheses can cause runtime errors.
# - Factorial modulo 
# p (number, array, recursion, mod-exp, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when computing powers of numbers modulo another number, especially with very large exponents, to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.
#   • Idea: Modular exponentiation computes the remainder of a large positive integer power divided by another positive integer. It runs in O(log exponent) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The current result `res` accumulates the product of `base` terms modulo `modulus`.; The `exponent` variable always represents the remaining power to be applied.
#   • Tips: Use binary exponentiation (exponentiation by squaring) for efficiency.; Handle base, exponent, and modulus carefully for edge cases like zero or one.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to apply modulo at each step, leading to overflow.; Incorrectly handling negative exponents (if applicable, though usually positive).
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
