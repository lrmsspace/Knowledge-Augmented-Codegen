# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array nums of length n where nums is a permutation of the numbers in the range [0, n - 1].
#
# You should build a set s[k] = {nums[k], nums[nums[k]], nums[nums[nums[k]]], ... } subjected to the following rule:
#
#
# 	The first element in s[k] starts with the selection of the element nums[k] of index = k.
# 	The next element in s[k] should be nums[nums[k]], and then nums[nums[nums[k]]], and so on.
# 	We stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in s[k].
#
#
# Return the longest length of a set s[k].
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [5,4,0,3,1,6,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 
# nums[0] = 5, nums[1] = 4, nums[2] = 0, nums[3] = 3, nums[4] = 1, nums[5] = 6, nums[6] = 2.
# One of the longest sets s[k]:
# s[0] = {nums[0], nums[5], nums[6], nums[2]} = {5, 6, 2, 0}
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	0 <= nums[i] < nums.length
# 	All the values of nums are unique.

# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Finding the Eulerian path in O(M) (graph, enumeration, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use when the problem requires visiting every edge in a graph exactly once, either starting and ending at the same vertex (cycle) or at two different vertices (path).
#   • Idea: An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. An Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian path that starts and ends on the same vertex.
#   • Invariants: Every edge in the graph is considered exactly once for inclusion in the path.; The current path segment always forms a valid trail in the graph.
#   • Tips: Check vertex degrees to determine path/cycle existence before attempting to find it.; For an Eulerian path, start traversal from one of the two odd-degree vertices.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling multi-edges or self-loops can lead to errors in degree calculation or traversal.; Failing to check graph connectivity can result in incomplete paths or infinite loops.
# - Burnside's lemma / Pólya enumeration theorem (array, number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting the number of distinct configurations or arrangements of objects under a set of symmetry operations, where configurations are considered identical if one can be transformed into another by a group action.
#   • Idea: Burnside's Lemma and Pólya Enumeration Theorem are combinatorial tools used to count the number of distinct objects under a group of symmetries. Both typically involve iterating through group elements and analyzing permutation cycle structures, often resulting in polynomial time complexity depending on group size and element analysis.
#   • Invariants: The set of group elements considered remains consistent throughout the summation.; Each group element's cycle decomposition is correctly identified.
#   • Tips: Identify the group of symmetry operations acting on the objects.; For each group element, determine its permutation cycle structure.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the full set of distinct group operations.; Errors in determining the cycle structure of permutations.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
