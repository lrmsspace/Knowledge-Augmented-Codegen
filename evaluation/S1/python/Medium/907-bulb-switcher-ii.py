# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# There is a room with n bulbs labeled from 1 to n that all are turned on initially, and four buttons on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:
#
#
# 	Button 1: Flips the status of all the bulbs.
# 	Button 2: Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., 2, 4, ...).
# 	Button 3: Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., 1, 3, ...).
# 	Button 4: Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label j = 3k + 1 where k = 0, 1, 2, ... (i.e., 1, 4, 7, 10, ...).
#
#
# You must make exactly presses button presses in total. For each press, you may pick any of the four buttons to press.
#
# Given the two integers n and presses, return the number of different possible statuses after performing all presses button presses.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 1, presses = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Status can be:
# - [off] by pressing button 1
# - [on] by pressing button 2
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 1000
# 	0 <= presses <= 1000

# - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, enumeration)
#   • When to use: When all subsets of a fixed size K need to be generated, either in lexicographical order or such that successive combinations differ by exactly one element.
#   • Idea: This algorithm enumerates all K-combinations from a set, either in lexicographical order or using a Gray code approach where adjacent combinations differ by a single element. It typically runs in O(N choose K) time, generating each combination in O(K) or O(1) amortized time.
#   • Invariants: Each generated combination contains exactly K distinct elements.; All elements within a combination are unique and from the original set.
#   • Tips: For lexicographical generation, find the rightmost element that can be incremented without exceeding its maximum possible value.; After incrementing an element, set all subsequent elements to their minimum valid values.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions for the rightmost element or its maximum value.; Off-by-one errors when assigning subsequent elements after an increment.
# - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (queue, stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query the minimum element of a stack or queue in O(1) average time. Also applicable for finding minimums in all fixed-length subarrays using a sliding window.
#   • Idea: This technique augments a stack or queue to support O(1) average time retrieval of its minimum element, typically by storing minimums alongside data or using auxiliary structures. It achieves amortized constant time for all operations.
#   • Invariants: For a minimum stack, the auxiliary minimum stack's top element is always the minimum of all elements currently in the main stack.; For a minimum queue implemented with two stacks, the output stack is only refilled from the input stack when the output stack becomes empty.
#   • Tips: For a minimum stack, use an auxiliary stack to store minimums encountered so far.; Only push to the auxiliary minimum stack if the new element is less than or equal to its current top.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to pop from the auxiliary minimum stack when the main stack's top is removed.; Incorrectly handling the transfer logic between the two stacks for a minimum queue.
# - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
#   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
#   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
#   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
#   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
