# Problem Description:
# Given a 2D integer array nums, return all elements of nums in diagonal order as shown in the below images.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: [1,4,2,7,5,3,8,6,9]
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	1 <= nums[i].length <= 105
# 	1 <= sum(nums[i].length) <= 105
# 	1 <= nums[i][j] <= 105

# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Catalan Numbers (number, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when counting arrangements of objects that follow a specific non-crossing or balancing rule, often involving recursive decomposition or paths constrained by a diagonal.
#   • Idea: Catalan numbers count the number of ways to arrange certain combinatorial objects, such as balanced parentheses sequences or monotonic paths that do not cross a diagonal. They can be computed using a recurrence relation (O(N^2) with DP) or a direct binomial coefficient formula (O(N) or O(N log N)).
#   • Invariants: dp[i] stores the i-th Catalan number, correctly computed from dp[0] through dp[i-1].; For each n, the sum sum(dp[k] * dp[n-1-k]) iterates through all valid partitions of the problem.
#   • Tips: Memoize the recursive solution to avoid redundant computations, transforming it into dynamic programming.; For large N, use modular arithmetic if results are required modulo a prime to prevent integer overflow.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to correctly handle the base cases, typically C0 = 1 and C1 = 1.; Encountering integer overflow when calculating large binomial coefficients without appropriate modular arithmetic.
# - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
#   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
#   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
