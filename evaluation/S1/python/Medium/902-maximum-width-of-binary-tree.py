# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.
#
# The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.
#
# The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.
#
# It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].
# 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

# - Breadth-first search (graph, array, bfs, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or traversing a graph level by level to explore all reachable nodes. It is also suitable for finding connected components or checking reachability.
#   • Idea: Breadth-first search explores a graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in terms of edges from a source node to all other reachable nodes. It typically runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
#   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or next level of traversal from the source.; All nodes already dequeued have been fully processed, and their unvisited neighbors have been enqueued.
#   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit in a FIFO manner.; Mark nodes as visited immediately upon adding them to the queue to prevent redundant processing and cycles.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs or incorrect path lengths.; Not handling disconnected components if the goal is to traverse the entire graph.
# - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, stack, simulation, monotonic-stack)
#   • When to use: This technique is used to answer Range Minimum Queries efficiently on a static array by transforming them into Lowest Common Ancestor queries on a Cartesian Tree.
#   • Idea: This approach solves Range Minimum Query problems by constructing a Cartesian Tree from the input array, where the root of any subtree is its minimum element. RMQ for a given range then reduces to finding the Lowest Common Ancestor of the range's endpoints in this tree, allowing O(N) construction and O(1) query time after O(N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian Tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the subtree rooted at `u`.; For any node `u`, all nodes in its left subtree have indices smaller than `index(u)`, and all nodes in its right subtree have indices larger than `index(u)`.
#   • Tips: A Cartesian Tree is a binary tree where each node's value is less than its children's values, and an in-order traversal yields the original array.; Utilize a monotonic stack to construct the Cartesian Tree in linear O(N) time.
#   • Pitfalls: Correctly implementing the monotonic stack for Cartesian Tree construction can be challenging.; Edge cases, such as an empty stack or handling the last elements during tree building, must be managed carefully.
# - Balanced Search Trees (tree, ds, binary-search, recursion)
#   • When to use: When you need to store a dynamic set of ordered data and require guaranteed logarithmic time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations, even in worst-case scenarios.
#   • Idea: Balanced search trees are a class of self-balancing binary search trees that maintain a logarithmic height to ensure O(log N) time complexity for core operations like search, insertion, and deletion. They achieve this balance through structural modifications such as rotations or node splitting/merging.
#   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are less than its key(s), and all keys in its right subtree are greater than its key(s).; The height of the tree is always proportional to log N, ensuring O(log N) operations.
#   • Tips: Understand the specific balancing rules (e.g., AVL rotations, Red-Black tree color properties, 2-3 tree node splits).; Consider the trade-offs between different balanced tree types (e.g., simpler implementation vs. stricter balance).
#   • Pitfalls: Implementation complexity can be high due to intricate rebalancing logic.; Overhead for rebalancing operations might be noticeable for very small N.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
