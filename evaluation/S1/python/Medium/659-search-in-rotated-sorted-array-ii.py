# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).
#
# Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].
#
# Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.
#
# You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: true
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
# 	-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# 	nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
# 	-104 <= target <= 104
#
#

# Follow up: This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
#   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
#   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
#   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
#   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
# - Check if point belongs to the convex pol (geometry, array, binary-search)
#   • When to use: This algorithm is used to efficiently determine if a given query point lies inside or on the boundary of a convex polygon, especially when many queries are performed on the same polygon.
#   • Idea: The core idea is to decompose the convex polygon into triangles originating from a reference vertex. Binary search is then used to find the specific triangle that could contain the query point, followed by a point-in-triangle check.
#   • Invariants: The reference point p_0 is the lexicographically smallest vertex of the polygon.; All polygon vertices p_1, ..., p_n are ordered counter-clockwise by polar angle around p_0.
#   • Tips: Choose a consistent reference point, typically the lexicographically smallest vertex, to simplify angular sorting.; Ensure polygon vertices are ordered (e.g., counter-clockwise) relative to the reference point for correct binary search behavior.
#   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision errors can lead to incorrect results for collinear points or boundary checks; prefer integer arithmetic with cross products.; Incorrectly handling boundary conditions (points exactly on an edge or vertex) can lead to false negatives or positives.

# Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, quickselect, randomized)
#   • When to use: When you need to efficiently find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array. It is ideal when a full sort is unnecessary and average linear time performance is acceptable.
#   • Idea: Quickselect is a selection algorithm that finds the Kth smallest element in an unsorted list by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It achieves an average time complexity of O(N) and a worst-case complexity of O(N^2).
#   • Invariants: All elements in the left partition are less than or equal to the pivot element.; All elements in the right partition are greater than or equal to the pivot element.
#   • Tips: Shuffle the input array or choose a random pivot to achieve average O(N) performance.; The algorithm modifies the input array in place, so a copy might be needed if the original must be preserved.
#   • Pitfalls: A consistently bad pivot choice (e.g., always smallest/largest) leads to O(N^2) worst-case time.; Not suitable if the relative order of other elements needs to be preserved (it's not a stable algorithm).
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
