# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-flips-to-make-binary-grid-palindromic-i/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.
#
# A row or column is considered palindromic if its values read the same forward and backward.
#
# You can flip any number of cells in grid from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0.
#
# Return the minimum number of cells that need to be flipped to make either all rows palindromic or all columns palindromic.
#
# Example:
# Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
#
#
#
# Flipping the highlighted cells makes all the rows palindromic.
#
# Constraints:
# m == grid.length
# 	n == grid[i].length
# 	1 <= m * n <= 2 * 105
# 	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1

# - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
#   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
#   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
#   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).
# - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
#   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
#   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
# - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, simulation, enumeration)
#   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring within a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity for this task.
#   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all maximal palindromic substrings centered at each position in a string by leveraging symmetry and previously computed results. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: d_odd[i] stores the radius of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.; The (l, r) interval always defines the rightmost palindrome found so far.
#   • Tips: Preprocess the string with delimiters to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Maintain the current rightmost boundary `r` of the largest palindrome found.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update the `(l, r)` boundaries after processing each center.; Incorrectly calculating mirror positions or handling boundary cases for `i > r`.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
