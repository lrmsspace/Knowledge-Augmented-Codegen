#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer mass, which represents the original mass of a planet. You are further given an integer array asteroids, where asteroids[i] is the mass of the ith asteroid.
#
# You can arrange for the planet to collide with the asteroids in any arbitrary order. If the mass of the planet is greater than or equal to the mass of the asteroid, the asteroid is destroyed and the planet gains the mass of the asteroid. Otherwise, the planet is destroyed.
#
# Return true if all asteroids can be destroyed. Otherwise, return false.
#
# Example:
# Input: mass = 10, asteroids = [3,9,19,5,21]
# Output: true
# Explanation: One way to order the asteroids is [9,19,5,3,21]:
# - The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 9. New planet mass: 10 + 9 = 19
# - The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 19. New planet mass: 19 + 19 = 38
# - The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 5. New planet mass: 38 + 5 = 43
# - The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 3. New planet mass: 43 + 3 = 46
# - The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 21. New planet mass: 46 + 21 = 67
# All asteroids are destroyed.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= mass <= 105
# 	1 <= asteroids.length <= 105
# 	1 <= asteroids[i] <= 105

# - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: When tasks need to be processed sequentially on a single resource to optimize a cumulative metric like total completion time or weighted sum of completion times.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal sequence for processing jobs on a single machine by applying a greedy strategy, often involving sorting based on specific criteria. It typically achieves an optimal schedule in O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The list of jobs is sorted according to the chosen greedy criterion.; For any prefix of the sorted jobs, the current schedule minimizes the objective function for those jobs.
#   • Tips: Identify the correct sorting key (e.g., processing time, weight/time ratio) for the objective function.; Prove optimality using an exchange argument to justify the greedy choice.
#   • Pitfalls: Applying an incorrect sorting criterion for the specific optimization objective.; Assuming a greedy approach is always optimal without a formal proof.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, bitset, sieve)
#   • When to use: When you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit N, or efficiently check primality for many numbers within that range. It is ideal for precomputing primes.
#   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer N by iteratively marking multiples of each prime. It achieves O(N log log N) time complexity and O(N) space.
#   • Invariants: For any number i less than the current prime p, is_prime[i] correctly reflects its primality.; All multiples of primes smaller than the current prime p have already been marked as composite.
#   • Tips: Optimize by starting marking multiples from p*p for each prime p.; Use a bitset for memory efficiency when N is large.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to explicitly handle 0 and 1 as non-prime.; Incorrectly marking multiples, e.g., starting from 2*p instead of p*p.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
