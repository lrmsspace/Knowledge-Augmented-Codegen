# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-elements-to-add-to-form-a-given-sum/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array nums and two integers limit and goal. The array nums has an interesting property that abs(nums[i]) <= limit.
#
# Return the minimum number of elements you need to add to make the sum of the array equal to goal. The array must maintain its property that abs(nums[i]) <= limit.
#
# Note that abs(x) equals x if x >= 0, and -x otherwise.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,-1,1], limit = 3, goal = -4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You can add -2 and -3, then the sum of the array will be 1 - 1 + 1 - 2 - 3 = -4.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	1 <= limit <= 106
# 	-limit <= nums[i] <= limit
# 	-109 <= goal <= 109

# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
#   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
# - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (array, number, counting, sieve)
#   • When to use: Use when direct counting of elements satisfying specific conditions is difficult due to overlaps, and you need to find the count of elements satisfying at least one, exactly k, or none of several properties.
#   • Idea: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle counts the size of a union of sets by alternately adding and subtracting the sizes of intersections of increasing numbers of sets. Its complexity is often exponential in the number of properties.
#   • Invariants: At the start of processing subsets of size k, the running total correctly accounts for all intersections of size less than k.; For every element x, its contribution to the total sum is 1 if it satisfies the target condition, and 0 otherwise.
#   • Tips: Clearly define the properties (P1, P2, ..., Pn) for which elements are counted.; Systematically calculate the sizes of all relevant intersections of properties.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the properties or the universe of elements being counted.; Errors in calculating the sizes of specific intersections of properties.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
