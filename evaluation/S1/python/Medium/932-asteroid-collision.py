#
# Problem Description:
# We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row. The indices of the asteriod in the array represent their relative position in space.
#
# For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
#
# Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
#
# Example:
# Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
# Output: [5,10]
# Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= asteroids.length <= 104
# 	-1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000
# 	asteroids[i] != 0

# - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need to perform standard stack operations (push, pop) and also query the minimum element currently in the stack, all in constant time.
#   • Idea: Augments a standard stack by storing each element along with the minimum value encountered up to that point in the stack. This allows O(1) retrieval of the current minimum, while push and pop operations also remain O(1).
#   • Invariants: The top element's second component (minimum_so_far) always represents the minimum value currently in the entire stack.; For any element (value, min_so_far) in the stack, min_so_far is the minimum of 'value' and all elements below it.
#   • Tips: Store elements as pairs: (actual_value, minimum_at_this_level).; When pushing, the new minimum_at_this_level is min(new_value, stack.top().second) if stack is not empty, else new_value.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case when calculating the minimum for a new element.; Incorrectly assuming the minimum can be tracked with a single auxiliary variable without considering pops.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Circle-Circle Intersection (geometry, number, simulation, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the common points where two circles intersect on a 2D plane, handling cases from no intersection to infinite points.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection points of two circles by algebraically transforming their equations into a system involving one circle and one line. It typically achieves O(1) time complexity for finding the intersection points.
#   • Invariants: The relative positions and radii of the circles remain unchanged after coordinate translation.; The derived linear equation represents the radical axis of the two circles.
#   • Tips: Translate one circle to the origin to simplify the equations.; Subtract the two circle equations to derive a linear equation (the radical axis).
#   • Pitfalls: Numerical instability due to floating-point arithmetic, especially for tangent cases.; Forgetting to translate the resulting intersection points back to the original coordinate system.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
