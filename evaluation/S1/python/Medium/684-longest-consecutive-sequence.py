#
# Problem Description:
# Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
#
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
#
# Constraints:
# 0 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the longest sequence of elements in a given array such that each element is greater than the preceding one, without changing their relative order. It's applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered subsets.
#   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of an array where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using a greedy approach with binary search, or O(N^2) using dynamic programming.
#   • Invariants: The 'tails' array elements are always in strictly increasing order.; tails[i] stores the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.
#   • Tips: Prefer the O(N log N) greedy approach with binary search for better performance.; The 'tails' array in the greedy approach stores the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of a certain length.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing LIS with Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) or contiguous subarrays.; Incorrectly handling duplicate elements when 'strictly increasing' is required.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Ordered Set - Python (ds, hashing)
#   • When to use: When you need a collection of unique items where the order of insertion must be preserved, allowing for efficient membership testing and iteration in that specific order.
#   • Idea: An ordered set stores unique elements while maintaining their original insertion order. It provides O(1) average time complexity for additions, deletions, and membership checks, typically implemented using a hash table combined with a linked list.
#   • Invariants: Every element within the set is unique.; The sequence of elements during iteration strictly follows their initial insertion order.
#   • Tips: In Python 3.7+, standard `dict`s maintain insertion order, effectively serving as ordered sets.; Use `collections.OrderedDict` for older Python versions or explicit semantic clarity.
#   • Pitfalls: Order is based on insertion, not value-based sorting; do not confuse the two.; Modifying an element's hash value while it's in the set can lead to undefined behavior.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
