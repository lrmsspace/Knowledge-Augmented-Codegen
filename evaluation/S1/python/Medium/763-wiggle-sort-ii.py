# Problem Description:
# Given an integer array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....
#
# You may assume the input array always has a valid answer.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,5,1,1,6,4]
# Output: [1,6,1,5,1,4]
# Explanation: [1,4,1,5,1,6] is also accepted.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
# 	0 <= nums[i] <= 5000
# 	It is guaranteed that there will be an answer for the given input nums.

# Follow Up: Can you do it in O(n) time and/or in-place with O(1) extra space?

# Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, quickselect)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without fully sorting the entire data structure. It's particularly useful for large datasets where a full sort is too slow.
#   • Idea: Quickselect is a selection algorithm that finds the Kth smallest element in an unsorted list. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach similar to Quicksort, but only recurses on one side, achieving an average time complexity of O(N).
#   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to the pivot's value.; All elements to the right of the pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot's value.
#   • Tips: Choose a good pivot strategy, such as a random pivot, to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; Handle duplicate elements carefully during the partitioning step to ensure correctness.
#   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Deep recursion without tail call optimization can cause stack overflow errors.
# - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
#   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
#   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
# - Range Minimum Query (array, tree, divide-and-conquer)
#   • When to use: When needing to find the minimum (or maximum) value within various specified ranges of an array efficiently. Suitable for scenarios with many queries on a fixed or frequently updated dataset.
#   • Idea: This technique precomputes answers for subproblems, typically by building a tree-like structure or a table, to efficiently answer queries for the minimum (or maximum) value within a given range. It achieves O(log N) or O(1) query time after O(N log N) or O(N) preprocessing, depending on the specific data structure used.
#   • Invariants: For a Segment Tree node covering range [L, R], its value stores the minimum of all elements in the original array from index L to R.; For any query range [Q_L, Q_R], the combined result from relevant tree nodes correctly represents the minimum in [Q_L, Q_R].
#   • Tips: For static arrays, Sparse Table offers O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.; For dynamic arrays with updates, Segment Tree offers O(log N) query and update time after O(N) preprocessing.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when defining range boundaries or calculating indices.; Incorrect merge logic for segment tree nodes (e.g., using sum instead of min).
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
