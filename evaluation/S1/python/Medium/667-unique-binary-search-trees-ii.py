# Problem Description:
# Given an integer n, return all the structurally unique BST's (binary search trees), which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n. Return the answer in any order.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 3
# Output: [[1,null,2,null,3],[1,null,3,2],[2,1,3],[3,1,null,null,2],[3,2,null,1]]
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 8

# - Introduction to Dynamic Programming (array, tree, recursion, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, and a natural recursive solution is inefficient due to redundant computations. It's ideal for transforming exponential recursive solutions into polynomial time.
#   • Idea: Top-down dynamic programming, or memoization, optimizes recursive solutions by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This technique typically reduces time complexity from exponential to polynomial, often O(N) or O(N*M).
#   • Invariants: memo[state] contains the computed result for 'state' if memo[state] is not the sentinel value.; If memo[state] is the sentinel value, the result for 'state' has not yet been computed.
#   • Tips: Initialize the memoization table with a sentinel value (e.g., -1, null) to distinguish uncomputed states from valid zero/false results.; Use arrays for lookup tables when the state space is contiguous and small for optimal cache performance.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the memoization table, leading to incorrect results or infinite loops.; Incorrectly identifying or handling base cases in the recursive function.
# - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, recursion, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when an exhaustive list of all subsets of a specific size K from a set of N items is required. It's suitable for problems needing to explore every possible configuration of K elements.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique subsets of size K from a set of N distinct elements, commonly employing recursion or bit manipulation. The typical time complexity is O(N choose K * K) for construction or O(N choose K) if just iterating.
#   • Invariants: The current partial combination always contains unique elements.; The number of elements chosen so far does not exceed K.
#   • Tips: Employ backtracking or recursion for a straightforward implementation.; Utilize bitmasks for efficient representation and generation, especially for smaller N.
#   • Pitfalls: Accidentally generating duplicate combinations if elements are not handled uniquely.; Failing to correctly define base cases or termination conditions for recursive calls.
# - Balanced Search Trees (tree, ds, recursion)
#   • When to use: When needing a self-balancing search tree that guarantees logarithmic time complexity for search and insertion operations. Useful for maintaining data in sorted order with consistent performance, especially when frequent updates are expected.
#   • Idea: A 2-3 tree is a self-balancing search tree where every node has either two children (a 2-node) or three children (a 3-node), ensuring all leaves are at the same depth. It guarantees O(log N) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
#   • Invariants: All leaves are at the same depth from the root.; Every node is either a 2-node (one key, two children) or a 3-node (two keys, three children).
#   • Tips: Understand the two node types: 2-nodes (one key, two children) and 3-nodes (two keys, three children).; Insertion always starts by finding the leaf position, then propagates splits upwards if a 4-node is formed.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the promotion of keys during node splits can break the tree's structure.; Forgetting to update parent links after a node split or merge operation.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
