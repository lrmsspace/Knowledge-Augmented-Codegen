# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/resulting-string-after-adjacent-removals/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.
#
# You must repeatedly perform the following operation while the string s has at least two consecutive characters:
#
#
# 	Remove the leftmost pair of adjacent characters in the string that are consecutive in the alphabet, in either order (e.g., 'a' and 'b', or 'b' and 'a').
# 	Shift the remaining characters to the left to fill the gap.
#
#
# Return the resulting string after no more operations can be performed.
#
# Note: Consider the alphabet as circular, thus 'a' and 'z' are consecutive.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "abc"
#
# Output: "c"
#
# Explanation:
#
#
# 	Remove "ab" from the string, leaving "c" as the remaining string.
# 	No further operations are possible. Thus, the resulting string after all possible removals is "c".
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# 	s consists only of lowercase English letters.

# - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
#   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
#   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
#   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
# - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (heap, interval, greedy, simulation)
#   • When to use: When needing to find an optimal schedule for a set of jobs, each with a deadline and duration, typically to maximize completed jobs or minimize total lateness. This approach often involves processing jobs based on deadlines and dynamically selecting tasks.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal job schedule by processing jobs sorted by their deadlines, using a priority queue to manage available tasks. It greedily selects jobs with the shortest run-time that can be completed within the current time window, achieving an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All jobs with deadlines greater than the current job's deadline have been considered.; The priority queue contains jobs that can potentially be scheduled within the current time window.
#   • Tips: Sort jobs by deadline in descending order to process later deadlines first.; Use a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve the job with the least run-time.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly sorting jobs (e.g., ascending deadline or by duration).; Not handling overlapping time intervals or deadlines properly.
# - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
#   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
#   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
