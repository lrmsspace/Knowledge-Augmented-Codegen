# Problem Description:
# Given an array nums of distinct positive integers, return the number of tuples (a, b, c, d) such that a * b = c * d where a, b, c, and d are elements of nums, and a != b != c != d.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,3,4,6]
# Output: 8
# Explanation: There are 8 valid tuples:
# (2,6,3,4) , (2,6,4,3) , (6,2,3,4) , (6,2,4,3)
# (3,4,2,6) , (4,3,2,6) , (3,4,6,2) , (4,3,6,2)
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
# 	1 <= nums[i] <= 104
# 	All elements in nums are distinct.

# - Catalan Numbers (number, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when counting arrangements of objects that follow a specific non-crossing or balancing rule, often involving recursive decomposition or paths constrained by a diagonal.
#   • Idea: Catalan numbers count the number of ways to arrange certain combinatorial objects, such as balanced parentheses sequences or monotonic paths that do not cross a diagonal. They can be computed using a recurrence relation (O(N^2) with DP) or a direct binomial coefficient formula (O(N) or O(N log N)).
#   • Invariants: dp[i] stores the i-th Catalan number, correctly computed from dp[0] through dp[i-1].; For each n, the sum sum(dp[k] * dp[n-1-k]) iterates through all valid partitions of the problem.
#   • Tips: Memoize the recursive solution to avoid redundant computations, transforming it into dynamic programming.; For large N, use modular arithmetic if results are required modulo a prime to prevent integer overflow.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to correctly handle the base cases, typically C0 = 1 and C1 = 1.; Encountering integer overflow when calculating large binomial coefficients without appropriate modular arithmetic.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
#   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
#   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
#   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
#   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
