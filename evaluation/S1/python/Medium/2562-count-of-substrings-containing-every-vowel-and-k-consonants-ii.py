# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-substrings-containing-every-vowel-and-k-consonants-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a string word and a non-negative integer k.
#
# Return the total number of substrings of word that contain every vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') at least once and exactly k consonants.
#
# Example:
# Input: word = "aeioqq", k = 1
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation:
#
# There is no substring with every vowel.
#
# Constraints:
# 5 <= word.length <= 2 * 105
#  word consists only of lowercase English letters.
#  0 <= k <= word.length - 5

# - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences of a pattern in a text, analyzing string periodicity, or counting distinct substrings. It is especially useful for processing extremely long or recursively defined strings where explicit construction is impossible.
#   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm leverages a precomputed prefix function (LPS array) to avoid redundant comparisons during string searching, achieving linear time complexity. The prefix function itself determines the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix, enabling various string property analyses in O(N) time.
#   • Invariants: For any index `i`, `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i]`.; During prefix function computation, `j` always represents the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i-1]` that is also a suffix.
#   • Tips: The prefix function `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix.; Concatenate pattern, a unique separator, and text (`P + # + T`) to find all pattern occurrences.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors with array indexing or the precise definition of the prefix function.; Incorrectly handling the unique separator character in concatenated strings, leading to false matches.
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
#   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
#   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
#   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
# - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
#   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
#   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
