# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
# Output: [0,6]
# Explanation:
# The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
# The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104
# 	s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - Suffix Array (string, array, counting-sort, radix-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently query or analyze all suffixes of a string, often for pattern matching, string searching, or finding repeated substrings. It provides a sorted order of all suffixes.
#   • Idea: The Suffix Array algorithm constructs an array containing the starting indices of all suffixes of a string, sorted lexicographically. It typically uses a doubling strategy with counting sort or radix sort in each step, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: After iteration k, p contains the sorted indices of all cyclic substrings of length 2^k.; After iteration k, c[i] represents the equivalence class of the cyclic substring starting at i with length 2^k.
#   • Tips: Append a unique, smallest character (e.g., '$') to the string to handle suffixes as cyclic shifts.; Utilize counting sort for efficient sorting of characters and pairs of equivalence classes.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the sentinel character can lead to incorrect suffix order or out-of-bounds access.; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices for cyclic shifts or substring lengths.
# - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
#   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
#   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
# - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
#   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
#   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
#   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
