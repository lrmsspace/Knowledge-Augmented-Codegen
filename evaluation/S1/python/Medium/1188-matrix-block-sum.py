# Problem Description:
# Given a m x n matrix mat and an integer k, return a matrix answer where each answer[i][j] is the sum of all elements mat[r][c] for:
#
#
# 	i - k <= r <= i + k,
# 	j - k <= c <= j + k, and
# 	(r, c) is a valid position in the matrix.
#
# Example:
# Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 1
# Output: [[12,21,16],[27,45,33],[24,39,28]]
#
# Constraints:
# m == mat.length
# 	n == mat[i].length
# 	1 <= m, n, k <= 100
# 	1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100

# - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, sparse-table, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: When you need O(1) query time for any associative operation (like sum, min, max, GCD) on a static array, after an O(N log N) preprocessing step.
#   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that supports O(1) range queries for any associative operation on a static array. It achieves this by precomputing results for specific disjoint and overlapping ranges, with an O(N log N) construction time and space complexity.
#   • Invariants: table[k][i] stores the result of the operation for a range of length 2^k starting at index i.; For any query [L, R], the result is obtained by combining two precomputed values from blocks that cover [L, mid] and [mid+1, R].
#   • Tips: Understand the block decomposition based on powers of two for construction.; Queries combine results from two precomputed blocks that cover the query range.
#   • Pitfalls: Does not support point updates efficiently; any modification requires a full rebuild.; Higher space complexity of O(N log N) compared to some other range query structures.
# - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, prefix-sum, mod-exp)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to compute modular inverses for multiple numbers in an array or a range, especially when efficiency is critical, by leveraging prefix and suffix products to reduce inverse computations.
#   • Idea: This technique efficiently computes modular inverses for multiple numbers by transforming individual inverse calculations into a product of prefix, suffix, and a single overall inverse. It achieves O(N + log M) complexity for an array or O(M) for a range.
#   • Invariants: For 0 <= i < N, prefix_products[i] holds (arr[0] * ... * arr[i-1]) % m.; For 0 <= i < N, suffix_products[i] holds (arr[i+1] * ... * arr[N-1]) % m.
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix products and suffix products of the array elements modulo m.; Calculate the modular inverse of the total product of all elements once using modular exponentiation.
#   • Pitfalls: Ensure all numbers for which an inverse is sought are coprime to the modulus m.; Watch for off-by-one errors when calculating prefix and suffix product indices.
# - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: When you need to calculate the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in sequential order. It efficiently handles both convex and non-convex polygons.
#   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing the signed areas of trapezoids or triangles formed by its edges and a reference point/axis. It achieves O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The sum accumulates the signed area contribution of processed edges.; The current vertex and the next vertex define an edge of the polygon.
#   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in sequential order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; The absolute value of the final result is the polygon's area.
#   • Pitfalls: Supplying vertices in a non-sequential or arbitrary order will yield an incorrect area.; Applying the formula to self-intersecting polygons will not give the true geometric area.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
