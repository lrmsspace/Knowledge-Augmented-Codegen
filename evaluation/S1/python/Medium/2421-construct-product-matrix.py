# Problem Description:
# Given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * m, we define a 0-indexed 2D matrix p of size n * m as the product matrix of grid if the following condition is met:
#
#
# 	Each element p[i][j] is calculated as the product of all elements in grid except for the element grid[i][j]. This product is then taken modulo 12345.
#
#
# Return the product matrix of grid.
#
# Example:
# Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
# Output: [[24,12],[8,6]]
# Explanation: p[0][0] = grid[0][1] * grid[1][0] * grid[1][1] = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
# p[0][1] = grid[0][0] * grid[1][0] * grid[1][1] = 1 * 3 * 4 = 12
# p[1][0] = grid[0][0] * grid[0][1] * grid[1][1] = 1 * 2 * 4 = 8
# p[1][1] = grid[0][0] * grid[0][1] * grid[1][0] = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
# So the answer is [[24,12],[8,6]].
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n == grid.length <= 105
# 	1 <= m == grid[i].length <= 105
# 	2 <= n * m <= 105
# 	1 <= grid[i][j] <= 109

# - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, prefix-sum, mod-exp)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to compute modular inverses for multiple numbers in an array or a range, especially when efficiency is critical, by leveraging prefix and suffix products to reduce inverse computations.
#   • Idea: This technique efficiently computes modular inverses for multiple numbers by transforming individual inverse calculations into a product of prefix, suffix, and a single overall inverse. It achieves O(N + log M) complexity for an array or O(M) for a range.
#   • Invariants: For 0 <= i < N, prefix_products[i] holds (arr[0] * ... * arr[i-1]) % m.; For 0 <= i < N, suffix_products[i] holds (arr[i+1] * ... * arr[N-1]) % m.
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix products and suffix products of the array elements modulo m.; Calculate the modular inverse of the total product of all elements once using modular exponentiation.
#   • Pitfalls: Ensure all numbers for which an inverse is sought are coprime to the modulus m.; Watch for off-by-one errors when calculating prefix and suffix product indices.
# - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, interval, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find or count all integer solutions (x, y) for a linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, especially when solutions are constrained within specific intervals for x and y.
#   • Idea: This method finds all integer solutions to a linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c within given x and y intervals. It first finds a particular solution, then uses properties of the general solution to determine the valid range for x, and enumerates solutions in O(N) time where N is the number of solutions.
#   • Invariants: The current (x, y) pair always satisfies the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c.; The current x value is an integer and satisfies the effective bounds l_x <= x <= r_x.
#   • Tips: Pre-divide coefficients a, b, c by gcd(a, b) to simplify the equation.; Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find an initial particular solution (x0, y0).
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to check if c is divisible by gcd(a, b) before proceeding, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly applying the shifting logic for x and y bounds, resulting in an invalid solution range.
# - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
#   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
#   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
#   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
#   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
