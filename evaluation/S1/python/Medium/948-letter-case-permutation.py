#
# Problem Description:
# Given a string s, you can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string.
#
# Return a list of all possible strings we could create. Return the output in any order.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "a1b2"
# Output: ["a1b2","a1B2","A1b2","A1B2"]
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 12
# 	s consists of lowercase English letters, uppercase English letters, and digits.

# - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
#   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
#   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
# - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, recursion, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when an exhaustive list of all subsets of a specific size K from a set of N items is required. It's suitable for problems needing to explore every possible configuration of K elements.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique subsets of size K from a set of N distinct elements, commonly employing recursion or bit manipulation. The typical time complexity is O(N choose K * K) for construction or O(N choose K) if just iterating.
#   • Invariants: The current partial combination always contains unique elements.; The number of elements chosen so far does not exceed K.
#   • Tips: Employ backtracking or recursion for a straightforward implementation.; Utilize bitmasks for efficient representation and generation, especially for smaller N.
#   • Pitfalls: Accidentally generating duplicate combinations if elements are not handled uniquely.; Failing to correctly define base cases or termination conditions for recursive calls.
# - String Sorts (array, string, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to sort a collection of strings lexicographically, especially when string lengths vary or are large, and the character set is limited.
#   • Idea: This algorithm sorts an array of strings lexicographically by recursively applying a counting sort-like distribution based on characters from most significant to least significant digit. It typically achieves O(N*L + R*L) time complexity, where N is the number of strings, L is the average string length, and R is the radix size.
#   • Invariants: All strings in the current `a[lo...hi]` sub-array share a common prefix of length `d`.; After the distribution pass for character `d`, `aux` contains strings from `a[lo...hi]` stably sorted by their `d`-th character.
#   • Tips: Use an auxiliary array for stable distribution during each pass to maintain relative order.; Implement a cutoff to insertion sort for small sub-arrays to improve performance due to lower overhead.
#   • Pitfalls: Can have high overhead for small N or short strings compared to comparison sorts.; Potentially memory intensive due to the auxiliary array and recursion stack depth proportional to max string length.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
