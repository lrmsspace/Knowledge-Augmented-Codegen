#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a string s and a positive integer k.
#
# Let vowels and consonants be the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
#
# A string is beautiful if:
#
#
# 	vowels == consonants.
# 	(vowels * consonants) % k == 0, in other terms the multiplication of vowels and consonants is divisible by k.
#
#
# Return the number of non-empty beautiful substrings in the given string s.
#
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
#
# Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
#
# Consonant letters in English are every letter except vowels.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "baeyh", k = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are 2 beautiful substrings in the given string.
# - Substring "baeyh", vowels = 2 (["a",e"]), consonants = 2 (["y","h"]).
# You can see that string "aeyh" is beautiful as vowels == consonants and vowels * consonants % k == 0.
# - Substring "baeyh", vowels = 2 (["a",e"]), consonants = 2 (["b","y"]). 
# You can see that string "baey" is beautiful as vowels == consonants and vowels * consonants % k == 0.
# It can be shown that there are only 2 beautiful substrings in the given string.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# 	1 <= k <= 1000
# 	s consists of only English lowercase letters.

# - Suffix array (array, string, suffix-array, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently perform various string operations like pattern searching, finding repeated substrings, or comparing suffixes lexicographically on a given text. It is a fundamental data structure for advanced string algorithms.
#   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string. It allows for efficient string operations, with construction typically achievable in O(N log N) or O(N) time for advanced algorithms.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array SA[i] stores the starting index of the i-th lexicographically smallest suffix.; All suffixes of the input string are present exactly once in the suffix array.
#   • Tips: Consider using SA-IS for optimal O(N) construction time and space complexity.; Pair the suffix array with an LCP array for enhanced functionality, such as finding longest common substrings.
#   • Pitfalls: Naive O(N^2 log N) construction is too slow for large input strings.; Implementing linear-time algorithms like SA-IS or DC3 can be complex and error-prone.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
#   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
#   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
#   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
