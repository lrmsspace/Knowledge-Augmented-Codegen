# Problem Description:
# Given an integer array arr, and an integer target, return the number of tuples i, j, k such that i < j < k and arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == target.
#
# As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
# Example:
# Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], target = 8
# Output: 20
# Explanation: 
# Enumerating by the values (arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]):
# (1, 2, 5) occurs 8 times;
# (1, 3, 4) occurs 8 times;
# (2, 2, 4) occurs 2 times;
# (2, 3, 3) occurs 2 times.
#
# Constraints:
# 3 <= arr.length <= 3000
# 	0 <= arr[i] <= 100
# 	0 <= target <= 300

# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
# - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (matrix, array, dp-2d, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to count elements satisfying "at least one" of several properties, especially when direct counting is complicated by overlapping sets. It's also applicable for counting elements satisfying "none" of the properties by subtracting from the total.
#   • Idea: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle is a combinatorial method to determine the size of the union of multiple finite sets. It works by summing the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all pairwise intersections, adding back the sizes of all three-way intersections, and so on, with alternating signs.
#   • Invariants: The count for any element satisfying `k` properties is adjusted to be exactly 1 in the final sum.; Each term in the sum corresponds to the size of an intersection of a distinct subset of properties.
#   • Tips: Clearly define the universe and the properties (sets) you are interested in.; Systematically list all combinations of properties for intersection terms.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying or defining the properties or sets.; Missing certain intersection terms or double-counting them.
# - Chinese Remainder Theorem (number, recursion, mod-exp)
#   • When to use: When you need to find a unique integer solution that satisfies a system of linear congruences with pairwise coprime moduli. It is used to reconstruct a number from its remainders modulo several divisors.
#   • Idea: The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) finds a unique solution x modulo the product of several pairwise coprime moduli, given a system of congruences. It typically involves computing modular inverses and combining solutions, with a complexity often dominated by modular exponentiation or extended Euclidean algorithm, usually O(N log M) or O(N log(max_modulus)).
#   • Invariants: The current combined solution 'x' satisfies 'x % m_i == a_i' for all congruences '(a_i, m_i)' processed so far.; The current combined modulus 'M' is the product of all individual moduli processed so far.
#   • Tips: Ensure all moduli are pairwise coprime for a unique solution.; Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find modular inverses.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if moduli are pairwise coprime.; Incorrectly calculating modular inverses.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
