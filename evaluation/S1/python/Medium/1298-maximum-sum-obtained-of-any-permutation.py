# Problem Description:
# We have an array of integers, nums, and an array of requests where requests[i] = [starti, endi]. The ith request asks for the sum of nums[starti] + nums[starti + 1] + ... + nums[endi - 1] + nums[endi]. Both starti and endi are 0-indexed.
#
# Return the maximum total sum of all requests among all permutations of nums.
#
# Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], requests = [[1,3],[0,1]]
# Output: 19
# Explanation: One permutation of nums is [2,1,3,4,5] with the following result: 
# requests[0] -> nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8
# requests[1] -> nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 1 = 3
# Total sum: 8 + 3 = 11.
# A permutation with a higher total sum is [3,5,4,2,1] with the following result:
# requests[0] -> nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
# requests[1] -> nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 5  = 8
# Total sum: 11 + 8 = 19, which is the best that you can do.
#
# Constraints:
# n == nums.length
# 	1 <= n <= 105
# 	0 <= nums[i] <= 105
# 	1 <= requests.length <= 105
# 	requests[i].length == 2
# 	0 <= starti <= endi < n

# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
#   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
# - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
#   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
#   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
# - String Sorts (array, string, number, radix-sort, counting-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when sorting a large collection of fixed-length strings or integers, especially when the key range (alphabet size) is small. It is efficient for data with uniform key lengths.
#   • Idea: LSD Radix Sort sorts elements by processing digits or characters from the least significant to the most significant, using a stable counting sort for each position. It achieves a time complexity of O(W * (N + R)), where W is the key length, N is the number of items, and R is the radix.
#   • Invariants: After each pass 'd' (from 'w-1' down to '0'), the array 'a' is stably sorted based on characters from position 'd' to 'w-1'.; The 'count' array accurately reflects the frequency of each character at the current digit 'd' before cumulation.
#   • Tips: Utilize counting sort as the stable inner sorting algorithm for each digit pass.; Process characters or digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
#   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for variable-length strings without proper padding or specialized handling.; Can be slower than comparison sorts for small input sizes or very large radix (R).
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
