# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-domino-rotations-for-equal-row/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# In a row of dominoes, tops[i] and bottoms[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the ith domino. (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)
#
# We may rotate the ith domino, so that tops[i] and bottoms[i] swap values.
#
# Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in tops are the same, or all the values in bottoms are the same.
#
# If it cannot be done, return -1.
#
# Example:
# Input: tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# The first figure represents the dominoes as given by tops and bottoms: before we do any rotations.
# If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= tops.length <= 2 * 104
# 	bottoms.length == tops.length
# 	1 <= tops[i], bottoms[i] <= 6

# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
#   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
# - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
#   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
#   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
#   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
#   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
# - Convex Hull construction (geometry, array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a plane. It is fundamental for various geometric algorithms and optimization problems.
#   • Idea: Convex hull construction identifies the subset of points that form the vertices of the smallest convex polygon containing all given points. Common algorithms achieve this in O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The sequence of points currently forming the hull maintains a convex property.; All points considered up to the current iteration are either part of the hull or lie within the polygon defined by the hull.
#   • Tips: Sort points by X-coordinate (and Y for ties) as a common preprocessing step.; Consider algorithms like Graham Scan or Monotone Chain for efficiency.
#   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect orientation calculations.; Incorrectly handling collinear points can result in non-minimal hulls or errors.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
