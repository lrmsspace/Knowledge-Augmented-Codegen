# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-search-tree-from-preorder-traversal/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given an array of integers preorder, which represents the preorder traversal of a BST (i.e., binary search tree), construct the tree and return its root.
#
# It is guaranteed that there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements for the given test cases.
#
# A binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of Node.left has a value strictly less than Node.val, and any descendant of Node.right has a value strictly greater than Node.val.
#
# A preorder traversal of a binary tree displays the value of the node first, then traverses Node.left, then traverses Node.right.
#
# Example:
# Input: preorder = [8,5,1,7,10,12]
# Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= preorder.length <= 100
# 	1 <= preorder[i] <= 1000
# 	All the values of preorder are unique.

# - Binary Search Trees
#  (tree, recursion)
#   • When to use: When you need to store ordered data that allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion while maintaining sorted order. It's suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change.
#   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(log N) average time and O(N) worst-case.
#   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than its key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than its key.
#   • Tips: Maintain the BST property: left child < parent < right child.; Recursion simplifies many operations like search, insert, and traversal.
#   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade performance to O(N) for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can break BST properties or lead to data loss.
# - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
#   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
#   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.
# - Depth-first search (graph, array, dfs, biconnected-components)
#   • When to use: Use when exploring all reachable nodes from a starting point, finding paths, or detecting cycles in a graph. It's suitable for problems requiring a deep, exhaustive search.
#   • Idea: Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically running in O(V + E) time for graphs represented with adjacency lists.
#   • Invariants: Every node `v` is visited exactly once.; When `dfs(G, u, v)` is called, `v` is unvisited and `u` is its immediate predecessor in the current path.
#   • Tips: Maintain a visited set/array to avoid revisiting nodes and infinite loops.; Pass the parent node in recursive calls to correctly identify back-edges for cycle detection.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.; Deep recursion can cause stack overflow errors on large graphs; use an iterative approach if needed.

# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
