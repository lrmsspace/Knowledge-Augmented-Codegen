#
# Problem Description:
# The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.
#
# Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
#
# Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
# 	0 <= Node.val <= 104

# - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
#   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
#   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
#   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
#   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
#   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
#   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
# - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: Use when selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and value, to maximize total value without exceeding a given capacity. It is applicable for resource allocation problems with discrete choices.
#   • Idea: The Knapsack Problem aims to choose items with maximum total value such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It is typically solved using dynamic programming, achieving a time complexity of O(nW) for n items and capacity W.
#   • Invariants: `dp[j]` (in 1D DP) represents the maximum value achievable with capacity `j` using items considered so far.; When processing item `i` and capacity `j` (decreasing `j`), `dp[j-weight_i]` holds the value from previous items for that reduced capacity.
#   • Tips: Initialize DP table with zeros for capacity 0 and unreachable states.; For 0-1 knapsack with 1D DP, iterate capacity `j` in decreasing order.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrect iteration order for 1D DP in 0-1 knapsack (using increasing `j`).; Off-by-one errors in item indices or capacity calculations.
