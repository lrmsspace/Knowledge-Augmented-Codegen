# Problem Description:
# Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
#
# Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range. 
#
# Given the positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, return the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.
#
# Notice that all the heaters follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will be the same.
#
# Example:
# Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= houses.length, heaters.length <= 3 * 104
# 	1 <= houses[i], heaters[i] <= 109

# - Mergesort (array, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity sort is required, especially for large datasets or when external sorting is beneficial. It is also suitable for linked lists where random access is inefficient.
#   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo...mid]` and the right subarray `a[mid+1...hi]` are sorted.; During the merge, `a[lo...k-1]` contains the `k-lo` smallest elements from `aux[lo...hi]` in sorted order.
#   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for merging to maintain stability and simplify the merge logic.; Consider the bottom-up iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits and potentially improve cache performance.
#   • Pitfalls: Requires O(N) auxiliary space, which can be a significant concern for memory-constrained environments.; Recursive implementations can lead to stack overflow errors for extremely large input arrays.
# - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, enumeration)
#   • When to use: When searching for a specific element in a sorted collection or finding an optimal value over a monotonic function within a defined range. It efficiently reduces the search space by half in each step.
#   • Idea: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or determines a value that satisfies a monotonic predicate. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log N).
#   • Invariants: The potential answer always lies within the current search interval `[low, high]`.; All elements strictly less than `low` have been determined not to be the answer.
#   • Tips: Ensure the search space exhibits a monotonic property.; Carefully define the `low` and `high` bounds for the search interval.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating `low` or `high` bounds leading to infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing or loop conditions.
# - Minimum Enclosing Circle (array, geometry, randomized, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the smallest circle that contains a given set of 2D points. It provides an expected linear time solution for this fundamental geometric problem.
#   • Idea: Welzl's algorithm finds the unique minimum enclosing circle for a set of points using a randomized incremental approach. It achieves an expected time complexity of O(N).
#   • Invariants: The current candidate circle `C` encloses all points `p_1, ..., p_i` processed so far.; If `p_i` is not contained in `C_{i-1}`, then `p_i` must lie on the boundary of `C_i`.
#   • Tips: Randomly permute input points to ensure expected O(N) performance.; The MEC is uniquely determined by either two points forming a diameter or three points on its boundary.
#   • Pitfalls: Not randomizing the input can lead to a worst-case O(N^3) performance.; Floating-point precision issues can cause incorrect boundary checks or point containment tests.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
