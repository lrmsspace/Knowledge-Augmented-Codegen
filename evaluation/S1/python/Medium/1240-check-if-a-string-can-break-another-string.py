# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-string-can-break-another-string/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given two strings: s1 and s2 with the same size, check if some permutation of string s1 can break some permutation of string s2 or vice-versa. In other words s2 can break s1 or vice-versa.
#
# A string x can break string y (both of size n) if x[i] >= y[i] (in alphabetical order) for all i between 0 and n-1.
#
# Example:
# Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "xya"
# Output: true
# Explanation: "ayx" is a permutation of s2="xya" which can break to string "abc" which is a permutation of s1="abc".
#
# Constraints:
# s1.length == n
# 	s2.length == n
# 	1 <= n <= 10^5
# 	All strings consist of lowercase English letters.

# - Mergesort (array, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity sort is required, especially for large datasets or when external sorting is beneficial. It is also suitable for linked lists where random access is inefficient.
#   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo...mid]` and the right subarray `a[mid+1...hi]` are sorted.; During the merge, `a[lo...k-1]` contains the `k-lo` smallest elements from `aux[lo...hi]` in sorted order.
#   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for merging to maintain stability and simplify the merge logic.; Consider the bottom-up iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits and potentially improve cache performance.
#   • Pitfalls: Requires O(N) auxiliary space, which can be a significant concern for memory-constrained environments.; Recursive implementations can lead to stack overflow errors for extremely large input arrays.
# - Suffix Array (string, array, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query properties of all suffixes or substrings of a given text, especially for pattern matching or finding repeated structures. It is particularly useful for problems requiring lexicographical ordering of all suffixes.
#   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing their starting indices. It enables efficient string operations like pattern searching and finding longest common prefixes, typically constructed in O(N log N) time.
#   • Invariants: After k iterations, suffixes are sorted correctly up to a certain length (e.g., 2^k).; All suffixes of the original string are represented by their starting indices in the array.
#   • Tips: Append a unique sentinel character (e.g., '$') smaller than any other character to the string.; Utilize the LCP array, often built alongside, for advanced string queries and optimizations.
#   • Pitfalls: Naive sorting of suffixes by string comparison leads to an inefficient O(N^2 log N) complexity.; High memory usage for very long strings due to storing all suffixes implicitly or explicitly.
# - String Hashing (string, number, hashing, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare strings, find duplicate strings, or perform fast substring searches and pattern matching in O(1) time after initial O(N) preprocessing.
#   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to a numerical value using a polynomial function, enabling O(1) comparison of strings or substrings after O(N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: prefix_hash[i] stores the polynomial hash of the substring s[0...i-1].; p_power[k] stores p^k mod m for efficient calculation.
#   • Tips: Use two different hash functions with distinct prime `p` and `m` values to minimize collision probability.; Precompute powers of `p` and prefix hashes to enable O(1) substring hash calculation.
#   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions can lead to incorrect results; always consider their possibility.; Integer overflow if modulo operations are not applied correctly at each step of calculation.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
