# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-prime-numbers-in-range/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given two positive integers left and right, find the two integers num1 and num2 such that:
#
#
# 	left <= num1 < num2 <= right .
# 	Both num1 and num2 are prime numbers.
# 	num2 - num1 is the minimum amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.
#
#
# Return the positive integer array ans = [num1, num2]. If there are multiple pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the smallest num1 value. If no such numbers exist, return [-1, -1].
#
# Example:
# Input: left = 10, right = 19
# Output: [11,13]
# Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 19 are 11, 13, 17, and 19.
# The closest gap between any pair is 2, which can be achieved by [11,13] or [17,19].
# Since 11 is smaller than 17, we return the first pair.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= left <= right <= 106

# - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, bitset, sieve)
#   • When to use: When you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit N, or efficiently check primality for many numbers within that range. It is ideal for precomputing primes.
#   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer N by iteratively marking multiples of each prime. It achieves O(N log log N) time complexity and O(N) space.
#   • Invariants: For any number i less than the current prime p, is_prime[i] correctly reflects its primality.; All multiples of primes smaller than the current prime p have already been marked as composite.
#   • Tips: Optimize by starting marking multiples from p*p for each prime p.; Use a bitset for memory efficiency when N is large.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to explicitly handle 0 and 1 as non-prime.; Incorrectly marking multiples, e.g., starting from 2*p instead of p*p.
# - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer, merge-sort, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use this when finding the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance in a 2D plane. It efficiently handles large datasets by recursively dividing the problem and merging results.
#   • Idea: It finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively dividing the set, solving subproblems, and merging results in O(N log N) time. The merge step efficiently handles cross-boundary pairs within a narrow strip.
#   • Invariants: The minimum distance returned by a recursive call is the true minimum for its input subset.; All points in the left subproblem have x-coordinates less than or equal to the median x-coordinate.
#   • Tips: Pre-sort points by x-coordinate to enable efficient splitting.; Maintain a y-sorted list of points for efficient merging of the strip.
#   • Pitfalls: An inefficient merge step can degrade complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2).; Failing to correctly identify and process cross-boundary pairs.
# - Linear Sieve (array, sieve, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a given limit N, or the smallest prime factor for every number up to N, with optimal linear time complexity.
#   • Idea: The Linear Sieve efficiently computes all prime numbers up to a limit N and the smallest prime factor for each integer. It processes every composite number exactly once by its smallest prime factor, achieving O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: For all `k < i`, `lp[k]` correctly stores the smallest prime factor of `k` (or `k` itself if prime).; The `pr` list contains all prime numbers less than `i` in ascending order.
#   • Tips: Initialize an array `lp` to store the smallest prime factor for each number.; Maintain a dynamically growing list of prime numbers found so far.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly marking composite numbers multiple times, leading to non-linear complexity.; Failing to stop the inner loop when `p > lp[i]`, which breaks the linearity guarantee.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
