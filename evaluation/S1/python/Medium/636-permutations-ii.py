#
# Problem Description:
# Given a collection of numbers, nums, that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations in any order.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,1,2]
# Output:
# [[1,1,2],
#  [1,2,1],
#  [2,1,1]]
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 8
# 	-10 <= nums[i] <= 10

# - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
#   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
#   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
# - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, recursion, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when an exhaustive list of all subsets of a specific size K from a set of N items is required. It's suitable for problems needing to explore every possible configuration of K elements.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique subsets of size K from a set of N distinct elements, commonly employing recursion or bit manipulation. The typical time complexity is O(N choose K * K) for construction or O(N choose K) if just iterating.
#   • Invariants: The current partial combination always contains unique elements.; The number of elements chosen so far does not exceed K.
#   • Tips: Employ backtracking or recursion for a straightforward implementation.; Utilize bitmasks for efficient representation and generation, especially for smaller N.
#   • Pitfalls: Accidentally generating duplicate combinations if elements are not handled uniquely.; Failing to correctly define base cases or termination conditions for recursive calls.
# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
#   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
#   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
