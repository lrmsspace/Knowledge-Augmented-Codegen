# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-nodes-in-the-sub-tree-with-the-same-label/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. The root of the tree is the node 0, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string labels (i.e. The node with the number i has the label labels[i]).
#
# The edges array is given on the form edges[i] = [ai, bi], which means there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
#
# Return an array of size n where ans[i] is the number of nodes in the subtree of the ith node which have the same label as node i.
#
# A subtree of a tree T is the tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendant nodes.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], labels = "abaedcd"
# Output: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]
# Explanation: Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.
# Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 105
# 	edges.length == n - 1
# 	edges[i].length == 2
# 	0 <= ai, bi < n
# 	ai != bi
# 	labels.length == n
# 	labels is consisting of only of lowercase English letters.

# - Counting labeled graphs (number, recursion, counting, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When the problem requires enumerating distinct labeled graphs with specific properties, such as connectivity, on a given number of vertices. It is suitable for combinatorial counting problems involving graph structures.
#   • Idea: This technique determines the number of connected labeled graphs by subtracting the count of disconnected graphs from the total. It typically employs a recursive or dynamic programming approach, often involving combinatorial terms like binomial coefficients, with a polynomial time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The total number of labeled graphs $G_n$ for $n$ vertices is always $2^{n(n-1)/2}$.; For any $n$, the sum of connected and disconnected labeled graphs equals the total number of labeled graphs.
#   • Tips: Start with the total number of labeled graphs $G_n = 2^{n(n-1)/2}$.; Use complementary counting: total graphs minus disconnected graphs.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to divide by $n$ when converting from rooted to unrooted disconnected graphs.; Incorrectly handling base cases for recursive definitions or DP states.
# - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
#   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
# - Undirected Graphs (graph, array, simulation)
#   • When to use: When modeling symmetric relationships between entities and needing to explore, analyze connectivity, or find paths within the network. Useful for problems involving reachability or structural properties.
#   • Idea: Undirected graphs represent symmetric relationships between pairs of vertices. Simulation on them involves systematically exploring or processing these connections, often with O(V+E) complexity for basic traversals.
#   • Invariants: All vertices reachable from the source within 'k' edges have been processed by the 'k'-th step of BFS.; Each edge in the graph is traversed at most twice (once for each direction) during a full graph traversal.
#   • Tips: Use an adjacency list for sparse graphs to optimize space and traversal time.; Use an adjacency matrix for dense graphs or when O(1) edge existence checks are critical.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected components, leading to incomplete graph processing.; Incorrectly representing undirected edges (e.g., only adding one direction to an adjacency list).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
