# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/most-stones-removed-with-same-row-or-column/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.
#
# A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.
#
# Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.
#
# Example:
# Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
# 1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
# 2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
# 3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
# 4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
# 5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
# Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= stones.length <= 1000
# 	0 <= xi, yi <= 104
# 	No two stones are at the same coordinate point.

# - Range Minimum Query (array, ds, union-find)
#   • When to use: Use when range minimum queries are needed on an array where elements can be dynamically removed or merged, and Union-Find is employed to manage the active state or connectivity of indices.
#   • Idea: Union-Find can be adapted to assist in range minimum queries, particularly when elements are dynamically removed or merged. It helps maintain connectivity of active elements or segments, allowing efficient traversal to find the minimum among available items, often with near-constant amortized time per Union-Find operation.
#   • Invariants: The `find` operation correctly returns the canonical representative for any element `i`.; Each set in the Union-Find structure maintains a property (e.g., minimum value, next available index) relevant to its merged elements.
#   • Tips: Utilize path compression and union by rank/size for optimal Union-Find performance.; Store relevant properties (e.g., minimum value, next available index) within the representative of each set.
#   • Pitfalls: Union-Find alone does not directly provide range minimums; it typically manages connectivity or availability.; Naive iteration through active elements found by Union-Find can be too slow for large ranges.
# - Finding Bridges Online (graph, ds, union-find, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when edges are added one by one to an initially empty graph and you need to efficiently track the number of bridges or 2-edge-connected components after each addition.
#   • Idea: This algorithm dynamically maintains the number of bridges in an undirected graph as edges are added incrementally. It leverages a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to achieve an amortized time complexity of O((N+M) log N).
#   • Invariants: Each DSU set represents a 2-edge-connected component or a collection of such components connected by bridges.; The total count of bridges accurately reflects edges whose removal increases connected components.
#   • Tips: Understand the properties of 2-edge-connected components and how they relate to bridges.; Carefully manage DSU operations, including path compression and union by rank/size, for optimal performance.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating the bridge count after an edge addition, especially when cycles are formed.; Inefficient DSU operations leading to a higher than expected time complexity.
# - Finding bridges in a graph in O(N+M) (graph, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to identify critical edges in an undirected graph whose removal would increase the number of connected components, effectively disconnecting parts of the graph.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds all bridges in an undirected graph by performing a Depth First Search and tracking discovery times and lowest reachable ancestors. It operates with an optimal time complexity of O(N+M).
#   • Invariants: For any visited vertex u, disc[u] stores its discovery time in the DFS tree.; For any visited vertex u, low[u] stores the minimum discovery time reachable from u (including u) through u's subtree and at most one back-edge.
#   • Tips: Maintain discovery times (disc) and low-link values (low) for each vertex during DFS.; Initialize low[u] = disc[u] when first visiting vertex u.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark visited nodes can lead to infinite loops or incorrect low-link values.; Incorrectly handling the parent edge during DFS, treating it as a back-edge.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
