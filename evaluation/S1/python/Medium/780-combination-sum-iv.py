# Problem Description:
# Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.
#
# The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# The possible combination ways are:
# (1, 1, 1, 1)
# (1, 1, 2)
# (1, 2, 1)
# (1, 3)
# (2, 1, 1)
# (2, 2)
# (3, 1)
# Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 200
# 	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# 	All the elements of nums are unique.
# 	1 <= target <= 1000
#
#
#  
# Follow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

# - Knapsack Problem (array, knapsack, dp-1d, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when selecting items from a set to maximize or minimize a value under a capacity constraint. It's also applicable for partitioning problems with a fixed budget.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity. It typically uses dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*W), where N is the number of items and W is the capacity.
#   • Invariants: After processing item `i`, `dp[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w` using items up to `i`.; For each item, `dp[w]` is updated considering either including or excluding the current item.
#   • Tips: Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` for item `i` and weight `w` for clarity, then optimize to 1D.; When optimizing to 1D, iterate weights downwards to avoid using an item multiple times.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the DP table can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.; Forgetting to iterate weights downwards in 1D DP can lead to items being picked multiple times (unbounded knapsack).
# - Counting labeled graphs (number, dp-2d, counting, recursion)
#   • When to use: When counting the total number of labeled graphs with a specific number of vertices and connected components. Useful for problems requiring enumeration of graph structures based on their connectivity properties.
#   • Idea: This technique uses dynamic programming to count labeled graphs with a given number of vertices and connected components by building up solutions from smaller subproblems. It leverages a recurrence relation that considers the component containing a specific vertex, leading to an O(N^2 * K) time complexity for N vertices and K components.
#   • Invariants: D[i][j] correctly stores the number of labeled graphs with i vertices and j components.; All C_s values for s < n are correctly precomputed before calculating D[n][k].
#   • Tips: Precompute binomial coefficients for efficiency.; Precompute the number of connected graphs (C_s) for all relevant s.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for the dynamic programming table.; Off-by-one errors in binomial coefficient calculations or array indexing.
# - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, enumeration)
#   • When to use: When all subsets of a fixed size K need to be generated, either in lexicographical order or such that successive combinations differ by exactly one element.
#   • Idea: This algorithm enumerates all K-combinations from a set, either in lexicographical order or using a Gray code approach where adjacent combinations differ by a single element. It typically runs in O(N choose K) time, generating each combination in O(K) or O(1) amortized time.
#   • Invariants: Each generated combination contains exactly K distinct elements.; All elements within a combination are unique and from the original set.
#   • Tips: For lexicographical generation, find the rightmost element that can be incremented without exceeding its maximum possible value.; After incrementing an element, set all subsequent elements to their minimum valid values.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions for the rightmost element or its maximum value.; Off-by-one errors when assigning subsequent elements after an increment.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
