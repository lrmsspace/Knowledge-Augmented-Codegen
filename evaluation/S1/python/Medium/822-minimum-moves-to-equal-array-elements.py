# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.
#
# In one move, you can increment n - 1 elements of the array by 1.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
# [1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
#
# Constraints:
# n == nums.length
# 	1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
# 	The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
#   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
# - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
#   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
#   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
#   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
#   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.
# - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
#   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
#   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
#   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
