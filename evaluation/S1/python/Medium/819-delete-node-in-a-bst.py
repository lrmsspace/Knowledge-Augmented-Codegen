# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
#
# Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
#
#
# 	Search for a node to remove.
# 	If the node is found, delete the node.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
# Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
# Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
# One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
# Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
# 	-105 <= Node.val <= 105
# 	Each node has a unique value.
# 	root is a valid binary search tree.
# 	-105 <= key <= 105

# - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
#   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
#   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
#   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
#   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Deleting from a data structure in_log_n (ds, segment-tree, dfs, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when processing a sequence of additions, deletions, and queries offline, where elements have specific time intervals of existence. It efficiently handles dynamic data structure operations by leveraging a segment tree over time.
#   • Idea: This technique uses a segment tree over the timeline of queries to manage elements with varying lifespans. Queries are processed offline via DFS, adding elements upon entering a node and undoing additions upon exiting, achieving O(T(n) log n) deletion complexity.
#   • Invariants: When entering a segment tree node, all elements associated with that node's time range are added to the active data structure.; When exiting a segment tree node, all elements added upon entry are removed, restoring the data structure to its state before entering.
#   • Tips: Ensure the base data structure supports efficient addition and undo operations.; Carefully manage element additions and removals during DFS traversal.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to undo changes when backtracking from a segment tree node.; Incorrectly mapping element lifespans to segment tree nodes.
# - Balanced Search Trees (tree, ds, binary-search, recursion)
#   • When to use: When you need to store a dynamic set of ordered data and require guaranteed logarithmic time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations, even in worst-case scenarios.
#   • Idea: Balanced search trees are a class of self-balancing binary search trees that maintain a logarithmic height to ensure O(log N) time complexity for core operations like search, insertion, and deletion. They achieve this balance through structural modifications such as rotations or node splitting/merging.
#   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are less than its key(s), and all keys in its right subtree are greater than its key(s).; The height of the tree is always proportional to log N, ensuring O(log N) operations.
#   • Tips: Understand the specific balancing rules (e.g., AVL rotations, Red-Black tree color properties, 2-3 tree node splits).; Consider the trade-offs between different balanced tree types (e.g., simpler implementation vs. stricter balance).
#   • Pitfalls: Implementation complexity can be high due to intricate rebalancing logic.; Overhead for rebalancing operations might be noticeable for very small N.

# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
