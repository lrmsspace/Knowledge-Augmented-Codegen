# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-most-competitive-subsequence/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given an integer array nums and a positive integer k, return the most competitive subsequence of nums of size k.
#
# An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.
#
# We define that a subsequence a is more competitive than a subsequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, subsequence a has a number less than the corresponding number in b. For example, [1,3,4] is more competitive than [1,3,5] because the first position they differ is at the final number, and 4 is less than 5.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
# Output: [2,6]
# Explanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	0 <= nums[i] <= 109
# 	1 <= k <= nums.length

# - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (queue, deque, monotonic-queue)
#   • When to use: Use this technique when you need to perform standard queue or stack operations while also querying the minimum (or maximum) element in O(1) time. It is ideal for problems involving sliding windows or dynamic collections where min/max queries are frequent.
#   • Idea: This technique augments a queue or stack with an auxiliary data structure, typically a deque, to maintain elements in monotonic order. This allows for O(1) retrieval of the minimum (or maximum) element, with standard operations achieving amortized O(1) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The auxiliary deque stores elements in non-decreasing order from front to back.; The element at the front of the auxiliary deque is the minimum of all elements currently in the main queue/stack.
#   • Tips: Utilize a deque for the auxiliary structure to efficiently add and remove from both ends.; For a minimum queue, maintain the auxiliary deque in non-decreasing order from front to back.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling removals when the element to be removed from the main structure is not the current minimum.; Forgetting to remove elements from the auxiliary deque when they are no longer relevant (e.g., out of window bounds).
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
#   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.

# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
