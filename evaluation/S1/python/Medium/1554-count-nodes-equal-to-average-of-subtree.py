# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-equal-to-average-of-subtree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the average of the values in its subtree.
#
# Note:
#
#
# 	The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.
# 	A subtree of root is a tree consisting of root and all of its descendants.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
# For the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.
# For the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.
# For the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.
# For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
# For the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# 	0 <= Node.val <= 1000

# - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
#   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
#   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
#   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
#   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
#   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
#   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
# - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
#   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
#   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.
