# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-or-at-least-k-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an array nums of non-negative integers and an integer k.
#
# An array is called special if the bitwise OR of all of its elements is at least k.
#
# Return the length of the shortest special non-empty subarray of nums, or return -1 if no special subarray exists.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 2
#
# Output: 1
#
# Explanation:
#
# The subarray [3] has OR value of 3. Hence, we return 1.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105
# 	0 <= nums[i] <= 109
# 	0 <= k <= 109

# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, greedy, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest or smallest sum, typically in linear time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array and maintaining a current sum, resetting it if it becomes detrimental. It operates in O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: `global_max` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray encountered up to the current element.; `current_max` holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray ending at the current element.
#   • Tips: Initialize current and global maximums appropriately (e.g., to negative infinity or first element).; Adapt for minimum sum by resetting current sum if it becomes positive.
#   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly initialize maximum/minimum sum variables.; Not handling arrays where all elements are negative (for max sum) or positive (for min sum).
# - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (queue, stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query the minimum element of a stack or queue in O(1) average time. Also applicable for finding minimums in all fixed-length subarrays using a sliding window.
#   • Idea: This technique augments a stack or queue to support O(1) average time retrieval of its minimum element, typically by storing minimums alongside data or using auxiliary structures. It achieves amortized constant time for all operations.
#   • Invariants: For a minimum stack, the auxiliary minimum stack's top element is always the minimum of all elements currently in the main stack.; For a minimum queue implemented with two stacks, the output stack is only refilled from the input stack when the output stack becomes empty.
#   • Tips: For a minimum stack, use an auxiliary stack to store minimums encountered so far.; Only push to the auxiliary minimum stack if the new element is less than or equal to its current top.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to pop from the auxiliary minimum stack when the main stack's top is removed.; Incorrectly handling the transfer logic between the two stacks for a minimum queue.
# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, ds, sliding-window, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when performing frequent range queries and point updates on an array, especially when a segment tree is too complex or memory-intensive, or when query types are diverse. It offers a balanced time complexity for both operations.
#   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and point updates. It achieves O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations.
#   • Invariants: Each element `arr[i]` belongs to exactly one block `block[i / block_size]`.; The summary for each block `block_summary[j]` accurately reflects the state of elements within block `j`.
#   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for balanced performance.; Precompute block summaries (e.g., sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or boundaries.; Forgetting to update the block's summary after a point update.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
