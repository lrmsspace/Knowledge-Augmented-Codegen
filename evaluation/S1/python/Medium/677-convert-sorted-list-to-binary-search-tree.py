# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.
#
# Example:
# Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
# Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
# Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 104].
# 	-105 <= Node.val <= 105
#
# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - Balanced Search Trees (tree, ds, recursion)
#   • When to use: When needing a self-balancing search tree that guarantees logarithmic time complexity for search and insertion operations. Useful for maintaining data in sorted order with consistent performance, especially when frequent updates are expected.
#   • Idea: A 2-3 tree is a self-balancing search tree where every node has either two children (a 2-node) or three children (a 3-node), ensuring all leaves are at the same depth. It guarantees O(log N) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
#   • Invariants: All leaves are at the same depth from the root.; Every node is either a 2-node (one key, two children) or a 3-node (two keys, three children).
#   • Tips: Understand the two node types: 2-nodes (one key, two children) and 3-nodes (two keys, three children).; Insertion always starts by finding the leaf position, then propagates splits upwards if a 4-node is formed.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the promotion of keys during node splits can break the tree's structure.; Forgetting to update parent links after a node split or merge operation.
# - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
#   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
#   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
#   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
