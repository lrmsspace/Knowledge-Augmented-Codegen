#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.
#
# There are two types of logs:
#
#
# 	Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
# 	Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.
#
#
# Reorder these logs so that:
#
#
# 	The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
# 	The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
# 	The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.
#
#
# Return the final order of the logs.
#
# Example:
# Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
# Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
# Explanation:
# The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is "art can", "art zero", "own kit dig".
# The digit-logs have a relative order of "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6".
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= logs.length <= 100
# 	3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
# 	All the tokens of logs[i] are separated by a single space.
# 	logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier and at least one word after the identifier.

# - String Sorts (array, string, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to sort a collection of strings lexicographically, especially when string lengths vary or are large, and the character set is limited.
#   • Idea: This algorithm sorts an array of strings lexicographically by recursively applying a counting sort-like distribution based on characters from most significant to least significant digit. It typically achieves O(N*L + R*L) time complexity, where N is the number of strings, L is the average string length, and R is the radix size.
#   • Invariants: All strings in the current `a[lo...hi]` sub-array share a common prefix of length `d`.; After the distribution pass for character `d`, `aux` contains strings from `a[lo...hi]` stably sorted by their `d`-th character.
#   • Tips: Use an auxiliary array for stable distribution during each pass to maintain relative order.; Implement a cutoff to insertion sort for small sub-arrays to improve performance due to lower overhead.
#   • Pitfalls: Can have high overhead for small N or short strings compared to comparison sorts.; Potentially memory intensive due to the auxiliary array and recursion stack depth proportional to max string length.
# - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure is required, and dynamic size with efficient O(1) push and pop operations is crucial, especially without a fixed capacity.
#   • Idea: This describes implementing a stack using a singly linked list, where elements are added and removed from the head of the list. Both push and pop operations achieve O(1) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The 'first' pointer always points to the top element of the stack, or is null if the stack is empty.; Each node's 'next' pointer correctly links to the subsequent element in the stack, maintaining the LIFO order.
#   • Tips: Maintain a 'first' pointer to the head of the linked list, representing the stack's top.; Push operation involves creating a new node, linking it to the current 'first', then updating 'first'.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case for pop, leading to `NoSuchElementException`.; Incorrectly updating the 'first' pointer during push or pop, which can break the list structure.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
