#
# Problem Description:
# Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
#
# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
#
#
# 	For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
#
#
# A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
#
# Example:
# Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
# Output: 3  
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
# 	text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
#   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
#   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
# - Suffix array (array, tree, string, suffix-array, tree-dp, lca)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to perform fast substring searches, pattern matching, or other string operations on a fixed text, especially when space efficiency is critical compared to suffix trees.
#   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing only their starting indices. It is often paired with an LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array to enable efficient string algorithms, typically achieving O(N log N) or O(N) construction and O(M + log N) or O(M) search complexity.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array `A` stores indices such that `S[A[i]:]` is lexicographically smaller than `S[A[i+1]:]` for all valid `i`.; The `lcp[i]` value represents the length of the longest common prefix between `S[A[i-1]:]` and `S[A[i]:]`.
#   • Tips: Pair with an LCP array to significantly speed up pattern searching and other string queries.; Consider Enhanced Suffix Arrays (ESA) for improved space and time efficiency over suffix trees, especially for large datasets.
#   • Pitfalls: Naive pattern searching without LCP information can be O(M log N), which might be too slow for long patterns.; Construction can be complex to implement efficiently in linear time.
# - Z-function and its calculation (string, array, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the length of the longest common prefix between a string and all its suffixes efficiently. It is fundamental for various string matching and pattern searching problems.
#   • Idea: The Z-function computes an array where each element z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the original string and its suffix starting at index i. This algorithm calculates the entire Z-array in O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: For all k < i, z[k] has been correctly computed.; The interval [l, r) always represents the rightmost segment match found so far.
#   • Tips: Leverage previously computed Z-values to avoid redundant comparisons.; Maintain a [l, r) window representing the rightmost segment match found so far.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the base case z[0] (usually set to 0).; Off-by-one errors when calculating the length of the prefix or updating the window.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
