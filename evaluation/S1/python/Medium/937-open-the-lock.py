# Problem Description:
# You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.
#
# The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.
#
# You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.
#
# Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.
#
# Example:
# Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: 
# A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
# Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
# because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= deadends.length <= 500
# 	deadends[i].length == 4
# 	target.length == 4
# 	target will not be in the list deadends.
# 	target and deadends[i] consist of digits only.

# - Breadth-first search (graph, queue, array, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or when exploring all reachable nodes level by level. It is also suitable for problems requiring traversal of all nodes at a specific distance from a source.
#   • Idea: Breadth-first search systematically explores a graph level by level, ensuring that all nodes at distance k are visited before any nodes at distance k+1. It finds the shortest path in terms of number of edges for unweighted graphs in O(V + E) time.
#   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue have been discovered and marked, but their adjacent nodes have not yet been fully explored.; For any node v marked as visited, distTo[v] stores the shortest path length from the source s to v.
#   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit.; Mark nodes as visited to prevent cycles and redundant processing.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops or incorrect paths.; Not handling disconnected graphs correctly.
# - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (trie, queue, bitset, aho-corasick, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use when searching for multiple patterns simultaneously within a larger text. It is highly efficient for finding all occurrences of a dictionary of keywords.
#   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a set of patterns, allowing efficient simultaneous searching for all patterns in a text. It typically achieves O(N + M + K) time complexity, where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
#   • Invariants: All patterns in the dictionary are correctly represented as paths in the trie structure.; For any state `s`, its failure link `fail[s]` points to the longest proper prefix of the string represented by `s` that is also a suffix of `s` and exists in the trie.
#   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, representing each pattern as a path.; Use BFS to construct failure links, pointing to the longest proper prefix of the current state's string that is also a suffix.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; High memory usage if the pattern set is very large or patterns are excessively long.
# - Undirected Graphs (graph, array, simulation)
#   • When to use: When modeling symmetric relationships between entities and needing to explore, analyze connectivity, or find paths within the network. Useful for problems involving reachability or structural properties.
#   • Idea: Undirected graphs represent symmetric relationships between pairs of vertices. Simulation on them involves systematically exploring or processing these connections, often with O(V+E) complexity for basic traversals.
#   • Invariants: All vertices reachable from the source within 'k' edges have been processed by the 'k'-th step of BFS.; Each edge in the graph is traversed at most twice (once for each direction) during a full graph traversal.
#   • Tips: Use an adjacency list for sparse graphs to optimize space and traversal time.; Use an adjacency matrix for dense graphs or when O(1) edge existence checks are critical.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected components, leading to incomplete graph processing.; Incorrectly representing undirected edges (e.g., only adding one direction to an adjacency list).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
