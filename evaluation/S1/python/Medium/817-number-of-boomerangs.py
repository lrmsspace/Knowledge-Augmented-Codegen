# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-boomerangs/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given n points in the plane that are all distinct, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).
#
# Return the number of boomerangs.
#
# Example:
# Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]].
#
# Constraints:
# n == points.length
# 	1 <= n <= 500
# 	points[i].length == 2
# 	-104 <= xi, yi <= 104
# 	All the points are unique.

# - Minimum Enclosing Circle (geometry, number, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the smallest circle that contains all given points in a 2D plane, often with a requirement for expected linear time complexity.
#   • Idea: This algorithm iteratively constructs the Minimum Enclosing Circle (MEC) by considering points one by one, potentially updating the circle if a new point lies outside. It achieves an expected linear time complexity, O(N), through randomization.
#   • Invariants: The current circle C is the MEC for the subset of points processed so far.; If C is defined by 1 point p_i, it is the MEC of points processed so far that passes through p_i.
#   • Tips: Randomly shuffle input points to achieve expected linear time complexity.; The Minimum Enclosing Circle is always defined by 2 or 3 points on its boundary.
#   • Pitfalls: A naive implementation without randomization can lead to O(N^3) worst-case time complexity.; Floating-point precision issues can arise in geometric calculations, requiring careful handling.
# - Counting labeled graphs (number, dp-2d, counting, recursion)
#   • When to use: When counting the total number of labeled graphs with a specific number of vertices and connected components. Useful for problems requiring enumeration of graph structures based on their connectivity properties.
#   • Idea: This technique uses dynamic programming to count labeled graphs with a given number of vertices and connected components by building up solutions from smaller subproblems. It leverages a recurrence relation that considers the component containing a specific vertex, leading to an O(N^2 * K) time complexity for N vertices and K components.
#   • Invariants: D[i][j] correctly stores the number of labeled graphs with i vertices and j components.; All C_s values for s < n are correctly precomputed before calculating D[n][k].
#   • Tips: Precompute binomial coefficients for efficiency.; Precompute the number of connected graphs (C_s) for all relevant s.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for the dynamic programming table.; Off-by-one errors in binomial coefficient calculations or array indexing.
# - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance among a given set of N points in a 2D plane. It is particularly effective for large datasets where an O(N^2) approach is too slow.
#   • Idea: This divide-and-conquer algorithm finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively splitting the set of points and merging results. It achieves an optimal time complexity of O(N log N).
#   • Invariants: At the start of any recursive call, the input point set is sorted by X-coordinate.; The returned minimum distance 'd' for a subproblem is the true minimum distance among its points.
#   • Tips: Initial sorting by X-coordinate is crucial for efficient division of the point set.; Handle base cases (e.g., 2 or 3 points) with a simple brute-force distance calculation.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to sort points by Y-coordinate within the central strip can degrade performance to O(N^2).; Incorrectly defining the strip width or comparison range in the merge step can lead to incorrect results.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
