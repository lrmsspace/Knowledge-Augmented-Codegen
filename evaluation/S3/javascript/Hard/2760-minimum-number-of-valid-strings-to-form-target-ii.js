// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-valid-strings-to-form-target-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of strings words and a string target.
//
// A string x is called valid if x is a prefix of any string in words.
//
// Return the minimum number of valid strings that can be concatenated to form target. If it is not possible to form target, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["abc","aaaaa","bcdef"], target = "aabcdabc"
//
// Output: 3
//
// Explanation:
//
// The target string can be formed by concatenating:
//
//
// 	Prefix of length 2 of words[1], i.e. "aa".
// 	Prefix of length 3 of words[2], i.e. "bcd".
// 	Prefix of length 3 of words[0], i.e. "abc".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 100
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 5 * 104
// 	The input is generated such that sum(words[i].length) <= 105.
// 	words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
// 	1 <= target.length <= 5 * 104
// 	target consists only of lowercase English letters.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Tries (trie, tree, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing a collection of strings and requiring efficient prefix-based operations like search, insertion, deletion, or finding the longest common prefix.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where nodes represent characters and paths from the root represent strings. Operations like insertion, search, and deletion typically take O(L) time, where L is the length of the key.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node's children pointers correspond to the next character in a string.
//   • Tips: Mark nodes as 'end of word' to distinguish prefixes from complete words.; Use an array for children pointers if the alphabet size is small and fixed (e.g., ASCII).
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or very deep tries due to many empty child pointers.; Deletion can be complex, requiring careful handling of nodes that are part of other words.
// - Aho-Corasick algorithm (trie, graph, dfs, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when searching for all occurrences of a fixed set of multiple patterns within a larger text efficiently. It is ideal for problems requiring simultaneous matching of a dictionary of strings.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, enabling efficient simultaneous searching for all pattern occurrences within a given text. It operates in O(N + M + K) time, where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: Every node in the trie represents a prefix of at least one pattern.; A suffix link from node 'u' points to the node representing the longest proper suffix of 'u' that is also a prefix of some pattern.
//   • Tips: Build the trie for all patterns first, then compute suffix links.; Use BFS to construct suffix links level by level for efficiency.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building suffix links, especially for the root's children or when no direct transition exists.; High memory consumption if using arrays for transitions with a very large alphabet.
// - Tries (trie, array, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing string keys in a symbol table and needing efficient prefix, wildcard, or longest prefix matching operations, offering flexibility beyond binary search trees and speed comparable to hashing.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where keys are typically strings. It allows for efficient retrieval of keys based on their prefixes, achieving O(L) time complexity for operations, where L is the key length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node exists only if it is part of at least one stored key.
//   • Tips: Choose an appropriate branching factor (R) based on the alphabet size.; Represent children using arrays for fixed alphabets or hash maps for sparse ones.
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or sparse data.; Deletion of keys can be complex, requiring careful handling of empty branches.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
