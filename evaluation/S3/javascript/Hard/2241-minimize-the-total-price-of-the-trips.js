// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-total-price-of-the-trips/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There exists an undirected and unrooted tree with n nodes indexed from 0 to n - 1. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
//
// Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array price, where price[i] is the price of the ith node.
//
// The price sum of a given path is the sum of the prices of all nodes lying on that path.
//
// Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array trips, where trips[i] = [starti, endi] indicates that you start the ith trip from the node starti and travel to the node endi by any path you like.
//
// Before performing your first trip, you can choose some non-adjacent nodes and halve the prices.
//
// Return the minimum total price sum to perform all the given trips.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]], price = [2,2,10,6], trips = [[0,3],[2,1],[2,3]]
// Output: 23
// Explanation: The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 2. The first part shows the initial tree and the second part shows the tree after choosing nodes 0, 2, and 3, and making their price half.
// For the 1st trip, we choose path [0,1,3]. The price sum of that path is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
// For the 2nd trip, we choose path [2,1]. The price sum of that path is 2 + 5 = 7.
// For the 3rd trip, we choose path [2,1,3]. The price sum of that path is 5 + 2 + 3 = 10.
// The total price sum of all trips is 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.
// It can be proven, that 23 is the minimum answer that we can achieve.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 50
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
// 	edges represents a valid tree.
// 	price.length == n
// 	price[i] is an even integer.
// 	1 <= price[i] <= 1000
// 	1 <= trips.length <= 100
// 	0 <= starti, endi <= n - 1

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, binary-lifting, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use binary lifting when you need to answer multiple Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries or ancestor relationship checks efficiently on a static tree.
//   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestor pointers using DFS to answer Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries and ancestor checks in O(log N) time per query, after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` and power `k`, `up[u][k]` is the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; `depth[u]` correctly represents the distance from the root to node `u`.
//   • Tips: Precompute `up[u][k]` as the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; Use DFS to fill the `up` array and node depths.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating `log N` for array dimensions.; Failing to handle the root node's ancestors (e.g., `up[root][k]` should be itself or an invalid node).
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
//   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
//   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
