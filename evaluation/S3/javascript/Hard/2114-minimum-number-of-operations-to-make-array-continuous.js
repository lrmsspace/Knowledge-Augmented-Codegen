// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-continuous/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can replace any element in nums with any integer.
//
// nums is considered continuous if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
//
//
// 	All elements in nums are unique.
// 	The difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in nums equals nums.length - 1.
//
//
// For example, nums = [4, 2, 5, 3] is continuous, but nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is not continuous.
//
// Return the minimum number of operations to make nums continuous.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: nums is already continuous.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
//

// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, ds, sliding-window, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when performing frequent range queries and point updates on an array, especially when a segment tree is too complex or memory-intensive, or when query types are diverse. It offers a balanced time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and point updates. It achieves O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations.
//   • Invariants: Each element `arr[i]` belongs to exactly one block `block[i / block_size]`.; The summary for each block `block_summary[j]` accurately reflects the state of elements within block `j`.
//   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for balanced performance.; Precompute block summaries (e.g., sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or boundaries.; Forgetting to update the block's summary after a point update.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (tree, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently find the MEX of a sequence after multiple point updates, where the sequence elements are non-negative integers.
//   • Idea: This approach uses a segment tree or similar data structure to maintain counts of elements, allowing efficient O(log N) updates and O(log N) queries for the minimal excluded number (MEX). The core idea is to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sequence.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree correctly stores the count of distinct numbers within its represented range.; The MEX query always explores the leftmost child first if its range is not 'full' (i.e., missing elements).
//   • Tips: Build the tree over the range of possible non-negative integer values, typically up to N or a maximum constraint.; Each tree node should store the count of distinct numbers present within its represented range.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle numbers larger than the maximum range covered by the segment tree.; Incorrectly updating counts for elements, leading to stale or erroneous MEX values.
// - Segment Tree (tree, array, segment-tree, merge-sort, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use when processing range queries or updates on an array, or when efficient searching and sorting of data are required. It's also applicable for problems that can be broken down into smaller, independent subproblems.
//   • Idea: This card describes techniques for efficiently handling range queries and updates on arrays, as well as searching and sorting elements. These methods typically achieve logarithmic time complexity for operations.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree represents a specific range of the original array.; The target element, if present, is always within the current binary search interval [low, high].
//   • Tips: Segment trees are powerful for static arrays with dynamic queries.; Merge sort's divide-and-conquer approach can be adapted for counting inversions.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in binary search bounds.; Incorrect segment tree node merging logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
