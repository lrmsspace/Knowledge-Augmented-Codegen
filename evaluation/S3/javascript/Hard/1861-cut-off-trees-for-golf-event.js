// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are asked to cut off all the trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as an m x n matrix. In this matrix:
//
//
// 	0 means the cell cannot be walked through.
// 	1 represents an empty cell that can be walked through.
// 	A number greater than 1 represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height.
//
//
// In one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west. If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.
//
// You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes 1 (an empty cell).
//
// Starting from the point (0, 0), return the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees. If you cannot cut off all the trees, return -1.
//
// Note: The input is generated such that no two trees have the same height, and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.
//
// Example:
// Input: forest = [[1,2,3],[0,0,4],[7,6,5]]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: Following the path above allows you to cut off the trees from shortest to tallest in 6 steps.
//
// Constraints:
// m == forest.length
// 	n == forest[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 50
// 	0 <= forest[i][j] <= 109
// 	Heights of all trees are distinct.

// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when counting labeled trees or converting between a labeled tree and a unique sequence representation for combinatorial analysis. It provides a bijection for problems involving N labeled nodes.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence of length N-2 that represents a labeled tree with N nodes. It is constructed by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor, and can be reconstructed back into the tree.
//   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always contains N-2 elements for a tree with N nodes.; At each step of encoding, the removed node is a leaf with the smallest label among all current leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for efficient updates.; Use a min-priority queue to quickly find the smallest-labeled leaf.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating node degrees after removal.; Off-by-one errors when dealing with 0-indexed vs. 1-indexed labels.
// - Minimum spanning tree - Prim's algorithm (graph, matrix, array, mst-prim, greedy)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a minimum spanning tree in a connected, weighted graph, especially efficient for dense graphs or when starting from an arbitrary vertex.
//   • Idea: Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that constructs a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by iteratively adding the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the growing tree to a vertex outside it. It typically runs in O(E log V) with a priority queue or O(V^2) with an adjacency matrix.
//   • Invariants: The set of edges chosen so far forms a tree (no cycles) and connects a subset of vertices.; At each step, the chosen edge is the minimum weight edge connecting a vertex in the current MST to a vertex outside it.
//   • Tips: Initialize distances (or minimum edge weights) for all vertices not in the MST to infinity.; Use a priority queue to efficiently retrieve the minimum weight edge connecting to the current MST.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly update edge weights to neighbors when a new vertex is added to the MST.; Not handling disconnected graphs, which will result in only an MST for the starting component.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
