//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array points containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane, sorted by the x-values, where points[i] = [xi, yi] such that xi < xj for all 1 <= i < j <= points.length. You are also given an integer k.
//
// Return the maximum value of the equation yi + yj + |xi - xj| where |xi - xj| <= k and 1 <= i < j <= points.length.
//
// It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint |xi - xj| <= k.
//
// Example:
// Input: points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The first two points satisfy the condition |xi - xj| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.
// No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= points.length <= 105
// 	points[i].length == 2
// 	-108 <= xi, yi <= 108
// 	0 <= k <= 2 * 108
// 	xi < xj for all 1 <= i < j <= points.length
// 	xi form a strictly increasing sequence.

// - Knapsack Problem (array, deque, knapsack, dp-1d, monotonic-queue)
//   • When to use: When optimizing the knapsack problem where multiple identical items are available, reducing the DP transition from O(max_count) to O(1) using a sliding window maximum technique.
//   • Idea: The Knapsack problem involves selecting items with weights and values to maximize total value within a capacity constraint. This specific variant, often for multiple identical items, uses dynamic programming optimized with a monotonic queue to achieve an O(NW) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: `dp[c]` represents the maximum value achievable for capacity `c` considering all items processed up to the current iteration.; For each remainder `y`, the deque stores indices `k` such that `G_{k, y}` values are monotonically decreasing from front to back.
//   • Tips: Carefully define DP states, often `dp[c]` for the maximum value at capacity `c`.; For multiple items, iterate through items and then capacities, or vice-versa, considering `w_i` remainder groups.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling item counts or capacity limits in DP transitions.; Off-by-one errors in monotonic queue window management, leading to incorrect maximums.
// - Convex hull trick and Li Chao tree (array, number, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when the optimal solution for a subproblem depends only on solutions to smaller, contiguous subproblems. It's effective for optimizing sequential decision-making or finding optimal values in arrays.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming 1D solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results to avoid recomputation. It typically achieves O(N) or O(N log N) time and O(N) or O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] correctly stores the optimal solution for the subproblem ending at index i.; All dp[j] for j < i have been computed and are correct.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the state: what does dp[i] represent for the subproblem?; Establish correct base cases for the smallest subproblems.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the state or recurrence relation.; Missing or incorrect base cases, leading to incorrect results.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
