// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-building-height/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You want to build n new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from 1 to n.
//
// However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:
//
//
// 	The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
// 	The height of the first building must be 0.
// 	The height difference between any two adjacent buildings cannot exceed 1.
//
//
// Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array restrictions where restrictions[i] = [idi, maxHeighti] indicates that building idi must have a height less than or equal to maxHeighti.
//
// It is guaranteed that each building will appear at most once in restrictions, and building 1 will not be in restrictions.
//
// Return the maximum possible height of the tallest building.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[2,1],[4,1]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
// We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,1,2], and the tallest building has a height of 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 109
// 	0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 105)
// 	2 <= idi <= n
// 	idi is unique.
// 	0 <= maxHeighti <= 109

// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine to minimize the total weighted completion time, where each job has a processing time and a linear penalty coefficient.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine with linear penalty functions by sorting jobs based on a specific ratio. It achieves an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The partial schedule constructed so far is optimal for the jobs included.; For any two adjacent jobs 'j' and 'k' in the final schedule, if 'j' precedes 'k', then 'c_j/t_j >= c_k/t_k'.
//   • Tips: Derive the sorting criterion using an exchange argument for adjacent jobs.; The optimal order is determined by the ratio of cost coefficient to processing time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the sorting criterion, especially the ratio order.; Overlooking edge cases like zero processing times or zero penalty coefficients.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when tasks with associated processing times and costs need to be sequenced on a single machine to minimize a total objective function, typically involving weighted completion times or penalties. The optimal sequence is found by a greedy sort.
//   • Idea: This method finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine by sorting them according to a greedy criterion derived from an exchange argument. It achieves an optimal solution with O(N log N) time complexity, dominated by the sorting step.
//   • Invariants: The relative order of any two jobs i and j in the sorted sequence is consistent with the greedy comparison rule.; Any prefix of the sorted schedule represents an optimal ordering for the jobs within that prefix.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the objective function to be minimized.; Formulate the greedy sorting rule using an exchange argument for any two adjacent jobs.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly deriving the greedy comparison criterion.; Applying this method to problems with multiple machines or complex precedence constraints without adaptation.
// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, coordinate-compress, segment-tree, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements must be strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal substructure on sequences with an increasing property.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are in increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree with coordinate compression.
//   • Invariants: The `dp` array (or segment tree) stores information about the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The `dp` array, if used, remains sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) solution uses a `dp` array storing the smallest ending element for all increasing subsequences of a given length.; Binary search (`lower_bound`) efficiently finds the correct position to update in the `dp` array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates; LIS typically requires strictly increasing elements.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
