// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-an-original-string-exists-given-two-encoded-strings/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:
//
//
// 	Arbitrarily split it into a sequence of some number of non-empty substrings.
// 	Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).
// 	Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.
//
//
// For example, one way to encode an original string "abcdefghijklmnop" might be:
//
//
// 	Split it as a sequence: ["ab", "cdefghijklmn", "o", "p"].
// 	Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes ["ab", "12", "1", "p"].
// 	Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: "ab121p".
//
//
// Given two encoded strings s1 and s2, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits 1-9 (inclusive), return true if there exists an original string that could be encoded as both s1 and s2. Otherwise, return false.
//
// Note: The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.
//
// Example:
// Input: s1 = "internationalization", s2 = "i18n"
// Output: true
// Explanation: It is possible that "internationalization" was the original string.
// - "internationalization" 
//   -> Split:       ["internationalization"]
//   -> Do not replace any element
//   -> Concatenate:  "internationalization", which is s1.
// - "internationalization"
//   -> Split:       ["i", "nternationalizatio", "n"]
//   -> Replace:     ["i", "18",                 "n"]
//   -> Concatenate:  "i18n", which is s2
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 40
// 	s1 and s2 consist of digits 1-9 (inclusive), and lowercase English letters only.
// 	The number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.

// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: When counting numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based properties, or calculating a sum of such properties.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique used to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers within a given range, based on their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, processing digits from most significant to least significant, achieving a time complexity of O(log(N) * S * T) where S is sum/state range and T is tight constraint.
//   • Invariants: The `idx` parameter always represents the current digit position being processed, from most significant to least significant.; The `tight` boolean parameter accurately indicates if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's corresponding digit.
//   • Tips: Handle leading zeros carefully, often with a dedicated boolean state in the DP function.; Use a 'tight' or 'limit' boolean parameter to manage the upper bound constraint imposed by the original number.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint can lead to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to reset the memoization table for each new query or test case, especially in competitive programming.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
