// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-visited-nodes-in-a-directed-graph/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a directed graph consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n directed edges.
//
// You are given a 0-indexed array edges where edges[i] indicates that there is an edge from node i to node edges[i].
//
// Consider the following process on the graph:
//
//
// 	You start from a node x and keep visiting other nodes through edges until you reach a node that you have already visited before on this same process.
//
//
// Return an array answer where answer[i] is the number of different nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node i.
//
// Example:
// Input: edges = [1,2,0,0]
// Output: [3,3,3,4]
// Explanation: We perform the process starting from each node in the following way:
// - Starting from node 0, we visit the nodes 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
// - Starting from node 1, we visit the nodes 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
// - Starting from node 2, we visit the nodes 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
// - Starting from node 3, we visit the nodes 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 4.
//
// Constraints:
// n == edges.length
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= edges[i] <= n - 1
// 	edges[i] != i
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Checking a graph for acyclicity and finding a cycle in O(M) (graph, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine if a graph contains any cycles or to identify one such cycle. It is applicable to both directed and undirected graphs.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses Depth First Search to detect cycles in a graph by tracking visited states of nodes during traversal. It runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently on the DFS recursion stack are marked as 'gray' (or equivalent).; All nodes fully explored and not part of the current path are marked as 'black' (or equivalent).
//   • Tips: For directed graphs, use a three-color scheme (white, gray, black) to distinguish states.; For undirected graphs, a simple visited array and checking against the immediate parent is sufficient.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the parent edge in undirected graphs can lead to false cycle detections.; Failing to distinguish between nodes currently in the recursion stack (gray) and fully processed nodes (black) in directed graphs.
// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
