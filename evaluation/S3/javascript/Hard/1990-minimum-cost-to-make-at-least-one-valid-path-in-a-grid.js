// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-at-least-one-valid-path-in-a-grid/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:
//
//
// 	1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
// 	2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
// 	3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
// 	4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])
//
//
// Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.
//
// You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.
//
// You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.
//
// Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: You will start at point (0, 0).
// The path to (3, 3) is as follows. (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (1, 3) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 0) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (2, 0) --> (2, 1) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 3) change the arrow to down with cost = 1 --> (3, 3)
// The total cost = 3.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 100
// 	1 <= grid[i][j] <= 4
//

// - 0-1 BFS (graph, array, dijkstra, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum costs without a full priority queue.
//   • Idea: A specialized Breadth-First Search variant that finds shortest paths in graphs with only 0 or 1 edge weights. It uses a deque to process 0-weight edges before 1-weight edges, achieving O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the deque have a distance value of either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.; Nodes pushed to the front of the deque always have a distance equal to the current node's distance.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque to maintain the order of processing nodes.; Add nodes reached via 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a standard queue instead of a deque.; Failing to initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the source.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, queue, 01-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding shortest paths in a graph where edge weights are restricted to only 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum distances from a source to all reachable nodes, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
//   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds shortest paths from a single source in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It achieves this in O(V + E) time complexity by using a deque to prioritize 0-weight edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes in the deque have a distance value less than or equal to any node not yet processed.; Nodes added to the front of the deque (0-weight edges) always have a distance equal to the node they came from.
//   • Tips: Use a deque to maintain order: 0-weight edges go to front, 1-weight edges to back.; Initialize distances to infinity and source distance to 0.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update distances for 0-weight edges before adding to deque front.; Incorrectly handling visited states, leading to TLE or incorrect paths.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, deque, array, 01-bfs)
//   • When to use: When finding the shortest path in a graph where edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1, or when minimizing operations where some operations are 'free' (cost 0) and others have a unit cost (cost 1).
//   • Idea: A graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source to all reachable nodes in a graph where edge weights are either 0 or 1. It uses a deque to prioritize 0-cost edges, achieving an optimal O(V + E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Nodes are added to the front of the deque if the edge weight is 0, and to the back if 1.; The distance `dist[u]` for any node `u` in the deque is either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.
//   • Tips: Use a deque: push 0-cost edges to the front, 1-cost edges to the back.; Mark nodes visited to avoid cycles and redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling visited states can lead to infinite loops or incorrect paths.; Forgetting to initialize distances properly before starting the traversal.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
