// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-achievable-transfer-requests/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// We have n buildings numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.
//
// You are given an array requests where requests[i] = [fromi, toi] represents an employee's request to transfer from building fromi to building toi.
//
// All buildings are full, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the net change in employee transfers is zero. This means the number of employees leaving is equal to the number of employees moving in. For example if n = 3 and two employees are leaving building 0, one is leaving building 1, and one is leaving building 2, there should be two employees moving to building 0, one employee moving to building 1, and one employee moving to building 2.
//
// Return the maximum number of achievable requests.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]
// Output: 5
// Explantion: Let's see the requests:
// From building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.
// From building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.
// From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.
// From building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.
// From building 4 we don't have any requests.
// We can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.
// We can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 20
// 	1 <= requests.length <= 16
// 	requests[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= fromi, toi < n

// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
// - Bit manipulation (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When problems involve manipulating individual bits of numbers, representing sets as bitmasks, or optimizing operations on powers of two. It is also useful for certain combinatorics and dynamic programming problems.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators. This technique is often used to optimize computations, manage boolean flags efficiently, or represent subsets, typically achieving O(1) complexity for fixed-size integers.
//   • Invariants: Each bit in the mask accurately reflects the inclusion or exclusion status of its corresponding element.; Bitwise operations maintain the integrity of unaffected bits.
//   • Tips: Use (1 << k) to create a mask with the k-th bit set.; n & (n-1) clears the least significant set bit.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect operator precedence can lead to subtle bugs.; Mixing signed and unsigned integers in bitwise operations can yield unexpected results.
// - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, recursion, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when an exhaustive list of all subsets of a specific size K from a set of N items is required. It's suitable for problems needing to explore every possible configuration of K elements.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique subsets of size K from a set of N distinct elements, commonly employing recursion or bit manipulation. The typical time complexity is O(N choose K * K) for construction or O(N choose K) if just iterating.
//   • Invariants: The current partial combination always contains unique elements.; The number of elements chosen so far does not exceed K.
//   • Tips: Employ backtracking or recursion for a straightforward implementation.; Utilize bitmasks for efficient representation and generation, especially for smaller N.
//   • Pitfalls: Accidentally generating duplicate combinations if elements are not handled uniquely.; Failing to correctly define base cases or termination conditions for recursive calls.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
