// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-to-type-a-word-using-two-fingers/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You have a keyboard layout as shown above in the X-Y plane, where each English uppercase letter is located at some coordinate.
//
//
// 	For example, the letter 'A' is located at coordinate (0, 0), the letter 'B' is located at coordinate (0, 1), the letter 'P' is located at coordinate (2, 3) and the letter 'Z' is located at coordinate (4, 1).
//
//
// Given the string word, return the minimum total distance to type such string using only two fingers.
//
// The distance between coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.
//
// Note that the initial positions of your two fingers are considered free so do not count towards your total distance, also your two fingers do not have to start at the first letter or the first two letters.
//
// Example:
// Input: word = "CAKE"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "CAKE" is: 
// Finger 1 on letter 'C' -> cost = 0 
// Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'C' to letter 'A' = 2 
// Finger 2 on letter 'K' -> cost = 0 
// Finger 2 on letter 'E' -> cost = Distance from letter 'K' to letter 'E' = 1 
// Total distance = 3
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= word.length <= 300
// 	word consists of uppercase English letters.

// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
// - Manhattan Distance (geometry, number, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating distance between two points on a grid where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical directions. It is also useful for problems involving maximizing or minimizing sums of absolute coordinate differences, often transformable to Chebyshev distance.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance measures the sum of absolute differences of Cartesian coordinates between two points. It can be transformed into a Chebyshev distance problem by rotating coordinates, enabling efficient O(N) max/min distance calculations.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1=(x1, y1) and P2=(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is always non-negative.; The transformed points P1'=(x1+y1, y1-x1) and P2'=(x2+y2, y2-x2) satisfy Chebyshev(P1', P2') == Manhattan(P1, P2).
//   • Tips: Consider transforming to Chebyshev distance for max/min distance problems.; The transformation involves rotating coordinates: (x, y) -> (x+y, y-x).
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing with Euclidean distance, which allows diagonal movement.; Incorrectly applying coordinate transformation (e.g., wrong signs).
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
