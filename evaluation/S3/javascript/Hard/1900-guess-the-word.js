// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of unique strings words where words[i] is six letters long. One word of words was chosen as a secret word.
//
// You are also given the helper object Master. You may call Master.guess(word) where word is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from words. Master.guess(word) returns:
//
//
// 	-1 if word is not from words, or
// 	an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.
//
//
// There is a parameter allowedGuesses for each test case where allowedGuesses is the maximum number of times you can call Master.guess(word).
//
// For each test case, you should call Master.guess with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:
//
//
// 	"Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word." if you called Master.guess more than allowedGuesses times or if you did not call Master.guess with the secret word, or
// 	"You guessed the secret word correctly." if you called Master.guess with the secret word with the number of calls to Master.guess less than or equal to allowedGuesses.
//
//
// The test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).
//
// Example:
// Input: secret = "acckzz", words = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"], allowedGuesses = 10
// Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
// Explanation:
// master.guess("aaaaaa") returns -1, because "aaaaaa" is not in wordlist.
// master.guess("acckzz") returns 6, because "acckzz" is secret and has all 6 matches.
// master.guess("ccbazz") returns 3, because "ccbazz" has 3 matches.
// master.guess("eiowzz") returns 2, because "eiowzz" has 2 matches.
// master.guess("abcczz") returns 4, because "abcczz" has 4 matches.
// We made 5 calls to master.guess, and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 100
// 	words[i].length == 6
// 	words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
// 	All the strings of wordlist are unique.
// 	secret exists in words.
// 	10 <= allowedGuesses <= 30

// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compare strings or substrings quickly, reducing comparison time from linear to constant. It is ideal for problems requiring frequent string equality checks or pattern matching across large texts.
//   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to an integer hash value, allowing for O(1) equality checks between strings or substrings. This technique relies on a hash function where equal strings must produce equal hashes, though the reverse is not guaranteed.
//   • Invariants: The hash of any prefix s[0...i] is correctly computed based on s[0...i-1] and s[i].; All characters processed up to the current index i contribute to the current hash value.
//   • Tips: Use a polynomial rolling hash function with a prime base and a large prime modulus.; Employ double hashing (two different bases/moduli) to significantly reduce collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions: Different strings can produce the same hash, leading to false positives if not handled.; Poor choice of base or modulus can lead to more frequent collisions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
