// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-special-path-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an undirected tree rooted at node 0, with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, lengthi] indicates an edge between nodes ui and vi with length lengthi. You are also given an integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the value at node i.
//
// A special path is defined as a downward path from an ancestor node to a descendant node in which all node values are distinct, except for at most one value that may appear twice.
//
// Return an array result of size 2, where result[0] is the length of the longest special path, and result[1] is the minimum number of nodes in all possible longest special paths.
//
// Example:
// Input: edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,3],[1,3,1],[2,4,6],[4,7,2],[3,5,2],[3,6,5],[6,8,3]], nums = [1,1,0,3,1,2,1,1,0]
//
// Output: [9,3]
//
// Explanation:
//
// In the image below, nodes are colored by their corresponding values in nums.
//
//
//
// The longest special paths are 1 -> 2 -> 4 and 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 8, both having a length of 9. The minimum number of nodes across all longest special paths is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 5 * 104
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i].length == 3
// 	0 <= ui, vi < n
// 	1 <= lengthi <= 103
// 	nums.length == n
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104
// 	The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
// - Checking a graph for acyclicity and finding a cycle in O(M) (graph, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine if a graph contains any cycles or to identify one such cycle. It is applicable to both directed and undirected graphs.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses Depth First Search to detect cycles in a graph by tracking visited states of nodes during traversal. It runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently on the DFS recursion stack are marked as 'gray' (or equivalent).; All nodes fully explored and not part of the current path are marked as 'black' (or equivalent).
//   • Tips: For directed graphs, use a three-color scheme (white, gray, black) to distinguish states.; For undirected graphs, a simple visited array and checking against the immediate parent is sufficient.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the parent edge in undirected graphs can lead to false cycle detections.; Failing to distinguish between nodes currently in the recursion stack (gray) and fully processed nodes (black) in directed graphs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
