// Problem Description:
// You are given a positive integer primeFactors. You are asked to construct a positive integer n that satisfies the following conditions:
//
//
//   The number of prime factors of n (not necessarily distinct) is at most primeFactors.
//   The number of nice divisors of n is maximized. Note that a divisor of n is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of n. For example, if n = 12, then its prime factors are [2,2,3], then 6 and 12 are nice divisors, while 3 and 4 are not.
//
//
// Return the number of nice divisors of n. Since that number can be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number n is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals n.
//
// Example:
// Input: primeFactors = 5
// Output: 6
// Explanation: 200 is a valid value of n.
// It has 5 prime factors: [2,2,2,5,5], and it has 6 nice divisors: [10,20,40,50,100,200].
// There is not other value of n that has at most 5 prime factors and more nice divisors.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= primeFactors <= 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer, typically by leveraging its prime factorization.
//   • Idea: The number of divisors d(n) and sum of divisors sigma(n) are arithmetic functions derived from the prime factorization of an integer n. Both can be computed efficiently by first finding prime factors and their exponents, resulting in an O(sqrt(N)) or O(log N) complexity with precomputed primes.
//   • Invariants: The current count of divisors is the product of (exponent + 1) for all prime factors found so far.; The current sum of divisors is the product of (1 + p + ... + p^e) for all prime factors found so far.
//   • Tips: Precompute primes using a sieve for efficiency when dealing with multiple queries or large numbers.; For sum of divisors, the formula is sigma(n) = product((1 + p_i + ... + p_i^e_i)) for each prime factor p_i^e_i.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle n=1 correctly, which has one divisor.; Integer overflow when calculating sums or products of large powers, especially for sum of divisors.
// - Number of divisors / sum of divisors (number, counting, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to efficiently calculate the total count or sum of all positive divisors for a given integer. It is applicable in number theory problems or combinatorial tasks involving factors.
//   • Idea: This method computes the number of divisors and sum of divisors of an integer n by first finding its prime factorization. The core idea leverages properties of multiplicative functions, with a typical complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for factorization.
//   • Invariants: During prime factorization, temp_n always holds the remaining unfactored part of the original number.; The current_prime_factor iterates through potential prime divisors in increasing order.
//   • Tips: First find the prime factorization n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak.; Number of divisors d(n) = (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the special case of n=1 (1 divisor, sum 1).; Incorrectly calculating powers or sums, especially for large exponents.
// - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem can be solved by making the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping this leads to a globally optimal solution. This strategy is often simpler and faster than dynamic programming.
//   • Idea: The greedy algorithm makes the best choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum, without reconsidering previous choices. Its time complexity is typically O(N log N) or O(N).
//   • Invariants: At each step, the chosen element is the best available according to the greedy criterion.; The partial solution constructed so far remains optimal for the subproblem considered.
//   • Tips: Prove correctness by exchange argument or induction.; Sort input data if it helps identify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to prove the greedy choice property.; Making a locally optimal choice that prevents a global optimum.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
