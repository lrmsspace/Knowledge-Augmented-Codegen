// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-all-tasks/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a computer that can run an unlimited number of tasks at the same time. You are given a 2D integer array tasks where tasks[i] = [starti, endi, durationi] indicates that the ith task should run for a total of durationi seconds (not necessarily continuous) within the inclusive time range [starti, endi].
//
// You may turn on the computer only when it needs to run a task. You can also turn it off if it is idle.
//
// Return the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks.
//
// Example:
// Input: tasks = [[2,3,1],[4,5,1],[1,5,2]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 
// - The first task can be run in the inclusive time range [2, 2].
// - The second task can be run in the inclusive time range [5, 5].
// - The third task can be run in the two inclusive time ranges [2, 2] and [5, 5].
// The computer will be on for a total of 2 seconds.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= tasks.length <= 2000
// 	tasks[i].length == 3
// 	1 <= starti, endi <= 2000
// 	1 <= durationi <= endi - starti + 1

// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when tasks with associated processing times and costs need to be sequenced on a single machine to minimize a total objective function, typically involving weighted completion times or penalties. The optimal sequence is found by a greedy sort.
//   • Idea: This method finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine by sorting them according to a greedy criterion derived from an exchange argument. It achieves an optimal solution with O(N log N) time complexity, dominated by the sorting step.
//   • Invariants: The relative order of any two jobs i and j in the sorted sequence is consistent with the greedy comparison rule.; Any prefix of the sorted schedule represents an optimal ordering for the jobs within that prefix.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the objective function to be minimized.; Formulate the greedy sorting rule using an exchange argument for any two adjacent jobs.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly deriving the greedy comparison criterion.; Applying this method to problems with multiple machines or complex precedence constraints without adaptation.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: When tasks need to be processed sequentially on a single resource to optimize a cumulative metric like total completion time or weighted sum of completion times.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal sequence for processing jobs on a single machine by applying a greedy strategy, often involving sorting based on specific criteria. It typically achieves an optimal schedule in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The list of jobs is sorted according to the chosen greedy criterion.; For any prefix of the sorted jobs, the current schedule minimizes the objective function for those jobs.
//   • Tips: Identify the correct sorting key (e.g., processing time, weight/time ratio) for the objective function.; Prove optimality using an exchange argument to justify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying an incorrect sorting criterion for the specific optimization objective.; Assuming a greedy approach is always optimal without a formal proof.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine to minimize the total weighted completion time, where each job has a processing time and a linear penalty coefficient.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine with linear penalty functions by sorting jobs based on a specific ratio. It achieves an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The partial schedule constructed so far is optimal for the jobs included.; For any two adjacent jobs 'j' and 'k' in the final schedule, if 'j' precedes 'k', then 'c_j/t_j >= c_k/t_k'.
//   • Tips: Derive the sorting criterion using an exchange argument for adjacent jobs.; The optimal order is determined by the ratio of cost coefficient to processing time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the sorting criterion, especially the ratio order.; Overlooking edge cases like zero processing times or zero penalty coefficients.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
