// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-laser-beams-in-a-bank/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a 0-indexed binary string array bank representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. bank[i] represents the ith row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while'1' means the cell has a security device.
//
// There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:
//
//
// 	The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 < r2.
// 	For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.
//
//
// Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.
//
// Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.
//
// Example:
// Input: bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]
// Output: 8
// Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
//  * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
//  * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
//  * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]
//  * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][3]
//  * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
//  * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
//  * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
//  * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
// Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
// This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.
//
// Constraints:
// m == bank.length
// 	n == bank[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 500
// 	bank[i][j] is either '0' or '1'.

// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: When finding the maximum rectangular subregion consisting of only zeros in a binary matrix, often by transforming rows into histogram problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the largest rectangular submatrix containing only zeros by precomputing heights of consecutive zeros for each column and then applying a largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row. It has a time complexity of O(rows * cols).
//   • Invariants: After processing row `i`, `heights[j]` accurately represents the count of consecutive zeros ending at `(i, j)` in column `j`.; The `max_area` variable correctly stores the largest rectangular area of zeros found in any submatrix from rows `0` to `i`.
//   • Tips: Transform the 2D problem into a series of 1D histogram problems, one for each row.; Precompute the height of consecutive zeros ending at each cell in each column.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the height array, especially at row boundaries or when encountering '1's.; Off-by-one errors when calculating rectangle areas in the histogram step.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
