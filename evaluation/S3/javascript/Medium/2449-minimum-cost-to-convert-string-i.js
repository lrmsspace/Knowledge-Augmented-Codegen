// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-convert-string-i/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].
//
// You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.
//
// Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.
//
// Note that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].
//
// Example:
// Input: source = "abcd", target = "acbe", original = ["a","b","c","c","e","d"], changed = ["b","c","b","e","b","e"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]
// Output: 28
// Explanation: To convert the string "abcd" to string "acbe":
// - Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.
// - Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.
// - Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.
// - Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.
// The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.
// It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= source.length == target.length <= 105
// 	source, target consist of lowercase English letters.
// 	1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000
// 	original[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.
// 	1 <= cost[i] <= 106
// 	original[i] != changed[i]

// - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the shortest paths between all possible pairs of vertices in a graph. It is particularly suitable for dense graphs or when negative edge weights are present, as long as no negative cycles are reachable.
//   • Idea: Floyd-Warshall is a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It iteratively considers all possible intermediate vertices to update path distances, achieving an O(V^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After the k-th iteration, dist[i][j] contains the shortest path from i to j considering only vertices 0 to k-1 as intermediate nodes.; For any pair (i, j), dist[i][j] is always greater than or equal to the true shortest path distance from i to j (or infinity if unreachable).
//   • Tips: Initialize distances: direct edge weights, infinity for no direct edge, zero for self-loops.; The outermost loop must iterate through intermediate vertices (k).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect loop order (k not outermost) leads to incorrect results.; Integer overflow with large path sums if not using appropriate data types.
// - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (graph, matrix, floyd-warshall, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, especially if negative edge weights are present but no negative cycles.
//   • Idea: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming approach that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It iteratively considers all possible intermediate vertices to update path lengths, achieving an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, d[i][j] stores the shortest path from i to j using only vertices {1, ..., k} as intermediate nodes.; d[i][j] always represents a valid path length or infinity, never an invalid negative value unless a negative cycle is detected.
//   • Tips: Initialize direct edge weights and infinity for non-existent edges.; Set distance from a vertex to itself to zero initially.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect loop order (k must be outermost) will yield incorrect results.; Improper handling of 'infinity' values can lead to overflow or incorrect comparisons.
// - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (matrix, graph, recursion, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It is suitable for graphs with negative edge weights but no negative cycles.
//   • Idea: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm finds all-pairs shortest paths in a weighted graph using dynamic programming. It iteratively considers all possible intermediate vertices, updating path lengths in O(V^3) time.
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, dist[i][j] contains the shortest path from i to j using only vertices 0 to k-1 as intermediate nodes.; dist[i][j] is always non-increasing with each iteration of k.
//   • Tips: Initialize distances with edge weights or infinity, and 0 for self-loops.; The outermost loop iterates through intermediate vertices (k).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling infinity values, especially with negative weights (e.g., infinity - 1).; Not checking for negative cycles, which can lead to incorrect shortest path values.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
