// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-cutting-cake-i/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There is an m x n cake that needs to be cut into 1 x 1 pieces.
//
// You are given integers m, n, and two arrays:
//
//
// 	horizontalCut of size m - 1, where horizontalCut[i] represents the cost to cut along the horizontal line i.
// 	verticalCut of size n - 1, where verticalCut[j] represents the cost to cut along the vertical line j.
//
//
// In one operation, you can choose any piece of cake that is not yet a 1 x 1 square and perform one of the following cuts:
//
//
// 	Cut along a horizontal line i at a cost of horizontalCut[i].
// 	Cut along a vertical line j at a cost of verticalCut[j].
//
//
// After the cut, the piece of cake is divided into two distinct pieces.
//
// The cost of a cut depends only on the initial cost of the line and does not change.
//
// Return the minimum total cost to cut the entire cake into 1 x 1 pieces.
//
// Example:
// Input: m = 3, n = 2, horizontalCut = [1,3], verticalCut = [5]
//
// Output: 13
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
//
// 	Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 with cost 5, current total cost is 5.
// 	Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 on 3 x 1 subgrid with cost 1.
// 	Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 on 3 x 1 subgrid with cost 1.
// 	Perform a cut on the horizontal line 1 on 2 x 1 subgrid with cost 3.
// 	Perform a cut on the horizontal line 1 on 2 x 1 subgrid with cost 3.
//
//
// The total cost is 5 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 13.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= m, n <= 20
// 	horizontalCut.length == m - 1
// 	verticalCut.length == n - 1
// 	1 <= horizontalCut[i], verticalCut[i] <= 103

// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when tasks with associated processing times and costs need to be sequenced on a single machine to minimize a total objective function, typically involving weighted completion times or penalties. The optimal sequence is found by a greedy sort.
//   • Idea: This method finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine by sorting them according to a greedy criterion derived from an exchange argument. It achieves an optimal solution with O(N log N) time complexity, dominated by the sorting step.
//   • Invariants: The relative order of any two jobs i and j in the sorted sequence is consistent with the greedy comparison rule.; Any prefix of the sorted schedule represents an optimal ordering for the jobs within that prefix.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the objective function to be minimized.; Formulate the greedy sorting rule using an exchange argument for any two adjacent jobs.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly deriving the greedy comparison criterion.; Applying this method to problems with multiple machines or complex precedence constraints without adaptation.
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
//   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
//   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
