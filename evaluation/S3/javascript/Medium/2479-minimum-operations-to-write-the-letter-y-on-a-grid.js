// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-write-the-letter-y-on-a-grid/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed n x n grid where n is odd, and grid[r][c] is 0, 1, or 2.
//
// We say that a cell belongs to the Letter Y if it belongs to one of the following:
//
//
// 	The diagonal starting at the top-left cell and ending at the center cell of the grid.
// 	The diagonal starting at the top-right cell and ending at the center cell of the grid.
// 	The vertical line starting at the center cell and ending at the bottom border of the grid.
//
//
// The Letter Y is written on the grid if and only if:
//
//
// 	All values at cells belonging to the Y are equal.
// 	All values at cells not belonging to the Y are equal.
// 	The values at cells belonging to the Y are different from the values at cells not belonging to the Y.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of operations needed to write the letter Y on the grid given that in one operation you can change the value at any cell to 0, 1, or 2.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,2,2],[1,1,0],[0,1,0]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can write Y on the grid by applying the changes highlighted in blue in the image above. After the operations, all cells that belong to Y, denoted in bold, have the same value of 1 while those that do not belong to Y are equal to 0.
// It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed to write Y on the grid.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= n <= 49 
// 	n == grid.length == grid[i].length
// 	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 2
// 	n is odd.

// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, counting, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when counting non-attacking piece placements on a grid, especially when the problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems based on board properties like diagonals.
//   • Idea: This algorithm employs 2D dynamic programming to count the total number of ways to place non-attacking bishops on a chessboard. It leverages the independence of placements on black and white squares/diagonals, achieving a polynomial time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any diagonal `i`, `D[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonal `i`.; Bishops placed on black diagonals do not attack bishops placed on white diagonals.
//   • Tips: Decompose the problem into independent subproblems for black and white squares/diagonals.; Identify the state for DP, typically `dp[diagonal_index][bishops_placed]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the number of squares on each diagonal.; Overlapping bishops if diagonal definitions are not precise.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
//   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
//   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.
// - 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution (matrix, number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this to quickly determine if a given 15-puzzle board configuration can be solved, avoiding exhaustive search. It's applicable when the goal is to check solvability rather than finding the solution path.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the solvability of a 15-puzzle configuration by analyzing the parity of inversions in the tile permutation and the blank tile's row. It involves counting inversions, which typically takes O(N^2) time for N tiles, or O(N log N) with a more advanced counting method.
//   • Invariants: The permutation used for inversion counting always excludes the blank tile.; Each pair of tiles (i, j) with i < j is considered exactly once for inversion counting.
//   • Tips: Remember to exclude the blank tile (0) when forming the permutation for inversion counting.; For a 4x4 grid, the blank tile's row (from bottom, 1-indexed) is crucial for the parity check.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly including the blank tile (0) in the inversion count.; Miscalculating the blank tile's row index (e.g., 0-indexed from top vs. 1-indexed from bottom).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
