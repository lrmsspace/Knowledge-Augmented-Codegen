// Problem Description:
// Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.
//
// If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses
//
// If multiple answers are possible, return any of them.
//
// It is guaranteed that the length of the answer string is less than 104 for all the given inputs.
//
// Note that if the fraction can be represented as a finite length string, you must return it.
//
// Example:
// Input: numerator = 1, denominator = 2
// Output: "0.5"
//
// Constraints:
// -231 <= numerator, denominator <= 231 - 1
// 	denominator != 0
//

// - The Stern-Brocot tree and Farey sequences (number, tree, binary-search, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this when representing positive rational numbers as unique paths in a binary tree or when efficiently approximating irrational numbers. It's ideal for finding a fraction's path or its position within ordered sequences.
//   • Idea: The Stern-Brocot tree uniquely maps every positive rational number to a binary path, constructed by repeatedly taking mediants. This allows for efficient search and representation of fractions with O(log(p+q)) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The target fraction p/q always lies strictly between the current left boundary pL/qL and right boundary pR/qR.; The current left and right boundary fractions (pL/qL, pR/qR) are always adjacent terms in some Farey sequence.
//   • Tips: Initialize search boundaries with 0/1 and 1/0 (or 1/1 for positive fractions).; Calculate the mediant (pL+pR)/(qL+qR) to determine the next candidate fraction.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive O(p+q) search without run-length encoding can be too slow for large fractions.; Incorrectly handling initial boundary conditions (e.g., 0/1, 1/0, 1/1).
// - Extended Euclidean Algorithm (number, gcd, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find integer coefficients x and y that satisfy Bézout's identity (ax + by = gcd(a,b)). It is also essential for computing modular multiplicative inverses and solving linear Diophantine equations.
//   • Idea: The Extended Euclidean Algorithm computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers 'a' and 'b', and simultaneously finds integer coefficients 'x' and 'y' such that 'ax + by = gcd(a,b)'. It operates in O(log(min(a,b))) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: x * (initial a) + y * (initial b) = current_a_value; x_1 * (initial a) + y_1 * (initial b) = current_b_value
//   • Tips: Can be implemented using either a recursive or an iterative approach.; The algorithm correctly handles negative integer inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases in recursive implementations can lead to errors.; Potential for integer overflow if coefficients x or y become extremely large, though uncommon.
// - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
//   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
//   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
