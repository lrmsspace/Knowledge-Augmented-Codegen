// Problem Description:
// Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3
// Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 8
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total number of valid arrangements of opening and closing brackets, ensuring all pairs are matched and correctly nested. It applies to combinatorial problems requiring structured pairing.
//   • Idea: This technique counts the number of ways to form sequences of opening and closing brackets such that they are balanced and properly nested. It is a classic combinatorial problem, typically solved in O(N) or O(N^2) time.
//   • Invariants: At any point in sequence construction, the count of open brackets placed must be greater than or equal to the count of closed brackets placed.; The total number of open brackets in a complete valid sequence must exactly equal the total number of closed brackets.
//   • Tips: Recognize the connection to Catalan numbers for common variations (e.g., N pairs of parentheses).; Dynamic programming can solve more complex variations with different bracket types or constraints.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the 'prefix sum' condition: the count of open brackets must always be greater than or equal to close brackets at any point.; Incorrectly applying Catalan numbers to problems with additional constraints or different bracket types.
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: When asked to count the total number of valid or well-formed bracket sequences of a certain length or with a specific number of pairs. This often involves combinatorial reasoning or dynamic programming.
//   • Idea: Counts the total number of valid bracket sequences of a given length or with a specific number of pairs, where each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. This problem often has a combinatorial solution, typically involving Catalan numbers, with a time complexity of O(N) or O(N^2) for DP.
//   • Invariants: At any prefix of the sequence, the number of open brackets is greater than or equal to the number of closing brackets.; The total number of open brackets in the sequence equals the total number of closing brackets.
//   • Tips: Recognize the pattern for Catalan numbers if applicable.; Dynamic programming can be used for more complex variations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the balance constraint (open count >= close count).; Overcounting or undercounting sequences.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, array, backtracking, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find all possible ways to break down a string into parts, where each part must satisfy a specific property. It is suitable for generating all combinations or permutations with constraints.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively explores all possible ways to partition a string into substrings, ensuring each substring is a palindrome. It employs a backtracking approach to build valid partitions incrementally, typically resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each recursive call, the 'step' list contains a valid palindrome partition for the string segment processed so far.; The current processing index (or remaining string) always points to the unpartitioned suffix of the original input string.
//   • Tips: Utilize a helper function to manage additional state, such as the current partition path and the overall result list.; Pass the remaining string or a start index to recursive calls to define the subproblem for subsequent partitioning.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to create a new copy of the current partition path before adding it to the final result list, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly defining the base case for recursion, which can cause infinite loops or missed valid partitions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
