// Problem Description:
// Solve a given equation and return the value of 'x' in the form of a string "x=#value". The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable 'x' and its coefficient. You should return "No solution" if there is no solution for the equation, or "Infinite solutions" if there are infinite solutions for the equation.
//
// If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of 'x' is an integer.
//
// Example:
// Input: equation = "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"
// Output: "x=2"
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= equation.length <= 1000
// 	equation has exactly one '='.
// 	equation consists of integers with an absolute value in the range [0, 100] without any leading zeros, and the variable 'x'.
// 	The input is generated that if there is a single solution, it will be an integer.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to evaluate expressions given in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation) to compute their final numerical value.
//   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an expression in Reverse Polish Notation by processing elements sequentially. Numbers are pushed onto a stack, and operators pop two operands, compute, and push the result.
//   • Invariants: The stack always contains only numbers (operands or intermediate results).; For a valid RPN expression, the stack will have at least two elements when an operator is processed.
//   • Tips: Process the RPN expression from left to right, token by token.; Push numerical operands directly onto the stack.
//   • Pitfalls: Attempting to pop from an empty stack when an operator is encountered, indicating an invalid RPN expression.; Incorrect order of operands for non-commutative operations like subtraction or division.
// - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
//   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
//   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
// - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to evaluate an arithmetic expression given in infix notation, respecting operator precedence and parentheses. It is suitable for expressions with binary, left-associative operators.
//   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an infix arithmetic expression using two stacks: one for operands and one for operators. It processes the expression from left to right, applying operator precedence and associativity rules to achieve an O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The operand stack always contains valid numerical values or intermediate results.; The operator stack maintains operators such that operators with higher or equal precedence are processed before lower precedence ones.
//   • Tips: Clearly define operator precedence and associativity rules for all operators.; Use a separate stack for operands (numbers) and operators (including parentheses).
//   • Pitfalls: Misinterpreting operator precedence or associativity rules can lead to incorrect results.; Failure to handle mismatched or unbalanced parentheses can cause runtime errors.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
