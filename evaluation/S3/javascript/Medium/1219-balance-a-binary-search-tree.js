// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/balance-a-binary-search-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the same node values. If there is more than one answer, return any of them.
//
// A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]
// Output: [2,1,3,null,null,null,4]
// Explanation: This is not the only correct answer, [3,1,4,null,2] is also correct.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// 	1 <= Node.val <= 105

// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to store ordered data in a hierarchical structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change while maintaining sorted order.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node has a key, and all keys in the left subtree are less than the node's key, while all keys in the right subtree are greater. Basic operations like search, insertion, and deletion typically have an average time complexity of O(log N) but can degrade to O(N) in the worst case.
//   • Invariants: For every node N, if L is in N's left subtree, then L.key < N.key.; For every node N, if R is in N's right subtree, then R.key > N.key.
//   • Tips: Understand the recursive definition for traversal and operations.; Handle edge cases like empty tree, single node, or leaf nodes carefully.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can lead to O(N) worst-case performance for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can lead to data loss or incorrect structure.
// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to store ordered data that allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion while maintaining sorted order. It's suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(log N) average time and O(N) worst-case.
//   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than its key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than its key.
//   • Tips: Maintain the BST property: left child < parent < right child.; Recursion simplifies many operations like search, insert, and traversal.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade performance to O(N) for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can break BST properties or lead to data loss.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, binary-lifting, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use binary lifting when you need to answer multiple Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries or ancestor relationship checks efficiently on a static tree.
//   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestor pointers using DFS to answer Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries and ancestor checks in O(log N) time per query, after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` and power `k`, `up[u][k]` is the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; `depth[u]` correctly represents the distance from the root to node `u`.
//   • Tips: Precompute `up[u][k]` as the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; Use DFS to fill the `up` array and node depths.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating `log N` for array dimensions.; Failing to handle the root node's ancestors (e.g., `up[root][k]` should be itself or an invalid node).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
