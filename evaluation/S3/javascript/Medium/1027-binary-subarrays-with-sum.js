//
// Problem Description:
// Given a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal.
//
// A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
// [1,0,1,0,1]
// [1,0,1,0,1]
// [1,0,1,0,1]
// [1,0,1,0,1]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
// 	nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
// 	0 <= goal <= nums.length
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It is ideal for scenarios requiring both fast query and update operations on an array.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is an array-based data structure that efficiently calculates prefix sums and updates individual elements in an array. It supports both point updates and prefix sum queries in O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each `T[i]` stores the sum of a specific range `[g(i), i]` from the original array.; The `sum(idx)` function correctly aggregates values from `A[0]` to `A[idx]`.
//   • Tips: Understand the bit manipulation (`i & -i`) for navigating parent/child relationships.; Consistently choose and apply either 0-based or 1-based indexing throughout the implementation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0-based versus 1-based indexing can lead to off-by-one errors.; Forgetting to initialize the tree or performing updates incorrectly will yield wrong results.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
