// Problem Description:
// Given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in nums.
//
// Note that:
//
//
// 	A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
// 	A sequence seq is arithmetic if seq[i + 1] - seq[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,6,9,12]
// Output: 4
// Explanation:  The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 1000
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 500
//

// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal ordering of non-contiguous elements.
//   • Idea: This DP approach calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in an array. It builds upon previously computed subsequence lengths, resulting in an O(N^2) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] stores the length of the LIS ending at index i.; For any j < i, if A[j] < A[i], then dp[j] + 1 is a candidate length for dp[i].
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element itself forms an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling the strict increasing condition (e.g., allowing equality).
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, coordinate-compress, segment-tree, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements must be strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal substructure on sequences with an increasing property.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are in increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree with coordinate compression.
//   • Invariants: The `dp` array (or segment tree) stores information about the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The `dp` array, if used, remains sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) solution uses a `dp` array storing the smallest ending element for all increasing subsequences of a given length.; Binary search (`lower_bound`) efficiently finds the correct position to update in the `dp` array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates; LIS typically requires strictly increasing elements.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
