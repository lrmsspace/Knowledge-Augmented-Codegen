// Problem Description:
// There is only one character 'A' on the screen of a notepad. You can perform one of two operations on this notepad for each step:
//
//
// 	Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).
// 	Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
//
//
// Given an integer n, return the minimum number of operations to get the character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Initially, we have one character 'A'.
// In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
// In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
// In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 1000

// - Fibonacci Numbers (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use this when calculating the n-th Fibonacci number or similar sequences where each term depends on a fixed number of preceding terms. It efficiently avoids redundant computations for moderate 'n' values.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates Fibonacci numbers iteratively by storing previously computed values in an array, building up to the desired n-th term. This approach achieves O(N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] correctly stores the i-th Fibonacci number.; For i >= 2, dp[i] is computed as the sum of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2].
//   • Tips: Initialize base cases (F0, F1) correctly to start the sequence.; Use an array or two variables to store only the necessary previous terms.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the base cases can lead to wrong results.; A naive recursive solution without memoization will lead to exponential time complexity.
// - Introduction to Dynamic Programming (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When a problem can be broken down into smaller, overlapping subproblems and an optimal solution to the larger problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems. It's suitable for optimizing recursive solutions with repeated computations.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming (DP) solves complex problems by breaking them into simpler overlapping subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant computations. It typically achieves polynomial time complexity, often O(N) or O(N^2) for 1D DP, by trading space for time.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] stores the optimal solution for the subproblem ending at index i.; All dp[j] for j < i have been correctly computed before dp[i] is calculated.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the DP state and its meaning.; Identify the base cases for the recurrence relation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the DP state or recurrence relation.; Missing or incorrect base cases leading to infinite recursion or wrong results.
// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
//   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
