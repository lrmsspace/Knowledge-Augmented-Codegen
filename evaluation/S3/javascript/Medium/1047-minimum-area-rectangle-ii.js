// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-area-rectangle-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of points in the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi].
//
// Return the minimum area of any rectangle formed from these points, with sides not necessarily parallel to the X and Y axes. If there is not any such rectangle, return 0.
//
// Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
//
// Example:
// Input: points = [[1,2],[2,1],[1,0],[0,1]]
// Output: 2.00000
// Explanation: The minimum area rectangle occurs at [1,2],[2,1],[1,0],[0,1], with an area of 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= points.length <= 50
// 	points[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= xi, yi <= 4 * 104
// 	All the given points are unique.

// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
// - Finding the equation of a line for a segment (geometry, number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks to count or list all possible combinations, permutations, or arrangements of elements. It's suitable when a brute-force check of all possibilities is feasible.
//   • Idea: Enumeration systematically generates and examines all possible solutions to a problem. This approach guarantees finding the correct answer if one exists, typically with exponential time complexity O(k^N) or O(N!).
//   • Invariants: At each step, the current partial solution is valid according to problem constraints.; All previously explored partial solutions have been processed or discarded.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space and the properties of valid solutions.; Use recursion or iterative loops to explore all branches of the solution space.
//   • Pitfalls: Overlooking edge cases or constraints that limit the search space.; Generating duplicate solutions if not handled carefully.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, counting, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when counting non-attacking piece placements on a grid, especially when the problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems based on board properties like diagonals.
//   • Idea: This algorithm employs 2D dynamic programming to count the total number of ways to place non-attacking bishops on a chessboard. It leverages the independence of placements on black and white squares/diagonals, achieving a polynomial time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any diagonal `i`, `D[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonal `i`.; Bishops placed on black diagonals do not attack bishops placed on white diagonals.
//   • Tips: Decompose the problem into independent subproblems for black and white squares/diagonals.; Identify the state for DP, typically `dp[diagonal_index][bishops_placed]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the number of squares on each diagonal.; Overlapping bishops if diagonal definitions are not precise.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
