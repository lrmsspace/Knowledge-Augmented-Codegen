//
// Problem Description:
// Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
//
// Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
//
// Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
//
//
// class Node {
//     public int val;
//     public List<Node> neighbors;
// }
//
//
//  
//
// Test case format:
//
// For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
//
// An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
//
// The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
//
// Example:
// Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
// Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
// Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
// 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
// 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
// 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
// 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
// 	1 <= Node.val <= 100
// 	Node.val is unique for each node.
// 	There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
// 	The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Undirected Graphs (graph, array, simulation)
//   • When to use: When modeling symmetric relationships between entities and needing to explore, analyze connectivity, or find paths within the network. Useful for problems involving reachability or structural properties.
//   • Idea: Undirected graphs represent symmetric relationships between pairs of vertices. Simulation on them involves systematically exploring or processing these connections, often with O(V+E) complexity for basic traversals.
//   • Invariants: All vertices reachable from the source within 'k' edges have been processed by the 'k'-th step of BFS.; Each edge in the graph is traversed at most twice (once for each direction) during a full graph traversal.
//   • Tips: Use an adjacency list for sparse graphs to optimize space and traversal time.; Use an adjacency matrix for dense graphs or when O(1) edge existence checks are critical.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected components, leading to incomplete graph processing.; Incorrectly representing undirected edges (e.g., only adding one direction to an adjacency list).
// - Check whether a graph is bipartite (graph, queue, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to determine if an undirected graph can be divided into two independent sets such that all edges connect vertices from different sets, or if it is two-colorable.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if an undirected graph is bipartite by attempting to 2-color it using BFS. It assigns alternating colors (or sets) to adjacent vertices, detecting non-bipartite conditions if an edge connects two vertices of the same color.
//   • Invariants: All visited vertices within the current BFS component are correctly 2-colored.; All edges processed so far connect vertices of different colors.
//   • Tips: Use two distinct colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to represent the two sets.; Iterate through all vertices and start a new BFS from any unvisited vertex to handle disconnected components.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected graphs by ensuring all vertices are visited.; Incorrectly assigning colors, leading to false positives or negatives.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, queue, array, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) from a source node to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph. It is also suitable for exploring a graph layer by layer.
//   • Idea: BFS systematically explores a graph level by level, starting from a source node, ensuring all nodes at a given distance are visited before moving to the next distance level. It operates in O(N + M) time for N vertices and M edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or adjacent distance level from the source.; The 'used' array accurately reflects all nodes that have been added to the queue for processing.
//   • Tips: Always use a queue to maintain the order of nodes to visit.; Utilize a 'visited' array or set to prevent revisiting nodes and infinite loops.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not find shortest paths in weighted graphs unless weights are 0 or 1 (use Dijkstra for general weighted graphs).; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to incorrect results or TLE.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
