// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.
//
// A subtree of a node node is node plus every node that is a descendant of node.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,null,0,0,1]
// Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
// Explanation: 
// Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
// The diagram on the right represents the answer.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 200].
// 	Node.val is either 0 or 1.

// - Deleting from a data structure in_log_n (ds, segment-tree, dfs, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when processing a sequence of additions, deletions, and queries offline, where elements have specific time intervals of existence. It efficiently handles dynamic data structure operations by leveraging a segment tree over time.
//   • Idea: This technique uses a segment tree over the timeline of queries to manage elements with varying lifespans. Queries are processed offline via DFS, adding elements upon entering a node and undoing additions upon exiting, achieving O(T(n) log n) deletion complexity.
//   • Invariants: When entering a segment tree node, all elements associated with that node's time range are added to the active data structure.; When exiting a segment tree node, all elements added upon entry are removed, restoring the data structure to its state before entering.
//   • Tips: Ensure the base data structure supports efficient addition and undo operations.; Carefully manage element additions and removals during DFS traversal.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to undo changes when backtracking from a segment tree node.; Incorrectly mapping element lifespans to segment tree nodes.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
