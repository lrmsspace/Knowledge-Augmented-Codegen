//
// Problem Description:
// You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.
//
// A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.
//
// Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
//
// Example:
// Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
// This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// rows == heights.length
// 	columns == heights[i].length
// 	1 <= rows, columns <= 100
// 	1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When searching for a specific element in a sorted collection or finding an optimal value over a monotonic function within a defined range. It efficiently reduces the search space by half in each step.
//   • Idea: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or determines a value that satisfies a monotonic predicate. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The potential answer always lies within the current search interval `[low, high]`.; All elements strictly less than `low` have been determined not to be the answer.
//   • Tips: Ensure the search space exhibits a monotonic property.; Carefully define the `low` and `high` bounds for the search interval.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating `low` or `high` bounds leading to infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing or loop conditions.
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing a unimodal function (finding its maximum or minimum) over a continuous interval, where direct differentiation is hard or impossible.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a given interval by repeatedly narrowing the search space. It evaluates the function at two internal points to achieve logarithmic convergence.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function f(x) is always within the current interval [l, r].; The function f(x) remains unimodal within the current interval [l, r].
//   • Tips: Use a fixed number of iterations as a stopping criterion instead of an epsilon value for robustness against floating point errors.; For golden section search, reuse one function evaluation from the previous step to minimize expensive computations.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying this algorithm to a non-unimodal function will yield an incorrect result.; Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect comparisons or infinite loops if `eps` is too small.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
