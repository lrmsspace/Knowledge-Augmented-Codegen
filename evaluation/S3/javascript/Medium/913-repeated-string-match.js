//
// Problem Description:
// Given two strings a and b, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string a so that string b is a substring of it. If it is impossible for b​​​​​​ to be a substring of a after repeating it, return -1.
//
// Notice: string "abc" repeated 0 times is "", repeated 1 time is "abc" and repeated 2 times is "abcabc".
//
// Example:
// Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We return 3 because by repeating a three times "abcdabcdabcd", b is a substring of it.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
// 	a and b consist of lowercase English letters.

// - Substring Search (string, array, kmp, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern within a larger text, especially when the pattern might have repeating or overlapping prefixes.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that avoids re-scanning characters in the text by pre-processing the pattern to build a 'longest proper prefix suffix' (LPS) array. It achieves optimal O(N + M) time complexity, where N is the text length and M is the pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `j` pointer always indicates the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `text[0...i-1]`.; The `lps[j]` value stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...j-1]`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the LPS array (also known as failure function or border array) for the pattern.; The LPS array helps determine the next best match position after a mismatch, avoiding redundant comparisons.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the LPS array can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors when indexing the pattern or text are common.
// - Substring Search (string, array, kmp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern string within a larger text string efficiently. It is particularly useful when the pattern might have significant self-overlapping prefixes and suffixes, allowing for linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently searches for occurrences of a pattern within a text by avoiding redundant comparisons. It preprocesses the pattern to build a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) or Longest Proper Prefix Suffix (LPS) array, achieving O(N + M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: During DFA construction, dfa[c][j] correctly stores the next state if character c is encountered in state j.; During DFA construction, x maintains the length of the longest proper prefix of pattern[0...j-1] that is also a suffix of pattern[0...j-1].
//   • Tips: Precompute the LPS array or DFA for the pattern to guide the search.; The LPS array indicates the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix, enabling efficient shifts.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect construction of the LPS array or DFA is a common source of errors.; High constant factors for small alphabets or short patterns might make simpler algorithms faster.
// - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
