// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.
//
// A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.
//
//
// 	For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".
//
//
// A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.
//
// Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
//
// Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 104
// 	1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10
// 	words1[i] and words2[i] consist only of lowercase English letters.
// 	All the strings of words1 are unique.

// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - String Sorts (array, string, number, radix-sort, counting-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting a large collection of fixed-length strings or integers, especially when the key range (alphabet size) is small. It is efficient for data with uniform key lengths.
//   • Idea: LSD Radix Sort sorts elements by processing digits or characters from the least significant to the most significant, using a stable counting sort for each position. It achieves a time complexity of O(W * (N + R)), where W is the key length, N is the number of items, and R is the radix.
//   • Invariants: After each pass 'd' (from 'w-1' down to '0'), the array 'a' is stably sorted based on characters from position 'd' to 'w-1'.; The 'count' array accurately reflects the frequency of each character at the current digit 'd' before cumulation.
//   • Tips: Utilize counting sort as the stable inner sorting algorithm for each digit pass.; Process characters or digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for variable-length strings without proper padding or specialized handling.; Can be slower than comparison sorts for small input sizes or very large radix (R).
// - Suffix Array (string, array, counting-sort, radix-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently query or analyze all suffixes of a string, often for pattern matching, string searching, or finding repeated substrings. It provides a sorted order of all suffixes.
//   • Idea: The Suffix Array algorithm constructs an array containing the starting indices of all suffixes of a string, sorted lexicographically. It typically uses a doubling strategy with counting sort or radix sort in each step, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After iteration k, p contains the sorted indices of all cyclic substrings of length 2^k.; After iteration k, c[i] represents the equivalence class of the cyclic substring starting at i with length 2^k.
//   • Tips: Append a unique, smallest character (e.g., '$') to the string to handle suffixes as cyclic shifts.; Utilize counting sort for efficient sorting of characters and pairs of equivalence classes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the sentinel character can lead to incorrect suffix order or out-of-bounds access.; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices for cyclic shifts or substring lengths.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
