// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
// Output: true
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// 	-104 <= Node.val <= 104
// 	root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
// 	-105 <= k <= 105

// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to store ordered data in a hierarchical structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change while maintaining sorted order.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node has a key, and all keys in the left subtree are less than the node's key, while all keys in the right subtree are greater. Basic operations like search, insertion, and deletion typically have an average time complexity of O(log N) but can degrade to O(N) in the worst case.
//   • Invariants: For every node N, if L is in N's left subtree, then L.key < N.key.; For every node N, if R is in N's right subtree, then R.key > N.key.
//   • Tips: Understand the recursive definition for traversal and operations.; Handle edge cases like empty tree, single node, or leaf nodes carefully.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can lead to O(N) worst-case performance for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can lead to data loss or incorrect structure.
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to store ordered data that allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion while maintaining sorted order. It's suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(log N) average time and O(N) worst-case.
//   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than its key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than its key.
//   • Tips: Maintain the BST property: left child < parent < right child.; Recursion simplifies many operations like search, insert, and traversal.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade performance to O(N) for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can break BST properties or lead to data loss.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
