// Problem Description:
// Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.
//
// A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.
//
//
// 	For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
// Output: true
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100
// 	s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.

// - Substring Search (string, array, kmp, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern within a larger text, especially when the pattern might have repeating or overlapping prefixes.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that avoids re-scanning characters in the text by pre-processing the pattern to build a 'longest proper prefix suffix' (LPS) array. It achieves optimal O(N + M) time complexity, where N is the text length and M is the pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `j` pointer always indicates the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `text[0...i-1]`.; The `lps[j]` value stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...j-1]`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the LPS array (also known as failure function or border array) for the pattern.; The LPS array helps determine the next best match position after a mismatch, avoiding redundant comparisons.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the LPS array can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors when indexing the pattern or text are common.
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing)
//   • When to use: When comparing strings or substrings efficiently, especially for equality checks or finding duplicates, to reduce comparison time from O(m) to O(1) on average.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string into a numerical value (hash) using a polynomial rolling hash function, allowing for O(1) average-case comparison of strings or substrings. This technique typically involves modular arithmetic to keep hash values within a manageable range.
//   • Invariants: The hash of any prefix s[0...i] is correctly calculated based on the chosen base and modulus.; Precomputed powers of the base 'p' are available and correct for all required string lengths.
//   • Tips: Convert characters to integers starting from 1 (e.g., 'a' -> 1) to avoid zero hashes for strings like 'a', 'aa'.; Precompute powers of the base 'p' and their modular inverses for efficient rolling hash calculations.
//   • Pitfalls: Choosing 'a' -> 0 can lead to identical hashes for strings like 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', causing false positives.; Using a single hash function can lead to collisions, where different strings produce the same hash, requiring careful handling.
// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
