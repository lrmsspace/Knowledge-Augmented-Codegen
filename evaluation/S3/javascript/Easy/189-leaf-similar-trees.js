// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
//
//
//
// For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).
//
// Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.
//
// Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.
//
// Example:
// Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
// Output: true
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range [1, 200].
// 	Both of the given trees will have values in the range [0, 200].

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when counting labeled trees or converting between a labeled tree and a unique sequence representation for combinatorial analysis. It provides a bijection for problems involving N labeled nodes.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence of length N-2 that represents a labeled tree with N nodes. It is constructed by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor, and can be reconstructed back into the tree.
//   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always contains N-2 elements for a tree with N nodes.; At each step of encoding, the removed node is a leaf with the smallest label among all current leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for efficient updates.; Use a min-priority queue to quickly find the smallest-labeled leaf.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating node degrees after removal.; Off-by-one errors when dealing with 0-indexed vs. 1-indexed labels.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
