// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.
//
// If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.
//
// Assume a BST is defined as follows:
//
//
// 	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
// 	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
// 	Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
// Output: [2]
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// 	-105 <= Node.val <= 105
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (tree, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently find the MEX of a sequence after multiple point updates, where the sequence elements are non-negative integers.
//   • Idea: This approach uses a segment tree or similar data structure to maintain counts of elements, allowing efficient O(log N) updates and O(log N) queries for the minimal excluded number (MEX). The core idea is to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sequence.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree correctly stores the count of distinct numbers within its represented range.; The MEX query always explores the leftmost child first if its range is not 'full' (i.e., missing elements).
//   • Tips: Build the tree over the range of possible non-negative integer values, typically up to N or a maximum constraint.; Each tree node should store the count of distinct numbers present within its represented range.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle numbers larger than the maximum range covered by the segment tree.; Incorrectly updating counts for elements, leading to stale or erroneous MEX values.
// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to store ordered data in a hierarchical structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change while maintaining sorted order.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node has a key, and all keys in the left subtree are less than the node's key, while all keys in the right subtree are greater. Basic operations like search, insertion, and deletion typically have an average time complexity of O(log N) but can degrade to O(N) in the worst case.
//   • Invariants: For every node N, if L is in N's left subtree, then L.key < N.key.; For every node N, if R is in N's right subtree, then R.key > N.key.
//   • Tips: Understand the recursive definition for traversal and operations.; Handle edge cases like empty tree, single node, or leaf nodes carefully.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can lead to O(N) worst-case performance for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can lead to data loss or incorrect structure.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Farach-Colton and Bender Algorithm (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: When frequent LCA queries are needed on a static tree, and optimal query time is critical. It's suitable for scenarios requiring O(1) query time after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a tree by reducing the problem to Range Minimum Query (RMQ) on an Euler tour. It preprocesses the tree in O(N) time using DFS to build an array of nodes and their depths, then answers LCA queries in O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour array contains every edge traversed twice, and each node appears at least once.; The depth array stores the correct distance from the root for each node's occurrence in the Euler tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a DFS to construct the Euler tour and depth array.; Store both the node identifier and its depth during the Euler tour.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the start and end indices for the RMQ on the Euler tour.; Off-by-one errors when mapping Euler tour indices to original nodes or depths.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
