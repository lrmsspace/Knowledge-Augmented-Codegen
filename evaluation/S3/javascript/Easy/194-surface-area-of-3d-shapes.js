// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/surface-area-of-3d-shapes/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an n x n grid where you have placed some 1 x 1 x 1 cubes. Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of cell (i, j).
//
// After placing these cubes, you have decided to glue any directly adjacent cubes to each other, forming several irregular 3D shapes.
//
// Return the total surface area of the resulting shapes.
//
// Note: The bottom face of each shape counts toward its surface area.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
// Output: 34
//
// Constraints:
// n == grid.length == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= n <= 50
// 	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50
//

// - Finding the rank of a matrix (matrix, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix. It's also applicable for understanding the dimension of the vector space spanned by the matrix's rows or columns.
//   • Idea: Determines the rank of a matrix by transforming it into row echelon form using Gaussian elimination. The rank is the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form, with a time complexity of O(N^3).
//   • Invariants: The number of non-zero rows processed so far equals the current rank.; All elements below the pivot in the current column are zeroed out.
//   • Tips: Always choose the largest absolute value pivot for numerical stability.; Swap rows to bring a non-zero element to the pivot position.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect zero checks.; Forgetting to increment rank only when a valid pivot is found.
// - Calculating the determinant using Kraut method in O(N^3) (matrix, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this method to compute the determinant of a square matrix efficiently by decomposing it into lower and upper triangular matrices. It is suitable for problems requiring O(N^3) complexity for matrix operations.
//   • Idea: The Kraut method computes the determinant of a square matrix by first decomposing it into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U), such that A = LU. The determinant is then the product of the diagonal elements of L and U, achieving O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After processing column k, the first k columns of L and first k rows of U are correctly computed.; For any i <= k and j <= k, the partial sum for A[i][j] from L and U elements up to index min(i,j) is maintained.
//   • Tips: Ensure the input matrix is square for determinant calculation.; The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: Division by zero can occur if a pivot element is zero, requiring pivoting strategies.; Floating-point precision issues can accumulate, especially for large matrices.
// - Undirected Graphs (graph, matrix, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when modeling symmetric relationships between entities, analyzing graph properties like connectivity or degrees, or simulating processes on a network where connections are bidirectional.
//   • Idea: An undirected graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges, where each edge connects two vertices symmetrically. Basic operations often have a time complexity of O(V+E) or O(V^2) depending on representation.
//   • Invariants: For every edge (u, v) in the graph, the edge (v, u) also exists.; The sum of degrees of all vertices equals twice the number of edges.
//   • Tips: Choose adjacency list for sparse graphs, adjacency matrix for dense graphs.; Degrees of vertices are easily calculated from adjacency representations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to add both (u,v) and (v,u) when using an adjacency matrix or list.; Not handling disconnected components during full graph traversals.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
