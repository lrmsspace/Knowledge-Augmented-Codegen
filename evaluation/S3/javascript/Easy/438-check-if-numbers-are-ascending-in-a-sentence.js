//
// Problem Description:
// A sentence is a list of tokens separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Every token is either a positive number consisting of digits 0-9 with no leading zeros, or a word consisting of lowercase English letters.
//
//
// 	For example, "a puppy has 2 eyes 4 legs" is a sentence with seven tokens: "2" and "4" are numbers and the other tokens such as "puppy" are words.
//
//
// Given a string s representing a sentence, you need to check if all the numbers in s are strictly increasing from left to right (i.e., other than the last number, each number is strictly smaller than the number on its right in s).
//
// Return true if so, or false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "1 box has 3 blue 4 red 6 green and 12 yellow marbles"
// Output: true
// Explanation: The numbers in s are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 12.
// They are strictly increasing from left to right: 1 < 3 < 4 < 6 < 12.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= s.length <= 200
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters, spaces, and digits from 0 to 9, inclusive.
// 	The number of tokens in s is between 2 and 100, inclusive.
// 	The tokens in s are separated by a single space.
// 	There are at least two numbers in s.
// 	Each number in s is a positive number less than 100, with no leading zeros.
// 	s contains no leading or trailing spaces.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to evaluate expressions given in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation) to compute their final numerical value.
//   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an expression in Reverse Polish Notation by processing elements sequentially. Numbers are pushed onto a stack, and operators pop two operands, compute, and push the result.
//   • Invariants: The stack always contains only numbers (operands or intermediate results).; For a valid RPN expression, the stack will have at least two elements when an operator is processed.
//   • Tips: Process the RPN expression from left to right, token by token.; Push numerical operands directly onto the stack.
//   • Pitfalls: Attempting to pop from an empty stack when an operator is encountered, indicating an invalid RPN expression.; Incorrect order of operands for non-commutative operations like subtraction or division.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
//   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
//   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
