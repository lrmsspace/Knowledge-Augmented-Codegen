// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/mean-of-array-after-removing-some-elements/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array arr, return the mean of the remaining integers after removing the smallest 5% and the largest 5% of the elements.
//
// Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be considered accepted.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3]
// Output: 2.00000
// Explanation: After erasing the minimum and the maximum values of this array, all elements are equal to 2, so the mean is 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 20 <= arr.length <= 1000
// 	arr.length is a multiple of 20.
// 	0 <= arr[i] <= 105

// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use Merge Sort when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or linked lists where random access is costly.
//   • Idea: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: Each sub-array passed to merge is sorted.; The merge operation combines two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array.
//   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to maintain stability.; Consider iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: High space complexity due to auxiliary arrays.; Overhead of recursion can be significant for small inputs.
// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity sort is required, especially for large datasets or when external sorting is beneficial. It is also suitable for linked lists where random access is inefficient.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo...mid]` and the right subarray `a[mid+1...hi]` are sorted.; During the merge, `a[lo...k-1]` contains the `k-lo` smallest elements from `aux[lo...hi]` in sorted order.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for merging to maintain stability and simplify the merge logic.; Consider the bottom-up iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits and potentially improve cache performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Requires O(N) auxiliary space, which can be a significant concern for memory-constrained environments.; Recursive implementations can lead to stack overflow errors for extremely large input arrays.
// - bucket-sort (array, bucket-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting elements with a known, uniform distribution over a specific range. It is efficient for numbers that are uniformly distributed across a range, often achieving linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates them. It can achieve O(N+K) average time complexity for uniformly distributed data.
//   • Invariants: After distributing elements, each element `x` is in bucket `floor(N * x)`.; After sorting buckets, every bucket `buckets[i]` contains its elements in sorted order.
//   • Tips: Choose the number of buckets appropriately based on data distribution and range.; Normalize input data to a [0, 1) range for simpler bucket indexing.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor performance with non-uniform data distribution, potentially degrading to O(N^2).; Requires extra space for the buckets, proportional to N+K.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
