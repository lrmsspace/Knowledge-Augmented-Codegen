// Problem Description:
// Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, return the minimum integer common to both arrays. If there is no common integer amongst nums1 and nums2, return -1.
//
// Note that an integer is said to be common to nums1 and nums2 if both arrays have at least one occurrence of that integer.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109
// 	Both nums1 and nums2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
//

// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Minkowski sum of convex polygons (geometry, array, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to compute the sum of two convex polygons, or efficiently determine the minimum distance or intersection between them.
//   • Idea: The Minkowski sum of two convex polygons P and Q is a new convex polygon formed by vector addition of all points from P and Q. It can be computed in O(|P| + |Q|) time by merging their edge vectors.
//   • Invariants: The current edge added to the Minkowski sum is the one with the smallest angle among the remaining edges from both polygons.; The sequence of edges in the Minkowski sum maintains convexity.
//   • Tips: The vertices of P+Q are sums of vertices of P and Q.; The edges of P+Q are the edges of P and Q, sorted by angle.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like collinear edges or degenerate polygons.; Floating point precision issues in geometric calculations.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
