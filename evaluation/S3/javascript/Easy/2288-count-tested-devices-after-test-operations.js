//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array batteryPercentages having length n, denoting the battery percentages of n 0-indexed devices.
//
// Your task is to test each device i in order from 0 to n - 1, by performing the following test operations:
//
//
// 	If batteryPercentages[i] is greater than 0:
//
// 	
// 		Increment the count of tested devices.
// 		Decrease the battery percentage of all devices with indices j in the range [i + 1, n - 1] by 1, ensuring their battery percentage never goes below 0, i.e, batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1).
// 		Move to the next device.
// 	
// 	
// 	Otherwise, move to the next device without performing any test.
//
//
// Return an integer denoting the number of devices that will be tested after performing the test operations in order.
//
// Example:
// Input: batteryPercentages = [1,1,2,1,3]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:
// At device 0, batteryPercentages[0] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,2].
// At device 1, batteryPercentages[1] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
// At device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,1].
// At device 3, batteryPercentages[3] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
// At device 4, batteryPercentages[4] > 0, so there are now 3 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.
// So, the answer is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == batteryPercentages.length <= 100 
// 	0 <= batteryPercentages[i] <= 100

// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to uniquely encode or decode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers, or to count the number of spanning trees for a complete graph. It's also useful for problems involving tree properties like degree sequences.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence representing a labeled tree, allowing conversion between a tree and a sequence of numbers. Its generation and decoding typically involve an iterative process of finding and removing leaves, achieving O(N log N) or O(N) complexity with optimized leaf finding.
//   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always has N-2 elements for an N-vertex tree.; Each vertex's degree is correctly maintained throughout the process.
//   • Tips: Maintain a degree array to efficiently find leaves.; Use a min-priority queue or a two-pointer approach for finding the smallest leaf.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in sequence length or vertex indexing.; Incorrectly handling the last two vertices during decoding.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Do not add custom input parsing or console I/O unless the template explicitly requires it; rely on parameters/return value only.
// - Use standard ECMAScript features supported by LeetCode (Node.js runtime); no external packages.
// - Be careful with number precision: JavaScript Number is double; use BigInt only when necessary and keep return type consistent with the problem requirements.
// - If you introduce helper functions, define them in the same file and avoid relying on global mutable state across test cases.
