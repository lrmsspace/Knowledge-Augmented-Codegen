#
# Problem Description:
# There are n 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.
#
# You are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (directions[i] is either 'L' for left or 'R' for right). All integers in positions are unique.
#
# All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.
#
# If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.
#
# Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final health of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.
#
# Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.
#
# Note: The positions may be unsorted.
#
# Example:
# Input: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = "RRRRR"
# Output: [2,17,9,15,10]
# Explanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 105
# 	1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 109
# 	directions[i] == 'L' or directions[i] == 'R'
# 	All values in positions are distinct

# - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, stack, simulation, monotonic-stack)
#   • When to use: This technique is used to answer Range Minimum Queries efficiently on a static array by transforming them into Lowest Common Ancestor queries on a Cartesian Tree.
#   • Idea: This approach solves Range Minimum Query problems by constructing a Cartesian Tree from the input array, where the root of any subtree is its minimum element. RMQ for a given range then reduces to finding the Lowest Common Ancestor of the range's endpoints in this tree, allowing O(N) construction and O(1) query time after O(N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian Tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the subtree rooted at `u`.; For any node `u`, all nodes in its left subtree have indices smaller than `index(u)`, and all nodes in its right subtree have indices larger than `index(u)`.
#   • Tips: A Cartesian Tree is a binary tree where each node's value is less than its children's values, and an in-order traversal yields the original array.; Utilize a monotonic stack to construct the Cartesian Tree in linear O(N) time.
#   • Pitfalls: Correctly implementing the monotonic stack for Cartesian Tree construction can be challenging.; Edge cases, such as an empty stack or handling the last elements during tree building, must be managed carefully.
# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
#   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
#   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
#   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to uniquely encode or decode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers, or to count the number of spanning trees for a complete graph. It's also useful for problems involving tree properties like degree sequences.
#   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence representing a labeled tree, allowing conversion between a tree and a sequence of numbers. Its generation and decoding typically involve an iterative process of finding and removing leaves, achieving O(N log N) or O(N) complexity with optimized leaf finding.
#   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always has N-2 elements for an N-vertex tree.; Each vertex's degree is correctly maintained throughout the process.
#   • Tips: Maintain a degree array to efficiently find leaves.; Use a min-priority queue or a two-pointer approach for finding the smallest leaf.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in sequence length or vertex indexing.; Incorrectly handling the last two vertices during decoding.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
