# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-jump/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array arr. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.
#
# You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:
#
#
# 	During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
# 	During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
# 	It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.
#
#
# A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).
#
# Return the number of good starting indices.
#
# Example:
# Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.
# From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.
# From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
# From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
# In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
# jumps.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104
# 	0 <= arr[i] < 105

# - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when performing many range queries on a static array where the query operation is idempotent (e.g., min, max, GCD) to achieve O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
#   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths, allowing O(1) query time for idempotent operations like range minimum/maximum queries. Precomputation takes O(N log N) time and space.
#   • Invariants: The `st[k][i]` entry stores the result of the operation for the range `[i, i + 2^k - 1]`.; All ranges of length `2^k` starting at `i` are correctly computed in `st[k][i]` during precomputation.
#   • Tips: Precompute logarithms for O(1) lookup of `floor(log2(length))` during queries.; Sparse tables are most efficient for idempotent operations (min, max, GCD, OR, AND) due to overlapping segments.
#   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for dynamic arrays or scenarios requiring updates, as modifications invalidate the precomputed table.; High memory usage: requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.
# - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to perform many range queries on a static array, especially when the query operation is associative and idempotent, allowing for O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
#   • Idea: A Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths. It allows O(1) query time for idempotent operations like min/max/gcd and O(log N) for non-idempotent associative operations, after an O(N log N) build time.
#   • Invariants: After precomputation, dp[k][i] stores the result for the range [i, i + 2^k - 1].; For any k > 0, dp[k][i] is the result of combining dp[k-1][i] and dp[k-1][i + 2^(k-1)].
#   • Tips: Precompute log2 values for faster range length calculations.; Store dp[k][i] as the result for range [i, i + 2^k - 1].
#   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to array elements efficiently.; Requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.
# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
#   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
#   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
#   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
