#
# Problem Description:
# Let's say a positive integer is a super-palindrome if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.
#
# Given two positive integers left and right represented as strings, return the number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
#
# Example:
# Input: left = "4", right = "1000"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
# Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= left.length, right.length <= 18
# 	left and right consist of only digits.
# 	left and right cannot have leading zeros.
# 	left and right represent integers in the range [1, 1018 - 1].
# 	left is less than or equal to right.

# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
#   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
#   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
#   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
#   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
#   • When to use: When counting numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based properties, or calculating a sum of such properties.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique used to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers within a given range, based on their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, processing digits from most significant to least significant, achieving a time complexity of O(log(N) * S * T) where S is sum/state range and T is tight constraint.
#   • Invariants: The `idx` parameter always represents the current digit position being processed, from most significant to least significant.; The `tight` boolean parameter accurately indicates if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's corresponding digit.
#   • Tips: Handle leading zeros carefully, often with a dedicated boolean state in the DP function.; Use a 'tight' or 'limit' boolean parameter to manage the upper bound constraint imposed by the original number.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint can lead to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to reset the memoization table for each new query or test case, especially in competitive programming.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
