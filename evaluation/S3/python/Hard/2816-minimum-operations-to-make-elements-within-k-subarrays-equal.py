# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-elements-within-k-subarrays-equal/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array nums and two integers, x and k. You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):
#
#
# 	Increase or decrease any element of nums by 1.
#
#
# Return the minimum number of operations needed to have at least k non-overlapping subarrays of size exactly x in nums, where all elements within each subarray are equal.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [5,-2,1,3,7,3,6,4,-1], x = 3, k = 2
#
# Output: 8
#
# Explanation:
#
#
# 	Use 3 operations to add 3 to nums[1] and use 2 operations to subtract 2 from nums[3]. The resulting array is [5, 1, 1, 1, 7, 3, 6, 4, -1].
# 	Use 1 operation to add 1 to nums[5] and use 2 operations to subtract 2 from nums[6]. The resulting array is [5, 1, 1, 1, 7, 4, 4, 4, -1].
# 	Now, all elements within each subarray [1, 1, 1] (from indices 1 to 3) and [4, 4, 4] (from indices 5 to 7) are equal. Since 8 total operations were used, 8 is the output.
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	-106 <= nums[i] <= 106
# 	2 <= x <= nums.length
# 	1 <= k <= 15
# 	2 <= k * x <= nums.length

# - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
#   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
#   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, ds, sliding-window, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when performing frequent range queries and point updates on an array, especially when a segment tree is too complex or memory-intensive, or when query types are diverse. It offers a balanced time complexity for both operations.
#   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and point updates. It achieves O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations.
#   • Invariants: Each element `arr[i]` belongs to exactly one block `block[i / block_size]`.; The summary for each block `block_summary[j]` accurately reflects the state of elements within block `j`.
#   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for balanced performance.; Precompute block summaries (e.g., sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or boundaries.; Forgetting to update the block's summary after a point update.
# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
#   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
#   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
#   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
