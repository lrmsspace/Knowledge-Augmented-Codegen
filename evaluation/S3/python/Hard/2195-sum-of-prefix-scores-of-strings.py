# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-prefix-scores-of-strings/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an array words of size n consisting of non-empty strings.
#
# We define the score of a string term as the number of strings words[i] such that term is a prefix of words[i].
#
#
# 	For example, if words = ["a", "ab", "abc", "cab"], then the score of "ab" is 2, since "ab" is a prefix of both "ab" and "abc".
#
#
# Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the sum of scores of every non-empty prefix of words[i].
#
# Note that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.
#
# Example:
# Input: words = ["abc","ab","bc","b"]
# Output: [5,4,3,2]
# Explanation: The answer for each string is the following:
# - "abc" has 3 prefixes: "a", "ab", and "abc".
# - There are 2 strings with the prefix "a", 2 strings with the prefix "ab", and 1 string with the prefix "abc".
# The total is answer[0] = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.
# - "ab" has 2 prefixes: "a" and "ab".
# - There are 2 strings with the prefix "a", and 2 strings with the prefix "ab".
# The total is answer[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.
# - "bc" has 2 prefixes: "b" and "bc".
# - There are 2 strings with the prefix "b", and 1 string with the prefix "bc".
# The total is answer[2] = 2 + 1 = 3.
# - "b" has 1 prefix: "b".
# - There are 2 strings with the prefix "b".
# The total is answer[3] = 2.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= words.length <= 1000
# 	1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
# 	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

# - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
#   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
#   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
#   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.
# - Tries (trie, array, trie-match)
#   • When to use: Use when managing string keys in a symbol table and needing efficient prefix, wildcard, or longest prefix matching operations, offering flexibility beyond binary search trees and speed comparable to hashing.
#   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where keys are typically strings. It allows for efficient retrieval of keys based on their prefixes, achieving O(L) time complexity for operations, where L is the key length.
#   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node exists only if it is part of at least one stored key.
#   • Tips: Choose an appropriate branching factor (R) based on the alphabet size.; Represent children using arrays for fixed alphabets or hash maps for sparse ones.
#   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or sparse data.; Deletion of keys can be complex, requiring careful handling of empty branches.
# - Tries (trie, tree, trie-match)
#   • When to use: Use when managing a collection of strings and requiring efficient prefix-based operations like search, insertion, deletion, or finding the longest common prefix.
#   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where nodes represent characters and paths from the root represent strings. Operations like insertion, search, and deletion typically take O(L) time, where L is the length of the key.
#   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node's children pointers correspond to the next character in a string.
#   • Tips: Mark nodes as 'end of word' to distinguish prefixes from complete words.; Use an array for children pointers if the alphabet size is small and fixed (e.g., ASCII).
#   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or very deep tries due to many empty child pointers.; Deletion can be complex, requiring careful handling of nodes that are part of other words.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
