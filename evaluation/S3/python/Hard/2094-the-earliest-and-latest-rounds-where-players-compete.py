# Problem Description:
# There is a tournament where n players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.).
#
# The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.
#
#
# 	For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
#
# 	
# 		Player 1 competes against player 7.
# 		Player 2 competes against player 6.
# 		Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.
# 	
# 	
#
#
# After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).
#
# The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.
#
# Given the integers n, firstPlayer, and secondPlayer, return an integer array containing two values, the earliest possible round number and the latest possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4
# Output: [3,4]
# Explanation:
# One possible scenario which leads to the earliest round number:
# First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Second round: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11
# Third round: 2, 3, 4
# One possible scenario which leads to the latest round number:
# First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Second round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Third round: 1, 2, 4
# Fourth round: 2, 4
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= n <= 28
# 	1 <= firstPlayer < secondPlayer <= n

# - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
#   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
#   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
#   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
#   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
#   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to uniquely encode or decode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers, or to count the number of spanning trees for a complete graph. It's also useful for problems involving tree properties like degree sequences.
#   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence representing a labeled tree, allowing conversion between a tree and a sequence of numbers. Its generation and decoding typically involve an iterative process of finding and removing leaves, achieving O(N log N) or O(N) complexity with optimized leaf finding.
#   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always has N-2 elements for an N-vertex tree.; Each vertex's degree is correctly maintained throughout the process.
#   • Tips: Maintain a degree array to efficiently find leaves.; Use a min-priority queue or a two-pointer approach for finding the smallest leaf.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in sequence length or vertex indexing.; Incorrectly handling the last two vertices during decoding.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
