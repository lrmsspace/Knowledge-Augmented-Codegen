# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-subarray-gcd-score/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k.
#
# You may perform at most k operations. In each operation, you can choose one element in the array and double its value. Each element can be doubled at most once.
#
# The score of a contiguous subarray is defined as the product of its length and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all its elements.
#
# Your task is to return the maximum score that can be achieved by selecting a contiguous subarray from the modified array.
#
# Note:
#
#
#  The greatest common divisor (GCD) of an array is the largest integer that evenly divides all the array elements.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,4], k = 1
#
# Output: 8
#
# Explanation:
#
#
#  Double nums[0] to 4 using one operation. The modified array becomes [4, 4].
#  The GCD of the subarray [4, 4] is 4, and the length is 2.
#  Thus, the maximum possible score is 2 × 4 = 8.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n == nums.length <= 1500
#  1 <= nums[i] <= 109
#  1 <= k <= n

#   • When to use: When a problem involves finding an optimal value for a contiguous range of elements, and solutions for larger ranges can be derived by merging optimal solutions of smaller sub-ranges.
#   • Idea: An extension of dynamic programming where subproblems are defined over contiguous intervals, solving for dp[i][j] by iterating through all possible split points k within [i, j]. This often results in O(N^3) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: dp[i][j] represents the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; When computing dp[i][j], all subproblems dp[x][y] where y - x + 1 < j - i + 1 are already solved.
#   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length, then by start index.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.; Incorrect iteration order, leading to uncomputed subproblems.
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
#   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
#   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
# - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
#   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
#   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
