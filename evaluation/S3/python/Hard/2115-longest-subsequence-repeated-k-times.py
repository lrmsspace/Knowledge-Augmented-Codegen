# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-repeated-k-times/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a string s of length n, and an integer k. You are tasked to find the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s.
#
# A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
#
# A subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s, where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times.
#
#
# 	For example, "bba" is repeated 2 times in the string "bababcba", because the string "bbabba", constructed by concatenating "bba" 2 times, is a subsequence of the string "bababcba".
#
#
# Return the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the lexicographically largest one. If there is no such subsequence, return an empty string.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "letsleetcode", k = 2
# Output: "let"
# Explanation: There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times: "let" and "ete".
# "let" is the lexicographically largest one.
#
# Constraints:
# n == s.length
# 	2 <= k <= 2000
# 	2 <= n < min(2001, k * 8)
# 	s consists of lowercase English letters.

# - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
#   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
#   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
#   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
# - Substring Search (string, array, kmp, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern within a larger text, especially when the pattern might have repeating or overlapping prefixes.
#   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that avoids re-scanning characters in the text by pre-processing the pattern to build a 'longest proper prefix suffix' (LPS) array. It achieves optimal O(N + M) time complexity, where N is the text length and M is the pattern length.
#   • Invariants: The `j` pointer always indicates the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `text[0...i-1]`.; The `lps[j]` value stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...j-1]`.
#   • Tips: Pre-compute the LPS array (also known as failure function or border array) for the pattern.; The LPS array helps determine the next best match position after a mismatch, avoiding redundant comparisons.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the LPS array can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors when indexing the pattern or text are common.
# - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
#   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
#   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
#   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.

# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
