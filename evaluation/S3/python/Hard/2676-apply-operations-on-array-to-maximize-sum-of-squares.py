# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-on-array-to-maximize-sum-of-squares/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a positive integer k.
#
# You can do the following operation on the array any number of times:
#
#
# 	Choose any two distinct indices i and j and simultaneously update the values of nums[i] to (nums[i] AND nums[j]) and nums[j] to (nums[i] OR nums[j]). Here, OR denotes the bitwise OR operation, and AND denotes the bitwise AND operation.
#
#
# You have to choose k elements from the final array and calculate the sum of their squares.
#
# Return the maximum sum of squares you can achieve.
#
# Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,6,5,8], k = 2
# Output: 261
# Explanation: We can do the following operations on the array:
# - Choose i = 0 and j = 3, then change nums[0] to (2 AND 8) = 0 and nums[3] to (2 OR 8) = 10. The resulting array is nums = [0,6,5,10].
# - Choose i = 2 and j = 3, then change nums[2] to (5 AND 10) = 0 and nums[3] to (5 OR 10) = 15. The resulting array is nums = [0,6,0,15].
# We can choose the elements 15 and 6 from the final array. The sum of squares is 152 + 62 = 261.
# It can be shown that this is the maximum value we can get.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
# 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109

# - Bit manipulation (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: When problems involve manipulating individual bits of numbers, representing sets as bitmasks, or optimizing operations on powers of two. It is also useful for certain combinatorics and dynamic programming problems.
#   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators. This technique is often used to optimize computations, manage boolean flags efficiently, or represent subsets, typically achieving O(1) complexity for fixed-size integers.
#   • Invariants: Each bit in the mask accurately reflects the inclusion or exclusion status of its corresponding element.; Bitwise operations maintain the integrity of unaffected bits.
#   • Tips: Use (1 << k) to create a mask with the k-th bit set.; n & (n-1) clears the least significant set bit.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrect operator precedence can lead to subtle bugs.; Mixing signed and unsigned integers in bitwise operations can yield unexpected results.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
# - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, difference-array)
#   • When to use: Use when an array requires frequent point updates and efficient retrieval of prefix sums or range sums. It offers logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
#   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that efficiently supports point updates and prefix sum queries on an array in O(log N) time.
#   • Invariants: Each `bit[i]` stores the sum of a contiguous range of elements from the original array.; The range length represented by `bit[i]` is determined by `i & -i` (the least significant bit).
#   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for simpler bitwise operations (`i & -i`).; Initialize with an existing array in O(N) time using a linear construction method.
#   • Pitfalls: Directly finding range minimum/maximum is not efficient or generally supported.; Operations must be associative and preferably invertible for general range queries.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
