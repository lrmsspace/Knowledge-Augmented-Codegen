# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-a-tree-from-preorder-traversal/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# We run a preorder depth-first search (DFS) on the root of a binary tree.
#
# At each node in this traversal, we output D dashes (where D is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  If the depth of a node is D, the depth of its immediate child is D + 1.  The depth of the root node is 0.
#
# If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.
#
# Given the output traversal of this traversal, recover the tree and return its root.
#
# Example:
# Input: traversal = "1-2--3--4-5--6--7"
# Output: [1,2,5,3,4,6,7]
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the original tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# 	1 <= Node.val <= 109

# - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: This algorithm is used to evaluate expressions given in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation) to compute their final numerical value.
#   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an expression in Reverse Polish Notation by processing elements sequentially. Numbers are pushed onto a stack, and operators pop two operands, compute, and push the result.
#   • Invariants: The stack always contains only numbers (operands or intermediate results).; For a valid RPN expression, the stack will have at least two elements when an operator is processed.
#   • Tips: Process the RPN expression from left to right, token by token.; Push numerical operands directly onto the stack.
#   • Pitfalls: Attempting to pop from an empty stack when an operator is encountered, indicating an invalid RPN expression.; Incorrect order of operands for non-commutative operations like subtraction or division.
# - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
#   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
#   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to uniquely encode or decode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers, or to count the number of spanning trees for a complete graph. It's also useful for problems involving tree properties like degree sequences.
#   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence representing a labeled tree, allowing conversion between a tree and a sequence of numbers. Its generation and decoding typically involve an iterative process of finding and removing leaves, achieving O(N log N) or O(N) complexity with optimized leaf finding.
#   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always has N-2 elements for an N-vertex tree.; Each vertex's degree is correctly maintained throughout the process.
#   • Tips: Maintain a degree array to efficiently find leaves.; Use a min-priority queue or a two-pointer approach for finding the smallest leaf.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in sequence length or vertex indexing.; Incorrectly handling the last two vertices during decoding.

# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
