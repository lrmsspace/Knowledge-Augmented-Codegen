# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-edges-to-make-degrees-of-all-nodes-even/   |   Difficulty: Hard
#
# Problem Description:
# There is an undirected graph consisting of n nodes numbered from 1 to n. You are given the integer n and a 2D array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi. The graph can be disconnected.
#
# You can add at most two additional edges (possibly none) to this graph so that there are no repeated edges and no self-loops.
#
# Return true if it is possible to make the degree of each node in the graph even, otherwise return false.
#
# The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,2],[1,4],[2,5]]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The above diagram shows a valid way of adding an edge.
# Every node in the resulting graph is connected to an even number of edges.
#
# Constraints:
# 3 <= n <= 105
# 	2 <= edges.length <= 105
# 	edges[i].length == 2
# 	1 <= ai, bi <= n
# 	ai != bi
# 	There are no repeated edges.

# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to uniquely encode or decode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers, or to count the number of spanning trees for a complete graph. It's also useful for problems involving tree properties like degree sequences.
#   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence representing a labeled tree, allowing conversion between a tree and a sequence of numbers. Its generation and decoding typically involve an iterative process of finding and removing leaves, achieving O(N log N) or O(N) complexity with optimized leaf finding.
#   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always has N-2 elements for an N-vertex tree.; Each vertex's degree is correctly maintained throughout the process.
#   • Tips: Maintain a degree array to efficiently find leaves.; Use a min-priority queue or a two-pointer approach for finding the smallest leaf.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in sequence length or vertex indexing.; Incorrectly handling the last two vertices during decoding.
# - Finding the Eulerian path in O(M) (graph, enumeration, bfs)
#   • When to use: Use when the problem requires visiting every edge in a graph exactly once, either starting and ending at the same vertex (cycle) or at two different vertices (path).
#   • Idea: An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. An Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian path that starts and ends on the same vertex.
#   • Invariants: Every edge in the graph is considered exactly once for inclusion in the path.; The current path segment always forms a valid trail in the graph.
#   • Tips: Check vertex degrees to determine path/cycle existence before attempting to find it.; For an Eulerian path, start traversal from one of the two odd-degree vertices.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling multi-edges or self-loops can lead to errors in degree calculation or traversal.; Failing to check graph connectivity can result in incomplete paths or infinite loops.
# - Finding Bridges Online (graph, ds, union-find, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when edges are added one by one to an initially empty graph and you need to efficiently track the number of bridges or 2-edge-connected components after each addition.
#   • Idea: This algorithm dynamically maintains the number of bridges in an undirected graph as edges are added incrementally. It leverages a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to achieve an amortized time complexity of O((N+M) log N).
#   • Invariants: Each DSU set represents a 2-edge-connected component or a collection of such components connected by bridges.; The total count of bridges accurately reflects edges whose removal increases connected components.
#   • Tips: Understand the properties of 2-edge-connected components and how they relate to bridges.; Carefully manage DSU operations, including path compression and union by rank/size, for optimal performance.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating the bridge count after an edge addition, especially when cycles are formed.; Inefficient DSU operations leading to a higher than expected time complexity.

# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
