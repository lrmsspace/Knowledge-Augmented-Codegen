#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
# Output: true
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
#
#
#  
# Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

# - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
#   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
#   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
#   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
#   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Binary Search Trees
#  (tree, recursion)
#   • When to use: When you need to store ordered data that allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion while maintaining sorted order. It's suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change.
#   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(log N) average time and O(N) worst-case.
#   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than its key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than its key.
#   • Tips: Maintain the BST property: left child < parent < right child.; Recursion simplifies many operations like search, insert, and traversal.
#   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade performance to O(N) for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can break BST properties or lead to data loss.
# - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
#   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
#   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
