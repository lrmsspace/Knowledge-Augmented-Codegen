# Problem Description:
# Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.
#
# Example:
# Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
# Output: true
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
# 	0 <= Node.val <= 9
#
#
#  
# Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

# - Floyd's Linked List Cycle Finding Algorithm (linked-list, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently detect if a linked list contains a cycle and, optionally, find the entry point of that cycle, using only constant extra space.
#   • Idea: This algorithm uses two pointers, one moving faster than the other, to detect if a cycle exists in a linked list. If a cycle is found, it can then determine the cycle's starting node in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
#   • Invariants: The slow and fast pointers are always valid nodes or null.; In the detection phase, the fast pointer always covers twice the distance of the slow pointer.
#   • Tips: Initialize both slow and fast pointers at the head of the list.; Move the slow pointer by one step and the fast pointer by two steps in each iteration.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check for null on 'fast' and 'fast.next' before dereferencing them.; Incorrectly assuming the list is non-empty or has at least two nodes.
# - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, queue, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when frequent insertions or deletions at the beginning or end of a collection are required, or when the collection size is highly dynamic and unpredictable.
#   • Idea: Linked lists implement dynamic collections like queues and stacks by chaining nodes, each holding an item and a reference to the next node. Operations like adding or removing elements at the ends typically achieve O(1) time complexity, while random access is O(N).
#   • Invariants: The `first` pointer always references the head node, or is null if the list is empty.; The `last` pointer always references the tail node, or is null if the list is empty.
#   • Tips: Maintain separate `first` and `last` pointers for O(1) enqueue/dequeue operations.; Keep a `size` counter to provide O(1) size retrieval.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update `first` or `last` pointers correctly can lead to broken lists or memory leaks.; Null pointer exceptions are common when traversing or modifying an empty or partially traversed list.
# - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure is required, and dynamic size with efficient O(1) push and pop operations is crucial, especially without a fixed capacity.
#   • Idea: This describes implementing a stack using a singly linked list, where elements are added and removed from the head of the list. Both push and pop operations achieve O(1) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The 'first' pointer always points to the top element of the stack, or is null if the stack is empty.; Each node's 'next' pointer correctly links to the subsequent element in the stack, maintaining the LIFO order.
#   • Tips: Maintain a 'first' pointer to the head of the linked list, representing the stack's top.; Push operation involves creating a new node, linking it to the current 'first', then updating 'first'.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case for pop, leading to `NoSuchElementException`.; Incorrectly updating the 'first' pointer during push or pop, which can break the list structure.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
