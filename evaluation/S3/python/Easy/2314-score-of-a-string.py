# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-a-string/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.
#
# Return the score of s.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "hello"
#
# Output: 13
#
# Explanation:
#
# The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'h' = 104, 'e' = 101, 'l' = 108, 'o' = 111. So, the score of s would be |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= s.length <= 100
# 	s consists only of lowercase English letters.

# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
#   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
#   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
# - Integration by Simpson's formula (number, interval, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when approximating definite integrals of functions that are sufficiently smooth over a given interval. It is effective for achieving good accuracy with a moderate number of subintervals.
#   • Idea: Simpson's formula approximates a definite integral by dividing the integration interval into an even number of subintervals and approximating the function over each pair of subintervals with a parabola. This method offers a higher order of accuracy compared to simpler rules, typically achieving O(N^4) accuracy for N subintervals.
#   • Invariants: The sum accumulates weighted function values for all processed subintervals.; The subinterval width 'h' remains constant across the entire integration range.
#   • Tips: Ensure the total number of subintervals (2n) is always even for the composite rule.; The weights for function evaluations follow a specific 1-4-2-4-...-2-4-1 pattern.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the weighting coefficients, especially at the boundaries or interior points.; Using an odd number of subintervals, which invalidates the parabolic approximation for the composite rule.
# - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
#   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
#   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
