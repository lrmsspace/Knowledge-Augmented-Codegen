# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-good-pairs-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given 2 integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of lengths n and m respectively. You are also given a positive integer k.
#
# A pair (i, j) is called good if nums1[i] is divisible by nums2[j] * k (0 <= i <= n - 1, 0 <= j <= m - 1).
#
# Return the total number of good pairs.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums1 = [1,3,4], nums2 = [1,3,4], k = 1
#
# Output: 5
#
# Explanation:
# The 5 good pairs are (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), and (2, 2).
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n, m <= 50
# 	1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 50
# 	1 <= k <= 50

# - Binomial Coefficients (array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: When you need to calculate the number of ways to choose k items from n distinct items, often under modular constraints.
#   • Idea: Binomial coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n distinct items. They can be computed using Pascal's identity or factorials, with complexity varying based on the method and modulo requirements.
#   • Invariants: For Pascal's triangle, dp[i][j] stores C(i, j).; For factorial method, fact[i] stores i! % M.
#   • Tips: Use Pascal's triangle for small n and k values.; Precompute factorials and inverse factorials for larger n modulo a prime.
#   • Pitfalls: Overflow with large factorials if not using modular arithmetic.; Division by zero when computing inverse modulo if modulus is not prime.
# - Lattice points inside non-lattice polygon (number, recursion, counting, gcd)
#   • When to use: Use when counting pairs or elements satisfying divisibility or GCD conditions. Also applicable for summing functions over pairs using number theory properties.
#   • Idea: This approach leverages number theoretic properties like GCD, LCM, and prime factorization to efficiently count elements or pairs satisfying specific criteria. It often involves iterating through divisors or multiples, achieving complexities like O(N log N) or O(sqrt N) per query.
#   • Invariants: All numbers processed so far have their relevant number-theoretic properties (e.g., prime factors, divisors) correctly determined.; The current count or sum accurately reflects all valid combinations found up to the current iteration.
#   • Tips: Precompute primes or divisors using a sieve for efficiency.; Utilize properties of GCD and LCM, such as gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b.
#   • Pitfalls: Overcounting or undercounting when using inclusion-exclusion.; Integer overflow with large products or sums.
# - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
#   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
#   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
