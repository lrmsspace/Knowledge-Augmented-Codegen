# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-the-temperature/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a non-negative floating point number rounded to two decimal places celsius, that denotes the temperature in Celsius.
#
# You should convert Celsius into Kelvin and Fahrenheit and return it as an array ans = [kelvin, fahrenheit].
#
# Return the array ans. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
#
# Note that:
#
#
# 	Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15
# 	Fahrenheit = Celsius * 1.80 + 32.00
#
# Example:
# Input: celsius = 36.50
# Output: [309.65000,97.70000]
# Explanation: Temperature at 36.50 Celsius converted in Kelvin is 309.65 and converted in Fahrenheit is 97.70.
#
# Constraints:
# 0 <= celsius <= 1000

# - Simulated Annealing (array, number, randomized, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when seeking a near-optimal solution for complex optimization problems with many local optima, especially when exact solutions are computationally infeasible or too slow.
#   • Idea: Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic metaheuristic for global optimization, inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It explores the search space by accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases over time, aiming to escape local optima.
#   • Invariants: The `s_best` state always represents the lowest energy found across all iterations so far.; The temperature `T` is always non-negative and decreases monotonically with each iteration.
#   • Tips: Start with a sufficiently high initial temperature to allow broad exploration.; Choose a slow cooling schedule (decay rate) for better solution quality, at the cost of longer runtime.
#   • Pitfalls: Getting stuck in local minima if the cooling schedule is too fast.; Excessive runtime if the cooling schedule is too slow or initial temperature is too high.
# - Integration by Simpson's formula (number, interval, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when approximating definite integrals of functions that are sufficiently smooth over a given interval. It is effective for achieving good accuracy with a moderate number of subintervals.
#   • Idea: Simpson's formula approximates a definite integral by dividing the integration interval into an even number of subintervals and approximating the function over each pair of subintervals with a parabola. This method offers a higher order of accuracy compared to simpler rules, typically achieving O(N^4) accuracy for N subintervals.
#   • Invariants: The sum accumulates weighted function values for all processed subintervals.; The subinterval width 'h' remains constant across the entire integration range.
#   • Tips: Ensure the total number of subintervals (2n) is always even for the composite rule.; The weights for function evaluations follow a specific 1-4-2-4-...-2-4-1 pattern.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the weighting coefficients, especially at the boundaries or interior points.; Using an odd number of subintervals, which invalidates the parabolic approximation for the composite rule.
# - Gray code (number, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
#   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
#   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
#   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
