# Problem Description:
# Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, and the integer d, return the distance value between the two arrays.
#
# The distance value is defined as the number of elements arr1[i] such that there is not any element arr2[j] where |arr1[i]-arr2[j]| <= d.
#
# Example:
# Input: arr1 = [4,5,8], arr2 = [10,9,1,8], d = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# For arr1[0]=4 we have: 
# |4-10|=6 > d=2 
# |4-9|=5 > d=2 
# |4-1|=3 > d=2 
# |4-8|=4 > d=2 
# For arr1[1]=5 we have: 
# |5-10|=5 > d=2 
# |5-9|=4 > d=2 
# |5-1|=4 > d=2 
# |5-8|=3 > d=2
# For arr1[2]=8 we have:
# |8-10|=2 <= d=2
# |8-9|=1 <= d=2
# |8-1|=7 > d=2
# |8-8|=0 <= d=2
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 500
# 	-1000 <= arr1[i], arr2[j] <= 1000
# 	0 <= d <= 100

# - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
#   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
#   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
#   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
#   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
#   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
#   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
# - Burnside's lemma / Pólya enumeration theorem (array, number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting the number of distinct configurations or arrangements of objects under a set of symmetry operations, where configurations are considered identical if one can be transformed into another by a group action.
#   • Idea: Burnside's Lemma and Pólya Enumeration Theorem are combinatorial tools used to count the number of distinct objects under a group of symmetries. Both typically involve iterating through group elements and analyzing permutation cycle structures, often resulting in polynomial time complexity depending on group size and element analysis.
#   • Invariants: The set of group elements considered remains consistent throughout the summation.; Each group element's cycle decomposition is correctly identified.
#   • Tips: Identify the group of symmetry operations acting on the objects.; For each group element, determine its permutation cycle structure.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the full set of distinct group operations.; Errors in determining the cycle structure of permutations.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
