#
# Problem Description:
# A string s is nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that s contains, it appears both in uppercase and lowercase. For example, "abABB" is nice because 'A' and 'a' appear, and 'B' and 'b' appear. However, "abA" is not because 'b' appears, but 'B' does not.
#
# Given a string s, return the longest substring of s that is nice. If there are multiple, return the substring of the earliest occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "YazaAay"
# Output: "aAa"
# Explanation: "aAa" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s, and both 'A' and 'a' appear.
# "aAa" is the longest nice substring.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 100
# 	s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

# - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, simulation, enumeration)
#   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring within a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity for this task.
#   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all maximal palindromic substrings centered at each position in a string by leveraging symmetry and previously computed results. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: d_odd[i] stores the radius of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.; The (l, r) interval always defines the rightmost palindrome found so far.
#   • Tips: Preprocess the string with delimiters to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Maintain the current rightmost boundary `r` of the largest palindrome found.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update the `(l, r)` boundaries after processing each center.; Incorrectly calculating mirror positions or handling boundary cases for `i > r`.
# - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring in a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity by leveraging symmetry.
#   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all palindromic substrings in a string by expanding around centers and utilizing symmetry to avoid redundant comparisons. It achieves a linear time complexity of O(N) by maintaining the rightmost boundary of the longest palindrome found so far.
#   • Invariants: For any index k < i, d[k] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at k.; The pair (l, r) always represents the exclusive boundaries of the palindrome that extends furthest to the right among all processed centers.
#   • Tips: Pre-process the string with delimiters (e.g., '#') to uniformly handle both odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage symmetry: for a center 'i' within the current rightmost palindrome, its mirror 'j' provides a lower bound for the palindrome length at 'i'.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when the mirror palindrome extends beyond the current rightmost palindrome.; Forgetting to update the 'l' and 'r' boundaries after finding a new palindrome that extends further to the right.
# - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
#   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
#   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
#   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.

# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
