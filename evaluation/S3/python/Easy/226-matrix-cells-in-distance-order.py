# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-cells-in-distance-order/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given four integers row, cols, rCenter, and cCenter. There is a rows x cols matrix and you are on the cell with the coordinates (rCenter, cCenter).
#
# Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from (rCenter, cCenter) from the smallest distance to the largest distance. You may return the answer in any order that satisfies this condition.
#
# The distance between two cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.
#
# Example:
# Input: rows = 1, cols = 2, rCenter = 0, cCenter = 0
# Output: [[0,0],[0,1]]
# Explanation: The distances from (0, 0) to other cells are: [0,1]
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= rows, cols <= 100
# 	0 <= rCenter < rows
# 	0 <= cCenter < cols

# - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
#   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
#   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
#   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
#   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
# - Manhattan Distance (geometry, number, coordinate-compress)
#   • When to use: Use when calculating distance between two points on a grid where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical directions. It is also useful for problems involving maximizing or minimizing sums of absolute coordinate differences, often transformable to Chebyshev distance.
#   • Idea: Manhattan distance measures the sum of absolute differences of Cartesian coordinates between two points. It can be transformed into a Chebyshev distance problem by rotating coordinates, enabling efficient O(N) max/min distance calculations.
#   • Invariants: For any two points P1=(x1, y1) and P2=(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is always non-negative.; The transformed points P1'=(x1+y1, y1-x1) and P2'=(x2+y2, y2-x2) satisfy Chebyshev(P1', P2') == Manhattan(P1, P2).
#   • Tips: Consider transforming to Chebyshev distance for max/min distance problems.; The transformation involves rotating coordinates: (x, y) -> (x+y, y-x).
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing with Euclidean distance, which allows diagonal movement.; Incorrectly applying coordinate transformation (e.g., wrong signs).
# - Finding the rank of a matrix (matrix, simulation, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to determine the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix. It's also applicable for understanding the dimension of the vector space spanned by the matrix's rows or columns.
#   • Idea: Determines the rank of a matrix by transforming it into row echelon form using Gaussian elimination. The rank is the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form, with a time complexity of O(N^3).
#   • Invariants: The number of non-zero rows processed so far equals the current rank.; All elements below the pivot in the current column are zeroed out.
#   • Tips: Always choose the largest absolute value pivot for numerical stability.; Swap rows to bring a non-zero element to the pivot position.
#   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect zero checks.; Forgetting to increment rank only when a valid pivot is found.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
