# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
#
# If the town judge exists, then:
#
#
# 	The town judge trusts nobody.
# 	Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
# 	There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
#
#
# You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.
#
# Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
# Output: 2
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 1000
# 	0 <= trust.length <= 104
# 	trust[i].length == 2
# 	All the pairs of trust are unique.
# 	ai != bi
# 	1 <= ai, bi <= n

# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to uniquely encode or decode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers, or to count the number of spanning trees for a complete graph. It's also useful for problems involving tree properties like degree sequences.
#   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence representing a labeled tree, allowing conversion between a tree and a sequence of numbers. Its generation and decoding typically involve an iterative process of finding and removing leaves, achieving O(N log N) or O(N) complexity with optimized leaf finding.
#   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always has N-2 elements for an N-vertex tree.; Each vertex's degree is correctly maintained throughout the process.
#   • Tips: Maintain a degree array to efficiently find leaves.; Use a min-priority queue or a two-pointer approach for finding the smallest leaf.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in sequence length or vertex indexing.; Incorrectly handling the last two vertices during decoding.
# - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (matrix, array, dp-2d, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to count elements satisfying "at least one" of several properties, especially when direct counting is complicated by overlapping sets. It's also applicable for counting elements satisfying "none" of the properties by subtracting from the total.
#   • Idea: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle is a combinatorial method to determine the size of the union of multiple finite sets. It works by summing the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all pairwise intersections, adding back the sizes of all three-way intersections, and so on, with alternating signs.
#   • Invariants: The count for any element satisfying `k` properties is adjusted to be exactly 1 in the final sum.; Each term in the sum corresponds to the size of an intersection of a distinct subset of properties.
#   • Tips: Clearly define the universe and the properties (sets) you are interested in.; Systematically list all combinations of properties for intersection terms.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying or defining the properties or sets.; Missing certain intersection terms or double-counting them.
# - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
#   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
#   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
