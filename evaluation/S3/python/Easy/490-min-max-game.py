# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums whose length is a power of 2.
#
# Apply the following algorithm on nums:
#
#
# 	Let n be the length of nums. If n == 1, end the process. Otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array newNums of length n / 2.
# 	For every even index i where 0 <= i < n / 2, assign the value of newNums[i] as min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]).
# 	For every odd index i where 0 <= i < n / 2, assign the value of newNums[i] as max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]).
# 	Replace the array nums with newNums.
# 	Repeat the entire process starting from step 1.
#
#
# Return the last number that remains in nums after applying the algorithm.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,2,4,8,2,2]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The following arrays are the results of applying the algorithm repeatedly.
# First: nums = [1,5,4,2]
# Second: nums = [1,4]
# Third: nums = [1]
# 1 is the last remaining number, so we return 1.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 1024
# 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
# 	nums.length is a power of 2.

# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, prefix-sum, max-window)
#   • When to use: When needing to find the maximum or minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within a given array efficiently. It is particularly useful for problems requiring an O(N) solution.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subarray by iterating through the array, maintaining a running prefix sum, and tracking the minimum (or maximum) prefix sum encountered so far. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity with O(1) auxiliary space.
#   • Invariants: max_global_sum stores the maximum subarray sum found among all subarrays ending at or before the current element.; min_prefix_sum_value correctly tracks the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the previous element's prefix sum.
#   • Tips: Use a running sum variable instead of explicitly storing the entire prefix sum array.; Keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered up to the current point.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the minimum prefix sum (e.g., to INT_MAX instead of 0 or s[0]).; Off-by-one errors when calculating subarray sums using prefix sums (s[r] - s[l-1]).
# - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when performing many range queries on a static array where the query operation is idempotent (e.g., min, max, GCD) to achieve O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
#   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths, allowing O(1) query time for idempotent operations like range minimum/maximum queries. Precomputation takes O(N log N) time and space.
#   • Invariants: The `st[k][i]` entry stores the result of the operation for the range `[i, i + 2^k - 1]`.; All ranges of length `2^k` starting at `i` are correctly computed in `st[k][i]` during precomputation.
#   • Tips: Precompute logarithms for O(1) lookup of `floor(log2(length))` during queries.; Sparse tables are most efficient for idempotent operations (min, max, GCD, OR, AND) due to overlapping segments.
#   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for dynamic arrays or scenarios requiring updates, as modifications invalidate the precomputed table.; High memory usage: requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.
# - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
#   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
#   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
#   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
#   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
