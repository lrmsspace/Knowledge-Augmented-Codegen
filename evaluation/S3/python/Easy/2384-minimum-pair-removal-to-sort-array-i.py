# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-pair-removal-to-sort-array-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# Given an array nums, you can perform the following operation any number of times:
#
#
# 	Select the adjacent pair with the minimum sum in nums. If multiple such pairs exist, choose the leftmost one.
# 	Replace the pair with their sum.
#
#
# Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array non-decreasing.
#
# An array is said to be non-decreasing if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element (if it exists).
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation:
#
#
# 	The pair (3,1) has the minimum sum of 4. After replacement, nums = [5,2,4].
# 	The pair (2,4) has the minimum sum of 6. After replacement, nums = [5,6].
#
#
# The array nums became non-decreasing in two operations.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 50
# 	-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

# - Minimum stack / Minimum queue (stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need to perform standard stack operations (push, pop) and also query the minimum element currently in the stack, all in constant time.
#   • Idea: Augments a standard stack by storing each element along with the minimum value encountered up to that point in the stack. This allows O(1) retrieval of the current minimum, while push and pop operations also remain O(1).
#   • Invariants: The top element's second component (minimum_so_far) always represents the minimum value currently in the entire stack.; For any element (value, min_so_far) in the stack, min_so_far is the minimum of 'value' and all elements below it.
#   • Tips: Store elements as pairs: (actual_value, minimum_at_this_level).; When pushing, the new minimum_at_this_level is min(new_value, stack.top().second) if stack is not empty, else new_value.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case when calculating the minimum for a new element.; Incorrectly assuming the minimum can be tracked with a single auxiliary variable without considering pops.
# - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure is required, and dynamic size with efficient O(1) push and pop operations is crucial, especially without a fixed capacity.
#   • Idea: This describes implementing a stack using a singly linked list, where elements are added and removed from the head of the list. Both push and pop operations achieve O(1) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The 'first' pointer always points to the top element of the stack, or is null if the stack is empty.; Each node's 'next' pointer correctly links to the subsequent element in the stack, maintaining the LIFO order.
#   • Tips: Maintain a 'first' pointer to the head of the linked list, representing the stack's top.; Push operation involves creating a new node, linking it to the current 'first', then updating 'first'.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case for pop, leading to `NoSuchElementException`.; Incorrectly updating the 'first' pointer during push or pop, which can break the list structure.
# - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
#   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
#   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
#   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
