# Problem Description:
# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
#
# An input string is valid if:
#
#
# 	Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# 	Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# 	Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "()"
#
# Output: true
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# 	s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
#   • When to use: Use this when verifying if a sequence of delimiters is correctly nested and balanced. It is also applicable for counting or generating all possible valid sequences of a given length.
#   • Idea: This algorithm involves checking if a sequence of opening and closing delimiters is properly matched and nested, or enumerating such sequences. Validation typically uses a stack in O(N) time, while generation often involves backtracking with O(Catalan(N)) complexity.
#   • Invariants: The stack contains only opening delimiters that are yet to be matched.; The balance counter (open - close) is never negative at any point during traversal.
#   • Tips: Use a stack to track unmatched opening delimiters for validation.; Maintain a balance counter (increment for open, decrement for close) for a simpler check.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if the stack is empty after processing the entire sequence.; Allowing a closing delimiter when no matching opening delimiter is available (empty stack or mismatch).
# - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: This algorithm is used to evaluate expressions given in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation) to compute their final numerical value.
#   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an expression in Reverse Polish Notation by processing elements sequentially. Numbers are pushed onto a stack, and operators pop two operands, compute, and push the result.
#   • Invariants: The stack always contains only numbers (operands or intermediate results).; For a valid RPN expression, the stack will have at least two elements when an operator is processed.
#   • Tips: Process the RPN expression from left to right, token by token.; Push numerical operands directly onto the stack.
#   • Pitfalls: Attempting to pop from an empty stack when an operator is encountered, indicating an invalid RPN expression.; Incorrect order of operands for non-commutative operations like subtraction or division.
# - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
#   • When to use: When evaluating or converting arithmetic or logical expressions involving various operators, including unary and binary, and handling different associativities. It's useful for implementing calculators or compilers.
#   • Idea: This technique involves using stacks to parse and evaluate expressions, correctly handling operator precedence and associativity, including unary and right-associative operators. It typically processes expressions in O(N) time, where N is the expression length.
#   • Invariants: The operator stack always maintains operators in increasing order of precedence from bottom to top (excluding parentheses).; When processing an operand, it is immediately pushed onto the operand stack.
#   • Tips: Distinguish unary from binary operators based on context (e.g., preceding token).; Assign higher precedence to unary operators than most binary ones.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying unary vs. binary operators based on context.; Failing to correctly implement operator precedence rules.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
