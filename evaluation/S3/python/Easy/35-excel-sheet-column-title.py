# Problem Description:
# Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.
#
# For example:
#
#
# A -> 1
# B -> 2
# C -> 3
# ...
# Z -> 26
# AA -> 27
# AB -> 28 
# ...
#
# Example:
# Input: columnNumber = 1
# Output: "A"
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= columnNumber <= 231 - 1

# - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
#   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
#   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
# - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use when counting labeled trees or converting between a labeled tree and a unique sequence representation for combinatorial analysis. It provides a bijection for problems involving N labeled nodes.
#   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence of length N-2 that represents a labeled tree with N nodes. It is constructed by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor, and can be reconstructed back into the tree.
#   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always contains N-2 elements for a tree with N nodes.; At each step of encoding, the removed node is a leaf with the smallest label among all current leaves.
#   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for efficient updates.; Use a min-priority queue to quickly find the smallest-labeled leaf.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating node degrees after removal.; Off-by-one errors when dealing with 0-indexed vs. 1-indexed labels.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
