# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the sum of all its cousins' values.
#
# Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth with different parents.
#
# Return the root of the modified tree.
#
# Note that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to it.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [5,4,9,1,10,null,7]
# Output: [0,0,0,7,7,null,11]
# Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
# - Node with value 5 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
# - Node with value 4 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
# - Node with value 9 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
# - Node with value 1 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
# - Node with value 10 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
# - Node with value 7 has cousins with values 1 and 10 so its sum is 11.
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].
# 	1 <= Node.val <= 104

# - Breadth-first search (graph, array, bfs, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or traversing a graph level by level to explore all reachable nodes. It is also suitable for finding connected components or checking reachability.
#   • Idea: Breadth-first search explores a graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in terms of edges from a source node to all other reachable nodes. It typically runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
#   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or next level of traversal from the source.; All nodes already dequeued have been fully processed, and their unvisited neighbors have been enqueued.
#   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit in a FIFO manner.; Mark nodes as visited immediately upon adding them to the queue to prevent redundant processing and cycles.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs or incorrect path lengths.; Not handling disconnected components if the goal is to traverse the entire graph.
# - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
#   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
#   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
#   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
#   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
# - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, binary-lifting, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use binary lifting when you need to answer multiple Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries or ancestor relationship checks efficiently on a static tree.
#   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestor pointers using DFS to answer Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries and ancestor checks in O(log N) time per query, after O(N log N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: For any node `u` and power `k`, `up[u][k]` is the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; `depth[u]` correctly represents the distance from the root to node `u`.
#   • Tips: Precompute `up[u][k]` as the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; Use DFS to fill the `up` array and node depths.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating `log N` for array dimensions.; Failing to handle the root node's ancestors (e.g., `up[root][k]` should be itself or an invalid node).
