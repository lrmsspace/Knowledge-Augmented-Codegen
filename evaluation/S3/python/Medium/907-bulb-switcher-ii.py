#
# Problem Description:
# There is a room with n bulbs labeled from 1 to n that all are turned on initially, and four buttons on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:
#
#
# 	Button 1: Flips the status of all the bulbs.
# 	Button 2: Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., 2, 4, ...).
# 	Button 3: Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., 1, 3, ...).
# 	Button 4: Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label j = 3k + 1 where k = 0, 1, 2, ... (i.e., 1, 4, 7, 10, ...).
#
#
# You must make exactly presses button presses in total. For each press, you may pick any of the four buttons to press.
#
# Given the two integers n and presses, return the number of different possible statuses after performing all presses button presses.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 1, presses = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Status can be:
# - [off] by pressing button 1
# - [on] by pressing button 2
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 1000
# 	0 <= presses <= 1000

# - Bit manipulation (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: When problems involve manipulating individual bits of numbers, representing sets as bitmasks, or optimizing operations on powers of two. It is also useful for certain combinatorics and dynamic programming problems.
#   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators. This technique is often used to optimize computations, manage boolean flags efficiently, or represent subsets, typically achieving O(1) complexity for fixed-size integers.
#   • Invariants: Each bit in the mask accurately reflects the inclusion or exclusion status of its corresponding element.; Bitwise operations maintain the integrity of unaffected bits.
#   • Tips: Use (1 << k) to create a mask with the k-th bit set.; n & (n-1) clears the least significant set bit.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrect operator precedence can lead to subtle bugs.; Mixing signed and unsigned integers in bitwise operations can yield unexpected results.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
# - Gray code (number, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
#   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
#   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
#   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
