# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.
#
# The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.
#
# The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.
#
# It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].
# 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

# - Breadth-first search (graph, array, bfs, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or traversing a graph level by level to explore all reachable nodes. It is also suitable for finding connected components or checking reachability.
#   • Idea: Breadth-first search explores a graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in terms of edges from a source node to all other reachable nodes. It typically runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
#   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or next level of traversal from the source.; All nodes already dequeued have been fully processed, and their unvisited neighbors have been enqueued.
#   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit in a FIFO manner.; Mark nodes as visited immediately upon adding them to the queue to prevent redundant processing and cycles.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs or incorrect path lengths.; Not handling disconnected components if the goal is to traverse the entire graph.
# - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
#   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
#   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
#   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
#   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
# - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
#   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
#   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
#   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
