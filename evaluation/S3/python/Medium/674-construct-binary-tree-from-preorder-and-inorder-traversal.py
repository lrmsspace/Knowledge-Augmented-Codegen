# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.
#
# Example:
# Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
# Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= preorder.length <= 3000
# 	inorder.length == preorder.length
# 	-3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000
# 	preorder and inorder consist of unique values.
# 	Each value of inorder also appears in preorder.
# 	preorder is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.
# 	inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.

# - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
#   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
#   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
#   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
#   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
# - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
#   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
#   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
# - Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) (array, tree, lca)
#   • When to use: Use this technique for efficiently answering multiple Range Minimum Queries on a static array, especially when an asymptotically optimal O(1) query time solution is required.
#   • Idea: This algorithm solves the static Range Minimum Query problem by first constructing a Cartesian tree from the input array, then reducing RMQ queries to Lowest Common Ancestor queries on this tree. It achieves an optimal O(N) preprocessing time and O(1) query time.
#   • Invariants: For any node `u` in the Cartesian tree, `value(u)` is the minimum among all values in the original array segment represented by `u`'s subtree.; The in-order traversal of the Cartesian tree nodes' original array indices yields the original array `A`'s indices in increasing order.
#   • Tips: Construct the Cartesian tree efficiently in O(N) time, typically using a stack-based approach.; The value of the LCA of two nodes in the Cartesian tree corresponds to the minimum in the original array range between their indices.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Cartesian tree, especially when handling duplicate values or edge cases like empty arrays.; The Farach-Colton and Bender LCA algorithm is complex to implement and often requires significant effort.
