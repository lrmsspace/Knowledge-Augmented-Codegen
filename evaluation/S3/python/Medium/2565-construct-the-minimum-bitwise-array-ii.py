# Problem Description:
# You are given an array nums consisting of n prime integers.
#
# You need to construct an array ans of length n, such that, for each index i, the bitwise OR of ans[i] and ans[i] + 1 is equal to nums[i], i.e. ans[i] OR (ans[i] + 1) == nums[i].
#
# Additionally, you must minimize each value of ans[i] in the resulting array.
#
# If it is not possible to find such a value for ans[i] that satisfies the condition, then set ans[i] = -1.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,3,5,7]
#
# Output: [-1,1,4,3]
#
# Explanation:
#
#
# 	For i = 0, as there is no value for ans[0] that satisfies ans[0] OR (ans[0] + 1) = 2, so ans[0] = -1.
# 	For i = 1, the smallest ans[1] that satisfies ans[1] OR (ans[1] + 1) = 3 is 1, because 1 OR (1 + 1) = 3.
# 	For i = 2, the smallest ans[2] that satisfies ans[2] OR (ans[2] + 1) = 5 is 4, because 4 OR (4 + 1) = 5.
# 	For i = 3, the smallest ans[3] that satisfies ans[3] OR (ans[3] + 1) = 7 is 3, because 3 OR (3 + 1) = 7.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 100
# 	2 <= nums[i] <= 109
# 	nums[i] is a prime number.

# - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, sieve, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit or precompute primality for a range. It is efficient for generating primes within a reasonable upper bound.
#   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer by iteratively marking multiples of primes as composite. It achieves a time complexity of O(N log log N).
#   • Invariants: All numbers less than the current prime 'p' have already been processed.; If 'i' is marked as prime, then all its multiples less than 'i*i' have been marked composite by smaller primes.
#   • Tips: Optimize by starting inner loop from p*p, as smaller multiples would have been marked.; Use a boolean array for primality, or an integer array to store smallest prime factor (SPF).
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0 and 1, which are neither prime nor composite.; Off-by-one errors when setting array bounds or loop conditions.
# - Linear Sieve (array, sieve)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a given limit N, or compute the least prime factor for all numbers in that range, efficiently in linear time.
#   • Idea: The Linear Sieve finds all prime numbers up to N in O(N) time by ensuring each composite number is marked exactly once by its least prime factor. It also computes the least prime factor for every number up to N.
#   • Invariants: The 'primes' list always contains all prime numbers found so far in increasing order.; lpf[i] stores the least prime factor of 'i' if 'i' is composite, or 'i' itself if 'i' is prime.
#   • Tips: Store the least prime factor (LPF) for each number in an array.; Maintain a dynamically growing list of primes found so far.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly marking multiples can lead to O(N log log N) or worse complexity.; Forgetting to store the least prime factor can break the linear time guarantee.
# - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, bitset, sieve)
#   • When to use: When you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit N, or efficiently check primality for many numbers within that range. It is ideal for precomputing primes.
#   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer N by iteratively marking multiples of each prime. It achieves O(N log log N) time complexity and O(N) space.
#   • Invariants: For any number i less than the current prime p, is_prime[i] correctly reflects its primality.; All multiples of primes smaller than the current prime p have already been marked as composite.
#   • Tips: Optimize by starting marking multiples from p*p for each prime p.; Use a bitset for memory efficiency when N is large.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to explicitly handle 0 and 1 as non-prime.; Incorrectly marking multiples, e.g., starting from 2*p instead of p*p.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
