# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-amount-of-time-to-collect-garbage/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed array of strings garbage where garbage[i] represents the assortment of garbage at the ith house. garbage[i] consists only of the characters 'M', 'P' and 'G' representing one unit of metal, paper and glass garbage respectively. Picking up one unit of any type of garbage takes 1 minute.
#
# You are also given a 0-indexed integer array travel where travel[i] is the number of minutes needed to go from house i to house i + 1.
#
# There are three garbage trucks in the city, each responsible for picking up one type of garbage. Each garbage truck starts at house 0 and must visit each house in order; however, they do not need to visit every house.
#
# Only one garbage truck may be used at any given moment. While one truck is driving or picking up garbage, the other two trucks cannot do anything.
#
# Return the minimum number of minutes needed to pick up all the garbage.
#
# Example:
# Input: garbage = ["G","P","GP","GG"], travel = [2,4,3]
# Output: 21
# Explanation:
# The paper garbage truck:
# 1. Travels from house 0 to house 1
# 2. Collects the paper garbage at house 1
# 3. Travels from house 1 to house 2
# 4. Collects the paper garbage at house 2
# Altogether, it takes 8 minutes to pick up all the paper garbage.
# The glass garbage truck:
# 1. Collects the glass garbage at house 0
# 2. Travels from house 0 to house 1
# 3. Travels from house 1 to house 2
# 4. Collects the glass garbage at house 2
# 5. Travels from house 2 to house 3
# 6. Collects the glass garbage at house 3
# Altogether, it takes 13 minutes to pick up all the glass garbage.
# Since there is no metal garbage, we do not need to consider the metal garbage truck.
# Therefore, it takes a total of 8 + 13 = 21 minutes to collect all the garbage.
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= garbage.length <= 105
# 	garbage[i] consists of only the letters 'M', 'P', and 'G'.
# 	1 <= garbage[i].length <= 10
# 	travel.length == garbage.length - 1
# 	1 <= travel[i] <= 100

# - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
#   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
#   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
#   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
# - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
#   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
#   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
#   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
#   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
# - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
#   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
#   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
#   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
#   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
