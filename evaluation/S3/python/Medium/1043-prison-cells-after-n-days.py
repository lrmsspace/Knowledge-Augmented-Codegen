# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# There are 8 prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant.
#
# Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:
#
#
# 	If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
# 	Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
#
#
# Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.
#
# You are given an integer array cells where cells[i] == 1 if the ith cell is occupied and cells[i] == 0 if the ith cell is vacant, and you are given an integer n.
#
# Return the state of the prison after n days (i.e., n such changes described above).
#
# Example:
# Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], n = 7
# Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
# Explanation: The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
# Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
# Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
# Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
# Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
# Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
# Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
# Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
# Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
#
# Constraints:
# cells.length == 8
# 	cells[i] is either 0 or 1.
# 	1 <= n <= 109

# Helpful references (internal KB):
# - Gray code (number, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
#   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
#   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
#   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.
# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
# - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, queue, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when frequent insertions or deletions at the beginning or end of a collection are required, or when the collection size is highly dynamic and unpredictable.
#   • Idea: Linked lists implement dynamic collections like queues and stacks by chaining nodes, each holding an item and a reference to the next node. Operations like adding or removing elements at the ends typically achieve O(1) time complexity, while random access is O(N).
#   • Invariants: The `first` pointer always references the head node, or is null if the list is empty.; The `last` pointer always references the tail node, or is null if the list is empty.
#   • Tips: Maintain separate `first` and `last` pointers for O(1) enqueue/dequeue operations.; Keep a `size` counter to provide O(1) size retrieval.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update `first` or `last` pointers correctly can lead to broken lists or memory leaks.; Null pointer exceptions are common when traversing or modifying an empty or partially traversed list.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
