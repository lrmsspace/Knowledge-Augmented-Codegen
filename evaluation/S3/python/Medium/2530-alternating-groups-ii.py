#
# Problem Description:
# There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers colors and an integer k. The color of tile i is represented by colors[i]:
#
#
# 	colors[i] == 0 means that tile i is red.
# 	colors[i] == 1 means that tile i is blue.
#
#
# An alternating group is every k contiguous tiles in the circle with alternating colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one has a different color from its left and right tiles).
#
# Return the number of alternating groups.
#
# Note that since colors represents a circle, the first and the last tiles are considered to be next to each other.
#
# Example:
# Input: colors = [0,1,0,1,0], k = 3
#
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation:
#
#
#
# Alternating groups:
#
# Constraints:
# 3 <= colors.length <= 105
# 	0 <= colors[i] <= 1
# 	3 <= k <= colors.length

# - Burnside's lemma / Pólya enumeration theorem (array, number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting the number of distinct configurations or arrangements of objects under a set of symmetry operations, where configurations are considered identical if one can be transformed into another by a group action.
#   • Idea: Burnside's Lemma and Pólya Enumeration Theorem are combinatorial tools used to count the number of distinct objects under a group of symmetries. Both typically involve iterating through group elements and analyzing permutation cycle structures, often resulting in polynomial time complexity depending on group size and element analysis.
#   • Invariants: The set of group elements considered remains consistent throughout the summation.; Each group element's cycle decomposition is correctly identified.
#   • Tips: Identify the group of symmetry operations acting on the objects.; For each group element, determine its permutation cycle structure.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the full set of distinct group operations.; Errors in determining the cycle structure of permutations.
# - Josephus Problem (number, simulation, recursion)
#   • When to use: Use when determining the survivor's position in a circular game where every k-th person is eliminated, especially for large N where direct simulation is too slow.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the position of the last remaining person in the Josephus problem by iteratively reducing the problem size using a recursive formula and modulo arithmetic. It achieves an optimized time complexity of O(k log n).
#   • Invariants: The number of remaining elements decreases in each recursive step.; The relative order of the remaining elements is preserved throughout the process.
#   • Tips: Handle the base case where n < k separately to avoid infinite loops or incorrect calculations.; Use 0-indexing for simpler modulo arithmetic in the recursive formulas.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling index shifts after elements are removed can lead to wrong results.; Forgetting the base case n < k can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect behavior.
# - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
#   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
#   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
