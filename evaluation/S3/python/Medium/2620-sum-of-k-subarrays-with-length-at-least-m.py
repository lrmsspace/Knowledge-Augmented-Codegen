# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-k-subarrays-with-length-at-least-m/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array nums and two integers, k and m.
#
# Return the maximum sum of k non-overlapping subarrays of nums, where each subarray has a length of at least m.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,2,-1,3,3,4], k = 2, m = 2
#
# Output: 13
#
# Explanation:
#
# The optimal choice is:
#
#
# 	Subarray nums[3..5] with sum 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 (length is 3 >= m).
# 	Subarray nums[0..1] with sum 1 + 2 = 3 (length is 2 >= m).
#
#
# The total sum is 10 + 3 = 13.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 2000
# 	-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# 	1 <= k <= floor(nums.length / m)
# 	1 <= m <= 3

# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
#   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
#   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
#   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
# - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
#   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
#   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: Use when frequent range queries and point/range updates are needed on an array, offering a balanced O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations. It's a good alternative when a segment tree is too complex or overkill.
#   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and updates. It achieves an O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both query and update operations.
#   • Invariants: Each block maintains an up-to-date aggregate of its elements.; For any query, fully contained blocks are processed using their precomputed aggregates.
#   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for optimal balance.; Precompute block aggregates (sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling partial blocks or boundary conditions.; Off-by-one errors in block indices or element indices within blocks.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
