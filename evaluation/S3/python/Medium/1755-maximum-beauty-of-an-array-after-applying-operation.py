# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-beauty-of-an-array-after-applying-operation/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed array nums and a non-negative integer k.
#
# In one operation, you can do the following:
#
#
# 	Choose an index i that hasn't been chosen before from the range [0, nums.length - 1].
# 	Replace nums[i] with any integer from the range [nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k].
#
#
# The beauty of the array is the length of the longest subsequence consisting of equal elements.
#
# Return the maximum possible beauty of the array nums after applying the operation any number of times.
#
# Note that you can apply the operation to each index only once.
#
# A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [4,6,1,2], k = 2
# Output: 3
# Explanation: In this example, we apply the following operations:
# - Choose index 1, replace it with 4 (from range [4,8]), nums = [4,4,1,2].
# - Choose index 3, replace it with 4 (from range [0,4]), nums = [4,4,1,4].
# After the applied operations, the beauty of the array nums is 3 (subsequence consisting of indices 0, 1, and 3).
# It can be proven that 3 is the maximum possible length we can achieve.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	0 <= nums[i], k <= 105

# - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: Use Merge Sort when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or linked lists where random access is costly.
#   • Idea: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N).
#   • Invariants: Each sub-array passed to merge is sorted.; The merge operation combines two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array.
#   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to maintain stability.; Consider iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits.
#   • Pitfalls: High space complexity due to auxiliary arrays.; Overhead of recursion can be significant for small inputs.
# - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer, merge-sort, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use this when finding the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance in a 2D plane. It efficiently handles large datasets by recursively dividing the problem and merging results.
#   • Idea: It finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively dividing the set, solving subproblems, and merging results in O(N log N) time. The merge step efficiently handles cross-boundary pairs within a narrow strip.
#   • Invariants: The minimum distance returned by a recursive call is the true minimum for its input subset.; All points in the left subproblem have x-coordinates less than or equal to the median x-coordinate.
#   • Tips: Pre-sort points by x-coordinate to enable efficient splitting.; Maintain a y-sorted list of points for efficient merging of the strip.
#   • Pitfalls: An inefficient merge step can degrade complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2).; Failing to correctly identify and process cross-boundary pairs.
# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, counting, segment-tree)
#   • When to use: Use when seeking the longest possible sequence of elements from a given array such that each element is greater than the preceding one, preserving their original relative order.
#   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem identifies the longest possible subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order, preserving their original relative positions. It can be solved efficiently in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree.
#   • Invariants: The `tails` array elements are always strictly increasing.; For any index `k`, `tails[k]` holds the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `k+1`.
#   • Tips: Use a `tails` array to store the smallest ending element for LIS of each length.; Employ binary search on the `tails` array to update or extend subsequences.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence (relative order) with contiguous subarray.; Incorrectly implementing strict vs. non-strict increasing conditions.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
