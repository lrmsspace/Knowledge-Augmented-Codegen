# Problem Description:
# Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
# 	-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
#
#
#  
# Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity?

# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It is applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered selections from a sequence.
#   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or with a greedy approach using binary search in O(N log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or equivalent) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index `i`, `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1` found so far.
#   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains a 'tails' array where tails[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Use binary search (specifically `lower_bound` for strictly increasing) to find the correct position to update the 'tails' array.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray; elements do not need to be contiguous.; Incorrectly applying binary search (e.g., using `upper_bound` instead of `lower_bound` for strict increase).
# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is particularly efficient when optimizing the O(N^2) dynamic programming solution to O(N log N) using binary search.
#   • Idea: This algorithm determines the longest subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search.
#   • Invariants: The 'tails' array always stores the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The 'tails' array is always sorted in strictly increasing order.
#   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array 'tails' where 'tails[i]' is the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.; Utilize binary search (e.g., `std::lower_bound`) to find the correct position for the current element in the 'tails' array.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing a subsequence with a contiguous subarray, which is a common mistake.; Incorrectly updating the 'tails' array, leading to non-increasing subsequences or incorrect lengths.
# - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence such that elements in the subsequence are in strictly increasing order. It is often applied to optimization problems involving ordered subsets.
#   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence where all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search optimization, or O(N^2) using basic DP.
#   • Invariants: The 'tails' array always stores the smallest ending element for all increasing subsequences of a given length.; The 'tails' array remains sorted in strictly increasing order throughout the algorithm's execution.
#   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach uses a 'tails' array to store the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of length 'i+1'.; Binary search is crucial for efficiently finding the correct position for the current element in the 'tails' array.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with contiguous subarray or substring.; Incorrectly updating or searching in the 'tails' array, leading to wrong lengths or values.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
