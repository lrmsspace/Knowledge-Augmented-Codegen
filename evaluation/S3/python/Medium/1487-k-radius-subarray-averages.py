# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/k-radius-subarray-averages/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers, and an integer k.
#
# The k-radius average for a subarray of nums centered at some index i with the radius k is the average of all elements in nums between the indices i - k and i + k (inclusive). If there are less than k elements before or after the index i, then the k-radius average is -1.
#
# Build and return an array avgs of length n where avgs[i] is the k-radius average for the subarray centered at index i.
#
# The average of x elements is the sum of the x elements divided by x, using integer division. The integer division truncates toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.
#
#
# 	For example, the average of four elements 2, 3, 1, and 5 is (2 + 3 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75, which truncates to 2.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [7,4,3,9,1,8,5,2,6], k = 3
# Output: [-1,-1,-1,5,4,4,-1,-1,-1]
# Explanation:
# - avg[0], avg[1], and avg[2] are -1 because there are less than k elements before each index.
# - The sum of the subarray centered at index 3 with radius 3 is: 7 + 4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 37.
#   Using integer division, avg[3] = 37 / 7 = 5.
# - For the subarray centered at index 4, avg[4] = (4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2) / 7 = 4.
# - For the subarray centered at index 5, avg[5] = (3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 6) / 7 = 4.
# - avg[6], avg[7], and avg[8] are -1 because there are less than k elements after each index.
#
# Constraints:
# n == nums.length
# 	1 <= n <= 105
# 	0 <= nums[i], k <= 105

# Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
#   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
#   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
#   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
#   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
#   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
#   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: Use when frequent range queries and point/range updates are needed on an array, offering a balanced O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations. It's a good alternative when a segment tree is too complex or overkill.
#   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and updates. It achieves an O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both query and update operations.
#   • Invariants: Each block maintains an up-to-date aggregate of its elements.; For any query, fully contained blocks are processed using their precomputed aggregates.
#   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for optimal balance.; Precompute block aggregates (sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling partial blocks or boundary conditions.; Off-by-one errors in block indices or element indices within blocks.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
