# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.
#
# Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# 	s consists of only uppercase English letters.
# 	0 <= k <= s.length

# - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
#   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
#   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
#   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
#   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
# - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
#   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring in a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity by leveraging symmetry.
#   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all palindromic substrings in a string by expanding around centers and utilizing symmetry to avoid redundant comparisons. It achieves a linear time complexity of O(N) by maintaining the rightmost boundary of the longest palindrome found so far.
#   • Invariants: For any index k < i, d[k] correctly stores the radius of the longest palindrome centered at k.; The pair (l, r) always represents the exclusive boundaries of the palindrome that extends furthest to the right among all processed centers.
#   • Tips: Pre-process the string with delimiters (e.g., '#') to uniformly handle both odd and even length palindromes.; Leverage symmetry: for a center 'i' within the current rightmost palindrome, its mirror 'j' provides a lower bound for the palindrome length at 'i'.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when the mirror palindrome extends beyond the current rightmost palindrome.; Forgetting to update the 'l' and 'r' boundaries after finding a new palindrome that extends further to the right.
# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, ds, sliding-window, two-pointers)
#   • When to use: Use when performing frequent range queries and point updates on an array, especially when a segment tree is too complex or memory-intensive, or when query types are diverse. It offers a balanced time complexity for both operations.
#   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and point updates. It achieves O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations.
#   • Invariants: Each element `arr[i]` belongs to exactly one block `block[i / block_size]`.; The summary for each block `block_summary[j]` accurately reflects the state of elements within block `j`.
#   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for balanced performance.; Precompute block summaries (e.g., sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or boundaries.; Forgetting to update the block's summary after a point update.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
