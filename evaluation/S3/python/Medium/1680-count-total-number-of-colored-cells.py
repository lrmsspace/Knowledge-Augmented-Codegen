# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-total-number-of-colored-cells/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer n, indicating that you must do the following routine for n minutes:
#
#
# 	At the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.
# 	Every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.
#
#
# Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.
#
# Return the number of colored cells at the end of n minutes.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 1
# Output: 1
# Explanation: After 1 minute, there is only 1 blue cell, so we return 1.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 105

# - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
#   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
#   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
#   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
#   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
#   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
# - Josephus Problem (number, recursion, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when simulating a circular elimination process with a fixed step size, especially when seeking the survivor's position. It's particularly efficient for specific step sizes like two.
#   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the last remaining position in a circular arrangement after elements are eliminated at fixed intervals. The recursive solution for a step size of two has a logarithmic time complexity, O(log N), due to its divide-and-conquer nature.
#   • Invariants: The number of participants N is always positive in each recursive subproblem.; The returned position is always within the valid range [0, current N-1] (or [1, current N]).
#   • Tips: Base cases are crucial for recursive solutions, typically for N=1.; Observe patterns for specific step sizes, especially k=2, which has a simpler formula.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when converting between 0-indexed and 1-indexed results.; Incorrectly applying the position 'shift' after elements are eliminated in subproblems.
# - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, counting, dp-2d)
#   • When to use: Use when counting non-attacking piece placements on a grid, especially when the problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems based on board properties like diagonals.
#   • Idea: This algorithm employs 2D dynamic programming to count the total number of ways to place non-attacking bishops on a chessboard. It leverages the independence of placements on black and white squares/diagonals, achieving a polynomial time complexity.
#   • Invariants: For any diagonal `i`, `D[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonal `i`.; Bishops placed on black diagonals do not attack bishops placed on white diagonals.
#   • Tips: Decompose the problem into independent subproblems for black and white squares/diagonals.; Identify the state for DP, typically `dp[diagonal_index][bishops_placed]`.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the number of squares on each diagonal.; Overlapping bishops if diagonal definitions are not precise.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
