#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the longest path, where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.
#
# The length of the path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [5,4,5,1,1,null,5]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The shown image shows that the longest path of the same value (i.e. 5).
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
# 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# 	The depth of the tree will not exceed 1000.

# - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
#   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
#   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
#   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
#   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
# - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
#   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
#   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
#   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
#   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
# - Depth-first search (graph, array, stack, dfs)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to explore all reachable vertices from a starting point or systematically visit all nodes in a graph or tree. It's suitable for problems requiring full exploration of a branch before backtracking.
#   • Idea: Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically using a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion).
#   • Invariants: Every node `v` in the graph is either visited or not yet visited.; The recursion stack (or explicit stack) always contains a path from the source node to the current node being explored.
#   • Tips: Use a `visited` array or set to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often cleaner for implementation, but iterative DFS with an explicit stack avoids recursion depth limits.
#   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited leads to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
