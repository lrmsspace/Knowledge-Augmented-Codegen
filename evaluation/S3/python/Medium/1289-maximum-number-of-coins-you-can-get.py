# Problem Description:
# There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:
#
#
# 	In each step, you will choose any 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
# 	Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
# 	You will pick the next pile with the maximum number of coins.
# 	Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
# 	Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
#
#
# Given an array of integers piles where piles[i] is the number of coins in the ith pile.
#
# Return the maximum number of coins that you can have.
#
# Example:
# Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: Choose the triplet (2, 7, 8), Alice Pick the pile with 8 coins, you the pile with 7 coins and Bob the last one.
# Choose the triplet (1, 2, 4), Alice Pick the pile with 4 coins, you the pile with 2 coins and Bob the last one.
# The maximum number of coins which you can have are: 7 + 2 = 9.
# On the other hand if we choose this arrangement (1, 2, 8), (2, 4, 7) you only get 2 + 4 = 6 coins which is not optimal.
#
# Constraints:
# 3 <= piles.length <= 105
# 	piles.length % 3 == 0
# 	1 <= piles[i] <= 104

# - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: When tasks need to be processed sequentially on a single resource to optimize a cumulative metric like total completion time or weighted sum of completion times.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal sequence for processing jobs on a single machine by applying a greedy strategy, often involving sorting based on specific criteria. It typically achieves an optimal schedule in O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The list of jobs is sorted according to the chosen greedy criterion.; For any prefix of the sorted jobs, the current schedule minimizes the objective function for those jobs.
#   • Tips: Identify the correct sorting key (e.g., processing time, weight/time ratio) for the objective function.; Prove optimality using an exchange argument to justify the greedy choice.
#   • Pitfalls: Applying an incorrect sorting criterion for the specific optimization objective.; Assuming a greedy approach is always optimal without a formal proof.
# - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when tasks with associated processing times and costs need to be sequenced on a single machine to minimize a total objective function, typically involving weighted completion times or penalties. The optimal sequence is found by a greedy sort.
#   • Idea: This method finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine by sorting them according to a greedy criterion derived from an exchange argument. It achieves an optimal solution with O(N log N) time complexity, dominated by the sorting step.
#   • Invariants: The relative order of any two jobs i and j in the sorted sequence is consistent with the greedy comparison rule.; Any prefix of the sorted schedule represents an optimal ordering for the jobs within that prefix.
#   • Tips: Clearly define the objective function to be minimized.; Formulate the greedy sorting rule using an exchange argument for any two adjacent jobs.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly deriving the greedy comparison criterion.; Applying this method to problems with multiple machines or complex precedence constraints without adaptation.
# - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
#   • When to use: Use when scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine to minimize the total weighted completion time, where each job has a processing time and a linear penalty coefficient.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine with linear penalty functions by sorting jobs based on a specific ratio. It achieves an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The partial schedule constructed so far is optimal for the jobs included.; For any two adjacent jobs 'j' and 'k' in the final schedule, if 'j' precedes 'k', then 'c_j/t_j >= c_k/t_k'.
#   • Tips: Derive the sorting criterion using an exchange argument for adjacent jobs.; The optimal order is determined by the ratio of cost coefficient to processing time.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the sorting criterion, especially the ratio order.; Overlooking edge cases like zero processing times or zero penalty coefficients.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
