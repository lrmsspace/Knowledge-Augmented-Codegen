# Problem Description:
# You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix grid.
#
# A 0-indexed m x n difference matrix diff is created with the following procedure:
#
#
# 	Let the number of ones in the ith row be onesRowi.
# 	Let the number of ones in the jth column be onesColj.
# 	Let the number of zeros in the ith row be zerosRowi.
# 	Let the number of zeros in the jth column be zerosColj.
# 	diff[i][j] = onesRowi + onesColj - zerosRowi - zerosColj
#
#
# Return the difference matrix diff.
#
# Example:
# Input: grid = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]]
# Output: [[0,0,4],[0,0,4],[-2,-2,2]]
# Explanation:
# - diff[0][0] = onesRow0 + onesCol0 - zerosRow0 - zerosCol0 = 2 + 1 - 1 - 2 = 0 
# - diff[0][1] = onesRow0 + onesCol1 - zerosRow0 - zerosCol1 = 2 + 1 - 1 - 2 = 0 
# - diff[0][2] = onesRow0 + onesCol2 - zerosRow0 - zerosCol2 = 2 + 3 - 1 - 0 = 4 
# - diff[1][0] = onesRow1 + onesCol0 - zerosRow1 - zerosCol0 = 2 + 1 - 1 - 2 = 0 
# - diff[1][1] = onesRow1 + onesCol1 - zerosRow1 - zerosCol1 = 2 + 1 - 1 - 2 = 0 
# - diff[1][2] = onesRow1 + onesCol2 - zerosRow1 - zerosCol2 = 2 + 3 - 1 - 0 = 4 
# - diff[2][0] = onesRow2 + onesCol0 - zerosRow2 - zerosCol0 = 1 + 1 - 2 - 2 = -2
# - diff[2][1] = onesRow2 + onesCol1 - zerosRow2 - zerosCol1 = 1 + 1 - 2 - 2 = -2
# - diff[2][2] = onesRow2 + onesCol2 - zerosRow2 - zerosCol2 = 1 + 3 - 2 - 0 = 2
#
# Constraints:
# m == grid.length
# 	n == grid[i].length
# 	1 <= m, n <= 105
# 	1 <= m * n <= 105
# 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

# - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, number, sparse-table, counting)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries on a static array in O(1) time, after an initial O(N log N) preprocessing phase. It is particularly efficient for associative operations like sum, min, or max.
#   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes results for all possible range queries on a static array using a hierarchical block decomposition. It achieves O(N log N) construction time and space complexity, enabling O(1) query time for associative operations.
#   • Invariants: ST[k][i] stores the result for a range of length 2^k starting at i within its block.; For any level k, blocks are disjoint, but ranges within ST[k] can overlap with ranges in ST[k-1].
#   • Tips: Precompute log2 values or highest set bit for efficient level determination.; Ensure the operation (e.g., sum, min, max) is associative for correct combination.
#   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for arrays that require updates, as it's a static data structure.; Only works for associative operations; non-associative operations cannot be combined this way.
# - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
#   • When to use: Use when you need to perform many range queries on a static array, especially when the query operation is associative and idempotent, allowing for O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
#   • Idea: A Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths. It allows O(1) query time for idempotent operations like min/max/gcd and O(log N) for non-idempotent associative operations, after an O(N log N) build time.
#   • Invariants: After precomputation, dp[k][i] stores the result for the range [i, i + 2^k - 1].; For any k > 0, dp[k][i] is the result of combining dp[k-1][i] and dp[k-1][i + 2^(k-1)].
#   • Tips: Precompute log2 values for faster range length calculations.; Store dp[k][i] as the result for range [i, i + 2^k - 1].
#   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to array elements efficiently.; Requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.
# - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
#   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
#   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
#   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
#   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
#   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
