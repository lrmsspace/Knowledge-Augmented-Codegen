# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-missing-observations/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You have observations of n + m 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. n of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of m rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the n + m rolls.
#
# You are given an integer array rolls of length m where rolls[i] is the value of the ith observation. You are also given the two integers mean and n.
#
# Return an array of length n containing the missing observations such that the average value of the n + m rolls is exactly mean. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.
#
# The average value of a set of k numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by k.
#
# Note that mean is an integer, so the sum of the n + m rolls should be divisible by n + m.
#
# Example:
# Input: rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2
# Output: [6,6]
# Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 4.
#
# Constraints:
# m == rolls.length
# 	1 <= n, m <= 105
# 	1 <= rolls[i], mean <= 6

# - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
#   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
#   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
#   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
#   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
#   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
# - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
#   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
#   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
#   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
#   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
# - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
#   • When to use: When you need to calculate the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in sequential order. It efficiently handles both convex and non-convex polygons.
#   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing the signed areas of trapezoids or triangles formed by its edges and a reference point/axis. It achieves O(N) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: The sum accumulates the signed area contribution of processed edges.; The current vertex and the next vertex define an edge of the polygon.
#   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in sequential order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; The absolute value of the final result is the polygon's area.
#   • Pitfalls: Supplying vertices in a non-sequential or arbitrary order will yield an incorrect area.; Applying the formula to self-intersecting polygons will not give the true geometric area.

# Notes:
# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
# - Use only the Python standard library; no third-party packages.
# - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics as defined by the template/problem.
# - Conformance: use features compatible with LeetCode’s Python3 runtime; do NOT rely on undefined/implementation-specific behavior.
# - If you introduce any helper functions/classes, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
