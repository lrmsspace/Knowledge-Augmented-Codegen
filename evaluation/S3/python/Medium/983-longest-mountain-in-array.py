#
# Problem Description:
# You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:
#
#
# 	arr.length >= 3
# 	There exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
# 	
# 		arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
# 		arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
# 	
# 	
#
#
# Given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain. Return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.
#
# Example:
# Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= arr.length <= 104
# 	0 <= arr[i] <= 104
#

#
# 	Can you solve it using only one pass?
# 	Can you solve it in O(1) space?

# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It's suitable for problems requiring ordered selection from a sequence.
#   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. The standard DP approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).
#   • Invariants: At the start of iteration `i`, `dp[j]` for `j < i` stores the length of the LIS ending at `arr[j]`.; After processing `arr[i]`, `dp[i]` holds the length of the LIS ending with `arr[i]`.
#   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element is an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling strict versus non-strict increasing conditions.
# - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, dp-1d)
#   • When to use: When you need to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal ordering of non-contiguous elements.
#   • Idea: This DP approach calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in an array. It builds upon previously computed subsequence lengths, resulting in an O(N^2) time complexity.
#   • Invariants: dp[i] stores the length of the LIS ending at index i.; For any j < i, if A[j] < A[i], then dp[j] + 1 is a candidate length for dp[i].
#   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element itself forms an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
#   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling the strict increasing condition (e.g., allowing equality).
# - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
#   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It is applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered selections from a sequence.
#   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or with a greedy approach using binary search in O(N log N) time.
#   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or equivalent) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index `i`, `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1` found so far.
#   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains a 'tails' array where tails[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Use binary search (specifically `lower_bound` for strictly increasing) to find the correct position to update the 'tails' array.
#   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray; elements do not need to be contiguous.; Incorrectly applying binary search (e.g., using `upper_bound` instead of `lower_bound` for strict increase).

# - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
