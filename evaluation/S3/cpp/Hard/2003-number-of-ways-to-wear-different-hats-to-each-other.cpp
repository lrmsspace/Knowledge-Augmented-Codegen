// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-wear-different-hats-to-each-other/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There are n people and 40 types of hats labeled from 1 to 40.
//
// Given a 2D integer array hats, where hats[i] is a list of all hats preferred by the ith person.
//
// Return the number of ways that n people can wear different hats from each other.
//
// Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: hats = [[3,4],[4,5],[5]]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: There is only one way to choose hats given the conditions. 
// First person choose hat 3, Second person choose hat 4 and last one hat 5.
//
// Constraints:
// n == hats.length
// 	1 <= n <= 10
// 	1 <= hats[i].length <= 40
// 	1 <= hats[i][j] <= 40
// 	hats[i] contains a list of unique integers.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - Strongly connected components and the condensation graph (graph, array, dfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when systematically exploring all possible configurations, paths, or subsets within a graph or array. It's ideal for finding every solution or verifying properties across all potential states.
//   • Idea: Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. When combined with enumeration, it systematically generates all possible combinations or paths, typically with exponential time complexity O(V+E) for traversal or O(N!) / O(2^N) for enumeration.
//   • Invariants: The current path/subset being built is valid up to the current depth.; All previously explored branches from the current node have been fully processed.
//   • Tips: Define clear base cases for recursion termination.; Manage state changes carefully when entering and exiting recursive calls.
//   • Pitfalls: Infinite recursion due to missing or incorrect base cases.; Redundant computations if states are not properly managed or memoized.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
