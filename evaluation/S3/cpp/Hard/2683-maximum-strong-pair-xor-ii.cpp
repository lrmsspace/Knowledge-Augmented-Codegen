// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-strong-pair-xor-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A pair of integers x and y is called a strong pair if it satisfies the condition:
//
//
// 	|x - y| <= min(x, y)
//
//
// You need to select two integers from nums such that they form a strong pair and their bitwise XOR is the maximum among all strong pairs in the array.
//
// Return the maximum XOR value out of all possible strong pairs in the array nums.
//
// Note that you can pick the same integer twice to form a pair.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: There are 11 strong pairs in the array nums: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5) and (5, 5).
// The maximum XOR possible from these pairs is 3 XOR 4 = 7.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 220 - 1
//

// - Finding the nearest pair of points (geometry, array, divide-and-conquer, merge-sort, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this when finding the pair of points with the minimum Euclidean distance in a 2D plane. It efficiently handles large datasets by recursively dividing the problem and merging results.
//   • Idea: It finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane by recursively dividing the set, solving subproblems, and merging results in O(N log N) time. The merge step efficiently handles cross-boundary pairs within a narrow strip.
//   • Invariants: The minimum distance returned by a recursive call is the true minimum for its input subset.; All points in the left subproblem have x-coordinates less than or equal to the median x-coordinate.
//   • Tips: Pre-sort points by x-coordinate to enable efficient splitting.; Maintain a y-sorted list of points for efficient merging of the strip.
//   • Pitfalls: An inefficient merge step can degrade complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2).; Failing to correctly identify and process cross-boundary pairs.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use Merge Sort when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or linked lists where random access is costly.
//   • Idea: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: Each sub-array passed to merge is sorted.; The merge operation combines two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array.
//   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to maintain stability.; Consider iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: High space complexity due to auxiliary arrays.; Overhead of recursion can be significant for small inputs.
// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity sort is required, especially for large datasets or when external sorting is beneficial. It is also suitable for linked lists where random access is inefficient.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It guarantees O(N log N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: Before merging, the left subarray `a[lo...mid]` and the right subarray `a[mid+1...hi]` are sorted.; During the merge, `a[lo...k-1]` contains the `k-lo` smallest elements from `aux[lo...hi]` in sorted order.
//   • Tips: Utilize an auxiliary array for merging to maintain stability and simplify the merge logic.; Consider the bottom-up iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits and potentially improve cache performance.
//   • Pitfalls: Requires O(N) auxiliary space, which can be a significant concern for memory-constrained environments.; Recursive implementations can lead to stack overflow errors for extremely large input arrays.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
