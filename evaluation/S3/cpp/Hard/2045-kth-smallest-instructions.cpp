//
// Problem Description:
// Bob is standing at cell (0, 0), and he wants to reach destination: (row, column). He can only travel right and down. You are going to help Bob by providing instructions for him to reach destination.
//
// The instructions are represented as a string, where each character is either:
//
//
// 	'H', meaning move horizontally (go right), or
// 	'V', meaning move vertically (go down).
//
//
// Multiple instructions will lead Bob to destination. For example, if destination is (2, 3), both "HHHVV" and "HVHVH" are valid instructions.
//
// However, Bob is very picky. Bob has a lucky number k, and he wants the kth lexicographically smallest instructions that will lead him to destination. k is 1-indexed.
//
// Given an integer array destination and an integer k, return the kth lexicographically smallest instructions that will take Bob to destination.
//
// Example:
// Input: destination = [2,3], k = 1
// Output: "HHHVV"
// Explanation: All the instructions that reach (2, 3) in lexicographic order are as follows:
// ["HHHVV", "HHVHV", "HHVVH", "HVHHV", "HVHVH", "HVVHH", "VHHHV", "VHHVH", "VHVHH", "VVHHH"].
//
// Constraints:
// destination.length == 2
// 	1 <= row, column <= 15
// 	1 <= k <= nCr(row + column, row), where nCr(a, b) denotes a choose b​​​​​.

// - Binomial Coefficients (array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to compute many binomial coefficients, especially for values up to a certain N, or when working with modulo arithmetic where division is not straightforward.
//   • Idea: This method computes binomial coefficients using Pascal's identity, building a 2D DP table where C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k). It has a time complexity of O(N^2) for computing all coefficients up to N.
//   • Invariants: For each cell dp[i][j], it stores the value of C(i, j).; At the start of computing row i, all values for row i-1 are correctly calculated and available.
//   • Tips: Optimize space by storing only the current and previous row of the DP table.; For O(1) lookup after precomputation, calculate all factorials and inverse factorials modulo a prime.
//   • Pitfalls: Direct division for C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) is problematic with modulo arithmetic unless the modulo is prime.; Integer overflow can occur for large N and K if not handled with appropriate data types or modulo operations.
// - Binomial Coefficients (number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to calculate multiple binomial coefficients or when a single coefficient is required and N and K are not excessively large, allowing for table precomputation.
//   • Idea: This method computes binomial coefficients C(n, k) using Pascal's recurrence relation C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k), typically building a table. It has a time complexity of O(N*K) or O(N^2) for building the full triangle up to N.
//   • Invariants: C[i][0] is always 1 for any row i.; C[i][i] is always 1 for any row i.
//   • Tips: Intermediate results for Pascal's Triangle never exceed the final answer, simplifying overflow checks if not using modular arithmetic.; Each new table element requires only one addition, making it computationally efficient per element.
//   • Pitfalls: Building the entire Pascal's Triangle for a single C(N, K) can be slow for large N and K, as it computes many unnecessary values.; Directly computing C(N, K) using factorials can lead to overflow issues for large N, even if the final result fits.
// - Binomial Coefficients (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to calculate the number of ways to choose k items from n distinct items, often under modular constraints.
//   • Idea: Binomial coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n distinct items. They can be computed using Pascal's identity or factorials, with complexity varying based on the method and modulo requirements.
//   • Invariants: For Pascal's triangle, dp[i][j] stores C(i, j).; For factorial method, fact[i] stores i! % M.
//   • Tips: Use Pascal's triangle for small n and k values.; Precompute factorials and inverse factorials for larger n modulo a prime.
//   • Pitfalls: Overflow with large factorials if not using modular arithmetic.; Division by zero when computing inverse modulo if modulus is not prime.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
