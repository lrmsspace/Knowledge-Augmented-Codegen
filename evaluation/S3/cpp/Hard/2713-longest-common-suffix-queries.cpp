// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-suffix-queries/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two arrays of strings wordsContainer and wordsQuery.
//
// For each wordsQuery[i], you need to find a string from wordsContainer that has the longest common suffix with wordsQuery[i]. If there are two or more strings in wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix, find the string that is the smallest in length. If there are two or more such strings that have the same smallest length, find the one that occurred earlier in wordsContainer.
//
// Return an array of integers ans, where ans[i] is the index of the string in wordsContainer that has the longest common suffix with wordsQuery[i].
//
// Example:
// Input: wordsContainer = ["abcd","bcd","xbcd"], wordsQuery = ["cd","bcd","xyz"]
//
// Output: [1,1,1]
//
// Explanation:
//
// Let's look at each wordsQuery[i] separately:
//
//
// 	For wordsQuery[0] = "cd", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "cd" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
// 	For wordsQuery[1] = "bcd", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "bcd" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
// 	For wordsQuery[2] = "xyz", there is no string from wordsContainer that shares a common suffix. Hence the longest common suffix is "", that is shared with strings at index 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= wordsContainer.length, wordsQuery.length <= 104
// 	1 <= wordsContainer[i].length <= 5 * 103
// 	1 <= wordsQuery[i].length <= 5 * 103
// 	wordsContainer[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
// 	wordsQuery[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
// 	Sum of wordsContainer[i].length is at most 5 * 105.
// 	Sum of wordsQuery[i].length is at most 5 * 105.

// - Suffix Automaton (string, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently represent all substrings of a given string and perform various string operations like counting distinct substrings or pattern matching in linear time.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal finite automaton that accepts all suffixes of a given string. It implicitly represents all substrings and can be constructed in linear time, O(N) where N is the string length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the initial state spells a substring of the original string.; Each state represents a set of substrings that share the same end positions in the original string.
//   • Tips: Understand the concept of `endpos` sets and how they define states.; The number of states and transitions in a suffix automaton is linear with respect to string length.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm can be complex and prone to off-by-one errors or incorrect link updates.; Debugging state transitions and suffix links requires careful attention.
// - Suffix array (array, tree, string, suffix-array, tree-dp, lca)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to perform fast substring searches, pattern matching, or other string operations on a fixed text, especially when space efficiency is critical compared to suffix trees.
//   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing only their starting indices. It is often paired with an LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array to enable efficient string algorithms, typically achieving O(N log N) or O(N) construction and O(M + log N) or O(M) search complexity.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `A` stores indices such that `S[A[i]:]` is lexicographically smaller than `S[A[i+1]:]` for all valid `i`.; The `lcp[i]` value represents the length of the longest common prefix between `S[A[i-1]:]` and `S[A[i]:]`.
//   • Tips: Pair with an LCP array to significantly speed up pattern searching and other string queries.; Consider Enhanced Suffix Arrays (ESA) for improved space and time efficiency over suffix trees, especially for large datasets.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive pattern searching without LCP information can be O(M log N), which might be too slow for long patterns.; Construction can be complex to implement efficiently in linear time.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently represent all distinct substrings of a string, or perform various string operations like counting unique substrings, finding occurrences, or string matching in an online fashion.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a powerful data structure that represents all distinct substrings of a given string in a compact form, typically as a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG). It can be constructed in linear time O(N) and space O(N) for a string of length N.
//   • Invariants: Each state in the automaton represents a set of substrings that share the same end-positions in the original string.; For any state `v`, `len(v)` is the length of the longest string represented by `v`.
//   • Tips: Understand the properties of `len` (length of the longest string in a state) and `link` (suffix link to the longest proper suffix).; The construction is online, processing characters one by one from left to right.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `link` updates, especially when cloning states during construction.; Forgetting to update the `last` pointer after each character addition step.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
