// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-array-divisible/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two positive integer arrays nums and numsDivide. You can delete any number of elements from nums.
//
// Return the minimum number of deletions such that the smallest element in nums divides all the elements of numsDivide. If this is not possible, return -1.
//
// Note that an integer x divides y if y % x == 0.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,3,2,4,3], numsDivide = [9,6,9,3,15]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 
// The smallest element in [2,3,2,4,3] is 2, which does not divide all the elements of numsDivide.
// We use 2 deletions to delete the elements in nums that are equal to 2 which makes nums = [3,4,3].
// The smallest element in [3,4,3] is 3, which divides all the elements of numsDivide.
// It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of deletions needed.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length, numsDivide.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i], numsDivide[i] <= 109

// - Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (number, gcd)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the greatest common divisor of two or more integers, or as a subroutine for tasks like simplifying fractions or finding the least common multiple.
//   • Idea: The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log min(a, b)).
//   • Invariants: The greatest common divisor of the current pair (a, b) remains constant and equal to the GCD of the original inputs.; The second number (b) is always non-negative.
//   • Tips: Handle the base case where one of the numbers is zero; gcd(a, 0) = a.; The algorithm works for any order of inputs; if a < b, the first step swaps them effectively.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to take absolute values if negative inputs are possible, as GCD is typically defined for non-negative integers.; Incorrectly handling the zero input case, which can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.

//   • Idea: The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. It has a logarithmic time complexity, typically O(log(min(a,b))).
//   • Invariants: The GCD of the current pair (a, b) is always equal to the GCD of the original input numbers.; If a and b are non-negative, then the current values of a and b remain non-negative.
//   • Tips: The GCD of any number and zero is the number itself (e.g., gcd(a, 0) = a).; To calculate LCM, use the formula lcm(a, b) = (a / gcd(a, b)) * b to prevent potential overflow.
//   • Pitfalls: Ensure inputs are non-negative; if negative, take absolute values first.; Be careful with `gcd(0, 0)` definition, which is often undefined or 0.
// - Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (number, gcd, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find the greatest common divisor of two or more non-negative integers. It efficiently determines the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder.
//   • Idea: The Euclidean algorithm efficiently computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers by repeatedly applying the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b). Its time complexity is logarithmic with respect to the smaller of the two numbers, specifically O(log(min(a, b))).
//   • Invariants: The greatest common divisor of the two numbers remains constant throughout the algorithm.; Both numbers involved in the computation are always non-negative.
//   • Tips: Prefer the modulo-based version for significantly better performance than repeated subtraction.; Handle the base case where one number is zero; the GCD is the other non-zero number.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining gcd(0, 0); it's often conveniently set to 0 to maintain associativity.; Using repeated subtraction for large numbers, which is much slower than the modulo operation.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
