//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n denoting the number of nodes of a weighted directed graph. The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1.
//
// You are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] denotes that there exists a directed edge from fromi to toi with weight weighti.
//
// Lastly, you are given three distinct integers src1, src2, and dest denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.
//
// Return the minimum weight of a subgraph of the graph such that it is possible to reach dest from both src1 and src2 via a set of edges of this subgraph. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return -1.
//
// A subgraph is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The weight of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5
// Output: 9
// Explanation:
// The above figure represents the input graph.
// The blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.
// Note that the subgraph [[1,0,3],[0,5,6]] also yields the optimal answer. It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= edges.length <= 105
// 	edges[i].length == 3
// 	0 <= fromi, toi, src1, src2, dest <= n - 1
// 	fromi != toi
// 	src1, src2, and dest are pairwise distinct.
// 	1 <= weight[i] <= 105
//

// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
// - Strongly connected components and the condensation graph (graph, array, dfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when systematically exploring all possible configurations, paths, or subsets within a graph or array. It's ideal for finding every solution or verifying properties across all potential states.
//   • Idea: Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. When combined with enumeration, it systematically generates all possible combinations or paths, typically with exponential time complexity O(V+E) for traversal or O(N!) / O(2^N) for enumeration.
//   • Invariants: The current path/subset being built is valid up to the current depth.; All previously explored branches from the current node have been fully processed.
//   • Tips: Define clear base cases for recursion termination.; Manage state changes carefully when entering and exiting recursive calls.
//   • Pitfalls: Infinite recursion due to missing or incorrect base cases.; Redundant computations if states are not properly managed or memoized.
// - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the shortest paths between all possible pairs of vertices in a graph. It is particularly suitable for dense graphs or when negative edge weights are present, as long as no negative cycles are reachable.
//   • Idea: Floyd-Warshall is a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It iteratively considers all possible intermediate vertices to update path distances, achieving an O(V^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After the k-th iteration, dist[i][j] contains the shortest path from i to j considering only vertices 0 to k-1 as intermediate nodes.; For any pair (i, j), dist[i][j] is always greater than or equal to the true shortest path distance from i to j (or infinity if unreachable).
//   • Tips: Initialize distances: direct edge weights, infinity for no direct edge, zero for self-loops.; The outermost loop must iterate through intermediate vertices (k).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect loop order (k not outermost) leads to incorrect results.; Integer overflow with large path sums if not using appropriate data types.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
