// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-valid-paths-in-a-tree/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi in the tree.
//
// Return the number of valid paths in the tree.
//
// A path (a, b) is valid if there exists exactly one prime number among the node labels in the path from a to b.
//
// Note that:
//
//
// 	The path (a, b) is a sequence of distinct nodes starting with node a and ending with node b such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.
// 	Path (a, b) and path (b, a) are considered the same and counted only once.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The pairs with exactly one prime number on the path between them are: 
// - (1, 2) since the path from 1 to 2 contains prime number 2. 
// - (1, 3) since the path from 1 to 3 contains prime number 3.
// - (1, 4) since the path from 1 to 4 contains prime number 2.
// - (2, 4) since the path from 2 to 4 contains prime number 2.
// It can be shown that there are only 4 valid paths.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= ui, vi <= n
// 	The input is generated such that edges represent a valid tree.

// - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit or precompute primality for a range. It is efficient for generating primes within a reasonable upper bound.
//   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer by iteratively marking multiples of primes as composite. It achieves a time complexity of O(N log log N).
//   • Invariants: All numbers less than the current prime 'p' have already been processed.; If 'i' is marked as prime, then all its multiples less than 'i*i' have been marked composite by smaller primes.
//   • Tips: Optimize by starting inner loop from p*p, as smaller multiples would have been marked.; Use a boolean array for primality, or an integer array to store smallest prime factor (SPF).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0 and 1, which are neither prime nor composite.; Off-by-one errors when setting array bounds or loop conditions.
// - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, bitset, sieve)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit N efficiently. It is ideal for problems requiring primality tests or prime factorizations for multiple numbers within a fixed range.
//   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer N. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number as composite, achieving a time complexity of O(N log log N).
//   • Invariants: For any number `p` processed, all its multiples less than `p*p` are already marked composite.; At the start of an iteration for `i`, if `is_prime[i]` is true, then `i` is a prime number.
//   • Tips: Initialize a boolean array `is_prime` to true for all numbers.; Start marking multiples from `p*p` for each prime `p` to optimize.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle 0 and 1 correctly (they are not prime).; Integer overflow when calculating `i*i` for large `i`.
// - Linear Sieve (array, sieve)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a given limit N, or compute the least prime factor for all numbers in that range, efficiently in linear time.
//   • Idea: The Linear Sieve finds all prime numbers up to N in O(N) time by ensuring each composite number is marked exactly once by its least prime factor. It also computes the least prime factor for every number up to N.
//   • Invariants: The 'primes' list always contains all prime numbers found so far in increasing order.; lpf[i] stores the least prime factor of 'i' if 'i' is composite, or 'i' itself if 'i' is prime.
//   • Tips: Store the least prime factor (LPF) for each number in an array.; Maintain a dynamically growing list of primes found so far.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly marking multiples can lead to O(N log log N) or worse complexity.; Forgetting to store the least prime factor can break the linear time guarantee.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
