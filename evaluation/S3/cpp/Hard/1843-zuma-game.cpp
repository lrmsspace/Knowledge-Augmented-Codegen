// Problem Description:
// You are playing a variation of the game Zuma.
//
// In this variation of Zuma, there is a single row of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red 'R', yellow 'Y', blue 'B', green 'G', or white 'W'. You also have several colored balls in your hand.
//
// Your goal is to clear all of the balls from the board. On each turn:
//
//
// 	Pick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.
// 	If there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board.
// 	
// 		If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.
// 	
// 	
// 	If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.
// 	Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.
//
//
// Given a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board. If you cannot clear all the balls from the board using the balls in your hand, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: board = "WRRBBW", hand = "RB"
// Output: -1
// Explanation: It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is:
// - Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRRRBBW. WRRRBBW -> WBBW.
// - Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBBBW. WBBBW -> WW.
// There are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= board.length <= 16
// 	1 <= hand.length <= 5
// 	board and hand consist of the characters 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', and 'W'.
// 	The initial row of balls on the board will not have any groups of three or more consecutive balls of the same color.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
//   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
//   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: When needing to efficiently represent all substrings of a given string and perform various string operations like counting distinct substrings, finding occurrences, or checking for specific patterns. It provides a compact and powerful data structure for complex string problems.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal deterministic finite automaton that recognizes all suffixes of a given string. It compactly represents all substrings of the string, with each state corresponding to an endpos-equivalence class, and can be constructed in linear time O(N).
//   • Invariants: Every state corresponds to a unique endpos-equivalence class of substrings.; For any state, all substrings ending at its endpos set are represented by that state or its ancestors via suffix links.
//   • Tips: Focus on the endpos definition for state equivalence.; Understand the incremental construction process.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm is non-trivial and prone to off-by-one errors.; Misinterpreting the role of suffix links vs. transition links.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    int findMinStep(string board, string hand) {
        // This problem can be solved using a backtracking approach, where we try all possible insertions of balls from the hand into the board and check if we can clear the board. We can use a helper function to perform the backtracking and another helper function to remove consecutive balls from the board.
