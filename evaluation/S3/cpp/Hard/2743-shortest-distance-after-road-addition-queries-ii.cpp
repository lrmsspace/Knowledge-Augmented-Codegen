// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-after-road-addition-queries-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array queries.
//
// There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. Initially, there is a unidirectional road from city i to city i + 1 for all 0 <= i < n - 1.
//
// queries[i] = [ui, vi] represents the addition of a new unidirectional road from city ui to city vi. After each query, you need to find the length of the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1.
//
// There are no two queries such that queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] < queries[i][1] < queries[j][1].
//
// Return an array answer where for each i in the range [0, queries.length - 1], answer[i] is the length of the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1 after processing the first i + 1 queries.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5, queries = [[2,4],[0,2],[0,4]]
//
// Output: [3,2,1]
//
// Explanation: 
//
//
//
// After the addition of the road from 2 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 3.
//
//
//
// After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 2.
//
//
//
// After the addition of the road from 0 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	queries[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= queries[i][0] < queries[i][1] < n
// 	1 < queries[i][1] - queries[i][0]
// 	There are no repeated roads among the queries.
// 	There are no two queries such that i != j and queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] < queries[i][1] < queries[j][1].

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Segment Tree (tree, array, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to perform range queries (like sum, min, max) and point or range updates on an array efficiently, typically in logarithmic time.
//   • Idea: A Segment Tree is a tree-based data structure that stores information about array intervals, enabling efficient O(log n) range queries and point/range updates.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree represents a contiguous subsegment of the original array.; The value stored in a non-leaf node is an aggregation of the values from its direct children.
//   • Tips: Build the tree recursively, dividing the array into halves.; Use lazy propagation for efficient range updates to avoid O(N) updates.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when defining segment boundaries or array indices.; Forgetting to push down lazy tags before querying or updating children nodes.
// - Segment Tree (tree, array, segment-tree, divide-and-conquer)
//   • When to use: When you need to perform range queries (like sum, min, max) and point or range updates on an array efficiently, typically in O(log N) time.
//   • Idea: A tree-based data structure that stores information about array segments, allowing for efficient O(log N) range queries and point/range updates. It recursively divides the array into halves, with each node representing an interval.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree corresponds to a contiguous subsegment of the original array.; The value stored in a node is the aggregate result (e.g., sum, min) of its corresponding array subsegment.
//   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for array and tree nodes to simplify parent/child calculations.; Implement lazy propagation for efficient range updates to avoid O(N) updates.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in segment boundaries or query ranges are common.; Forgetting to push down lazy updates before accessing children or returning a node's value.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
