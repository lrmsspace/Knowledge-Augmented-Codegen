// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/strange-printer/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:
//
//
// 	The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
// 	At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will cover the original existing characters.
//
//
// Given a string s, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "aaabbb"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 100
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters.

// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries, especially Range Minimum/Maximum Queries, on an immutable array very quickly. It is ideal for scenarios where the data does not change and query performance is critical.
//   • Idea: Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes answers for all range queries of power-of-two lengths. It allows O(1) query time for idempotent operations like Range Minimum/Maximum Queries on a static array, with O(N log N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: st[k][i] holds the result for the segment starting at index i with length 2^k.; For any k > 0, st[k][i] combines the results of two adjacent segments of length 2^(k-1).
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values to find the largest power of two in O(1).; Best suited for idempotent operations like minimum, maximum, or GCD.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support array updates; any modification invalidates the structure.; Inefficient for non-idempotent operations like range sum or XOR in O(1).
// - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences of a pattern in a text, analyzing string periodicity, or counting distinct substrings. It is especially useful for processing extremely long or recursively defined strings where explicit construction is impossible.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm leverages a precomputed prefix function (LPS array) to avoid redundant comparisons during string searching, achieving linear time complexity. The prefix function itself determines the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix, enabling various string property analyses in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: For any index `i`, `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i]`.; During prefix function computation, `j` always represents the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i-1]` that is also a suffix.
//   • Tips: The prefix function `pi[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix.; Concatenate pattern, a unique separator, and text (`P + # + T`) to find all pattern occurrences.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors with array indexing or the precise definition of the prefix function.; Incorrectly handling the unique separator character in concatenated strings, leading to false matches.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
