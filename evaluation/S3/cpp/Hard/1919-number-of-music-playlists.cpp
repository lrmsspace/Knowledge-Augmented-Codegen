// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-music-playlists/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Your music player contains n different songs. You want to listen to goal songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:
//
//
// 	Every song is played at least once.
// 	A song can only be played again only if k other songs have been played.
//
//
// Given n, goal, and k, return the number of possible playlists that you can create. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, goal = 3, k = 1
// Output: 6
// Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= k < n <= goal <= 100
//

// - Binomial Coefficients (array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to compute many binomial coefficients, especially for values up to a certain N, or when working with modulo arithmetic where division is not straightforward.
//   • Idea: This method computes binomial coefficients using Pascal's identity, building a 2D DP table where C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k). It has a time complexity of O(N^2) for computing all coefficients up to N.
//   • Invariants: For each cell dp[i][j], it stores the value of C(i, j).; At the start of computing row i, all values for row i-1 are correctly calculated and available.
//   • Tips: Optimize space by storing only the current and previous row of the DP table.; For O(1) lookup after precomputation, calculate all factorials and inverse factorials modulo a prime.
//   • Pitfalls: Direct division for C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) is problematic with modulo arithmetic unless the modulo is prime.; Integer overflow can occur for large N and K if not handled with appropriate data types or modulo operations.
// - Binomial Coefficients (array, number, dp-1d, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating binomial coefficients C(n, k) modulo a composite number M, especially when M is not prime and direct modular inverse computation for factorials is not possible.
//   • Idea: This technique computes binomial coefficients modulo an arbitrary composite number M by factoring M into prime powers. For each prime power, it calculates prime exponents in factorials and combines coprime parts, then uses Chinese Remainder Theorem.
//   • Invariants: For any `i <= N`, `c[i]` correctly stores the exponent of prime `p` in `i!`.; For any `i <= N`, `g[i]` correctly stores `(i! / p^c[i]) % (p^b)`.
//   • Tips: Precompute factorials and their prime exponents up to N using dynamic programming.; Apply Legendre's formula to efficiently find the exponent of a prime 'p' in 'x!'.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly factorize the modulus 'M' into its prime power components.; Incorrectly computing modular inverses when a number is not coprime to the modulus.
// - Binomial Coefficients (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to calculate the number of ways to choose k items from n distinct items, often under modular constraints.
//   • Idea: Binomial coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n distinct items. They can be computed using Pascal's identity or factorials, with complexity varying based on the method and modulo requirements.
//   • Invariants: For Pascal's triangle, dp[i][j] stores C(i, j).; For factorial method, fact[i] stores i! % M.
//   • Tips: Use Pascal's triangle for small n and k values.; Precompute factorials and inverse factorials for larger n modulo a prime.
//   • Pitfalls: Overflow with large factorials if not using modular arithmetic.; Division by zero when computing inverse modulo if modulus is not prime.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
