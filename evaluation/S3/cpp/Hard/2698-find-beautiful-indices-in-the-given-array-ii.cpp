// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-beautiful-indices-in-the-given-array-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed string s, a string a, a string b, and an integer k.
//
// An index i is beautiful if:
//
//
// 	0 <= i <= s.length - a.length
// 	s[i..(i + a.length - 1)] == a
// 	There exists an index j such that:
// 	
// 		0 <= j <= s.length - b.length
// 		s[j..(j + b.length - 1)] == b
// 		|j - i| <= k
// 	
// 	
//
//
// Return the array that contains beautiful indices in sorted order from smallest to largest.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "isawsquirrelnearmysquirrelhouseohmy", a = "my", b = "squirrel", k = 15
// Output: [16,33]
// Explanation: There are 2 beautiful indices: [16,33].
// - The index 16 is beautiful as s[16..17] == "my" and there exists an index 4 with s[4..11] == "squirrel" and |16 - 4| <= 15.
// - The index 33 is beautiful as s[33..34] == "my" and there exists an index 18 with s[18..25] == "squirrel" and |33 - 18| <= 15.
// Thus we return [16,33] as the result.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 105
// 	1 <= a.length, b.length <= 5 * 105
// 	s, a, and b contain only lowercase English letters.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Substring Search (string, array, kmp, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern within a larger text, especially when the pattern might have repeating or overlapping prefixes.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that avoids re-scanning characters in the text by pre-processing the pattern to build a 'longest proper prefix suffix' (LPS) array. It achieves optimal O(N + M) time complexity, where N is the text length and M is the pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `j` pointer always indicates the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `text[0...i-1]`.; The `lps[j]` value stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...j-1]`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the LPS array (also known as failure function or border array) for the pattern.; The LPS array helps determine the next best match position after a mismatch, avoiding redundant comparisons.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the LPS array can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors when indexing the pattern or text are common.
// - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
// - Prefix function. Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (string, array, kmp, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When efficiently searching for all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text string, or when computing the longest proper prefix of a string that is also a suffix for all its prefixes.
//   • Idea: The KMP algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern within a text by pre-processing the pattern to build a prefix function (LPS array), which avoids redundant character comparisons. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M) for text length N and pattern length M.
//   • Invariants: The prefix function array `pi` stores for each `i` the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i]`.; During prefix function computation for `pi[i]`, `j` always represents the length of the longest proper prefix of `s[0...i-1]` that is also a suffix of `s[0...i-1]`.
//   • Tips: Precompute the prefix function (LPS array) for the pattern to guide shifts.; Use two pointers: one for the text (or current character in pattern for prefix function), one for the pattern (or length of matched prefix).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating or using the prefix function values, leading to wrong shifts.; Off-by-one errors when indexing or shifting pointers, especially at boundaries.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
