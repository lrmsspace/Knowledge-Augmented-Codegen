// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/split-the-array-to-make-coprime-products/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.
//
// A split at an index i where 0 <= i <= n - 2 is called valid if the product of the first i + 1 elements and the product of the remaining elements are coprime.
//
//
// 	For example, if nums = [2, 3, 3], then a split at the index i = 0 is valid because 2 and 9 are coprime, while a split at the index i = 1 is not valid because 6 and 3 are not coprime. A split at the index i = 2 is not valid because i == n - 1.
//
//
// Return the smallest index i at which the array can be split validly or -1 if there is no such split.
//
// Two values val1 and val2 are coprime if gcd(val1, val2) == 1 where gcd(val1, val2) is the greatest common divisor of val1 and val2.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [4,7,8,15,3,5]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The table above shows the values of the product of the first i + 1 elements, the remaining elements, and their gcd at each index i.
// The only valid split is at index 2.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	1 <= n <= 104
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 106

// - Euler's totient function
//  (array, number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. It is also efficient for computing totient values for all numbers in a given range.
//   • Idea: Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. It can be computed for a single n in O(sqrt(n)) using prime factorization, or for all numbers up to N in O(N log log N) using a sieve-like algorithm.
//   • Invariants: phi[i] stores the current totient value for i, which is i initially, then updated by (1 - 1/p) for each prime p dividing i.; After iterating through all primes p up to sqrt(N), phi[i] holds the correct totient value for all i <= N.
//   • Tips: For a single n, compute φ(n) using its prime factorization.; For all φ(i) up to N, use a sieve approach similar to Sieve of Eratosthenes.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 'relatively prime' with 'prime number'.; Applying the multiplicative property incorrectly when numbers share common factors.
// - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit or precompute primality for a range. It is efficient for generating primes within a reasonable upper bound.
//   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer by iteratively marking multiples of primes as composite. It achieves a time complexity of O(N log log N).
//   • Invariants: All numbers less than the current prime 'p' have already been processed.; If 'i' is marked as prime, then all its multiples less than 'i*i' have been marked composite by smaller primes.
//   • Tips: Optimize by starting inner loop from p*p, as smaller multiples would have been marked.; Use a boolean array for primality, or an integer array to store smallest prime factor (SPF).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0 and 1, which are neither prime nor composite.; Off-by-one errors when setting array bounds or loop conditions.
// - Euler's totient function
//  (array, number, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. It is also useful for problems involving modular arithmetic, group theory, and cryptographic applications.
//   • Idea: Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. It can be computed using prime factorization in O(sqrt(N)) or for a range using a sieve in O(N log log N).
//   • Invariants: For a sieve, phi[i] correctly stores the totient value for i after processing all its prime factors.; When factorizing n, n is continuously reduced by its smallest prime factor until it becomes 1.
//   • Tips: For a single n, find its prime factors and apply the product formula.; For computing φ(n) for all n up to a limit, use a sieve similar to Sieve of Eratosthenes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling repeated prime factors in the formula.; Integer overflow when calculating products for very large n.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
