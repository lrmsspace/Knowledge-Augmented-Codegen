// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/non-negative-integers-without-consecutive-ones/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a positive integer n, return the number of the integers in the range [0, n] whose binary representations do not contain consecutive ones.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5
// Output: 5
// Explanation:
// Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
// 0 : 0
// 1 : 1
// 2 : 10
// 3 : 11
// 4 : 100
// 5 : 101
// Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 109
//

// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: When counting numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based properties, or calculating a sum of such properties.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique used to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers within a given range, based on their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, processing digits from most significant to least significant, achieving a time complexity of O(log(N) * S * T) where S is sum/state range and T is tight constraint.
//   • Invariants: The `idx` parameter always represents the current digit position being processed, from most significant to least significant.; The `tight` boolean parameter accurately indicates if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's corresponding digit.
//   • Tips: Handle leading zeros carefully, often with a dedicated boolean state in the DP function.; Use a 'tight' or 'limit' boolean parameter to manage the upper bound constraint imposed by the original number.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint can lead to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to reset the memoization table for each new query or test case, especially in competitive programming.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
