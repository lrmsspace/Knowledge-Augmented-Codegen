//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.
//
// In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:
//
// Example:
// Input: rowIndex = 3
// Output: [1,3,3,1]
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= rowIndex <= 33
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra space?
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Binomial Coefficients (array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to compute many binomial coefficients, especially for values up to a certain N, or when working with modulo arithmetic where division is not straightforward.
//   • Idea: This method computes binomial coefficients using Pascal's identity, building a 2D DP table where C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k). It has a time complexity of O(N^2) for computing all coefficients up to N.
//   • Invariants: For each cell dp[i][j], it stores the value of C(i, j).; At the start of computing row i, all values for row i-1 are correctly calculated and available.
//   • Tips: Optimize space by storing only the current and previous row of the DP table.; For O(1) lookup after precomputation, calculate all factorials and inverse factorials modulo a prime.
//   • Pitfalls: Direct division for C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) is problematic with modulo arithmetic unless the modulo is prime.; Integer overflow can occur for large N and K if not handled with appropriate data types or modulo operations.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Fibonacci Numbers (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use this when calculating the n-th Fibonacci number or similar sequences where each term depends on a fixed number of preceding terms. It efficiently avoids redundant computations for moderate 'n' values.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates Fibonacci numbers iteratively by storing previously computed values in an array, building up to the desired n-th term. This approach achieves O(N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] correctly stores the i-th Fibonacci number.; For i >= 2, dp[i] is computed as the sum of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2].
//   • Tips: Initialize base cases (F0, F1) correctly to start the sequence.; Use an array or two variables to store only the necessary previous terms.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly initializing the base cases can lead to wrong results.; A naive recursive solution without memoization will lead to exponential time complexity.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
