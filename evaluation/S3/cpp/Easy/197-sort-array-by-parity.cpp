//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.
//
// Return any array that satisfies this condition.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
// Output: [2,4,3,1]
// Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 5000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Quicksort (array, two-pointers, randomized)
//   • When to use: Use Quicksort for efficient in-place sorting of arrays, especially when average-case performance and cache efficiency are prioritized. It is suitable for large datasets where memory usage is a concern.
//   • Idea: Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot element, then recursively sorts the two resulting subarrays. Its average time complexity is O(N log N), but can degrade to O(N^2) in the worst case.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the `lt` pointer are less than the pivot value.; All elements to the right of the `gt` pointer are greater than the pivot value.
//   • Tips: Randomly shuffle the input or choose a random pivot to ensure average-case performance.; Employ 3-way partitioning to efficiently handle duplicate keys and avoid quadratic worst-case scenarios.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to handle duplicate keys can lead to quadratic time complexity.; Incorrect pointer crossing logic can cause infinite loops or array out-of-bounds errors.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, ds, sliding-window, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when performing frequent range queries and point updates on an array, especially when a segment tree is too complex or memory-intensive, or when query types are diverse. It offers a balanced time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and point updates. It achieves O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations.
//   • Invariants: Each element `arr[i]` belongs to exactly one block `block[i / block_size]`.; The summary for each block `block_summary[j]` accurately reflects the state of elements within block `j`.
//   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for balanced performance.; Precompute block summaries (e.g., sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or boundaries.; Forgetting to update the block's summary after a point update.

// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
