// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cuts-to-divide-a-circle/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// A valid cut in a circle can be:
//
//
// 	A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center, or
// 	A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.
//
//
// Some valid and invalid cuts are shown in the figures below.
//
// Given the integer n, return the minimum number of cuts needed to divide a circle into n equal slices.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 
// The above figure shows how cutting the circle twice through the middle divides it into 4 equal slices.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 100

// - Josephus Problem (number, recursion, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when simulating a circular elimination process with a fixed step size, especially when seeking the survivor's position. It's particularly efficient for specific step sizes like two.
//   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the last remaining position in a circular arrangement after elements are eliminated at fixed intervals. The recursive solution for a step size of two has a logarithmic time complexity, O(log N), due to its divide-and-conquer nature.
//   • Invariants: The number of participants N is always positive in each recursive subproblem.; The returned position is always within the valid range [0, current N-1] (or [1, current N]).
//   • Tips: Base cases are crucial for recursive solutions, typically for N=1.; Observe patterns for specific step sizes, especially k=2, which has a simpler formula.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when converting between 0-indexed and 1-indexed results.; Incorrectly applying the position 'shift' after elements are eliminated in subproblems.
// - Primality tests (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to determine if a single number is prime, especially for numbers where trial division up to its square root is computationally feasible.
//   • Idea: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This method checks for primality by attempting to find a non-trivial divisor up to the square root of the given number, running in O(sqrt(N)) time.
//   • Invariants: No integer k in the range [2, current_divisor - 1] has been found to divide n.; The current value current_divisor is a candidate divisor being tested against n.
//   • Tips: Only check numbers between 2 and sqrt(n).; Handle 2 as a special case before iterating.
//   • Pitfalls: O(sqrt(N)) complexity can be too slow for very large numbers.; Incorrectly handling edge cases like 0, 1, or 2.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
