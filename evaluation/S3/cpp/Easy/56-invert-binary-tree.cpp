//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
// Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
// 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to store ordered data that allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion while maintaining sorted order. It's suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(log N) average time and O(N) worst-case.
//   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than its key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than its key.
//   • Tips: Maintain the BST property: left child < parent < right child.; Recursion simplifies many operations like search, insert, and traversal.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade performance to O(N) for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can break BST properties or lead to data loss.
// - Depth First Search (graph, dfs, topo)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable vertices from a starting point, find paths, detect cycles, or perform topological sorting on directed acyclic graphs.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically runs in O(V + E) time for graphs represented with adjacency lists, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: Every node is visited at most once.; The `visited` set accurately reflects nodes currently in the recursion stack or fully explored.
//   • Tips: Always use a visited set to avoid infinite loops in cyclic graphs.; For topological sort, add nodes to a list after visiting all their neighbors.
//   • Pitfalls: Risk of stack overflow for very deep graphs or trees.; Failing to mark nodes as visited before recursive calls can lead to re-processing.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
