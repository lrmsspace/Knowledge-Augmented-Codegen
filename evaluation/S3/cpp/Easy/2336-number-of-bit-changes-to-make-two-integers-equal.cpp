//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two positive integers n and k.
//
// You can choose any bit in the binary representation of n that is equal to 1 and change it to 0.
//
// Return the number of changes needed to make n equal to k. If it is impossible, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 13, k = 4
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
// Initially, the binary representations of n and k are n = (1101)2 and k = (0100)2.
// We can change the first and fourth bits of n. The resulting integer is n = (0100)2 = k.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n, k <= 106
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Bit manipulation (number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use for efficient low-level operations on integers, checking properties related to powers of two, or manipulating individual bits. It provides constant-time solutions for many numerical checks.
//   • Idea: This card covers fundamental bitwise operations for checking number properties like divisibility by powers of two, identifying powers of two, and manipulating individual bits. These operations typically run in O(1) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For a positive integer `n`, `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` if and only if `n` is a power of two.; An integer `n` is divisible by `2^k` if and only if its `k` least significant bits are all zero, which is checked by `(n & ((1 << k) - 1)) == 0`.
//   • Tips: Use `n & 1` to efficiently check if a number `n` is odd or even.; The expression `1 << k` calculates 2 raised to the power of `k`.
//   • Pitfalls: When checking if a number is a power of two, remember to handle the `n == 0` case separately as `0 & (-1)` is `0`.; Be cautious with integer overflow when performing left shifts (`1 << k`) for large `k` values.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
