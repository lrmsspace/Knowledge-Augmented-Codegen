// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-elements-into-two-arrays-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 1-indexed array of distinct integers nums of length n.
//
// You need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays arr1 and arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1. In the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith operation:
//
//
// 	If the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2, append nums[i] to arr1. Otherwise, append nums[i] to arr2.
//
//
// The array result is formed by concatenating the arrays arr1 and arr2. For example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6], then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6].
//
// Return the array result.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,1,3]
// Output: [2,3,1]
// Explanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [2] and arr2 = [1].
// In the 3rd operation, as the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2 (2 > 1), append nums[3] to arr1.
// After 3 operations, arr1 = [2,3] and arr2 = [1].
// Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [2,3,1].
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= n <= 50
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 100
// 	All elements in nums are distinct.

// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, number, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the optimal sequence of jobs to minimize the total completion time (makespan) on two machines, with a fixed processing order (machine 1 then machine 2) for all jobs.
//   • Idea: This problem involves ordering N jobs, each with two processing times (one for each machine), to minimize the overall makespan. Johnson's rule provides an optimal greedy solution for this specific two-machine flow shop problem in O(N log N) or O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed so far maintain the optimal relative order determined by Johnson's rule.; The current makespan is the minimum possible for the jobs already scheduled.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs based on Johnson's rule criteria: jobs with min(a_i, b_i).; Prioritize jobs with shorter machine 1 times or longer machine 2 times for early scheduling.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying Johnson's rule to problems with more than two machines, where it is not optimal.; Incorrectly sorting jobs within the two partitioned sets.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to uniquely encode or decode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers, or to count the number of spanning trees for a complete graph. It's also useful for problems involving tree properties like degree sequences.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence representing a labeled tree, allowing conversion between a tree and a sequence of numbers. Its generation and decoding typically involve an iterative process of finding and removing leaves, achieving O(N log N) or O(N) complexity with optimized leaf finding.
//   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always has N-2 elements for an N-vertex tree.; Each vertex's degree is correctly maintained throughout the process.
//   • Tips: Maintain a degree array to efficiently find leaves.; Use a min-priority queue or a two-pointer approach for finding the smallest leaf.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in sequence length or vertex indexing.; Incorrectly handling the last two vertices during decoding.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
