// Problem Description:
// Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.
//
// A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
//
// You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.
//
// Example:
// Input: num = 16
// Output: true
// Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= num <= 231 - 1
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing a unimodal function (finding its maximum or minimum) over a continuous interval, where direct differentiation is hard or impossible.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a given interval by repeatedly narrowing the search space. It evaluates the function at two internal points to achieve logarithmic convergence.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function f(x) is always within the current interval [l, r].; The function f(x) remains unimodal within the current interval [l, r].
//   • Tips: Use a fixed number of iterations as a stopping criterion instead of an epsilon value for robustness against floating point errors.; For golden section search, reuse one function evaluation from the previous step to minimize expensive computations.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying this algorithm to a non-unimodal function will yield an incorrect result.; Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect comparisons or infinite loops if `eps` is too small.
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When searching for a specific element in a sorted collection or finding an optimal value over a monotonic function within a defined range. It efficiently reduces the search space by half in each step.
//   • Idea: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or determines a value that satisfies a monotonic predicate. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The potential answer always lies within the current search interval `[low, high]`.; All elements strictly less than `low` have been determined not to be the answer.
//   • Tips: Ensure the search space exhibits a monotonic property.; Carefully define the `low` and `high` bounds for the search interval.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating `low` or `high` bounds leading to infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing or loop conditions.
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, recursion)
//   • When to use: When searching for the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a continuous or discrete interval. It is efficient for functions where direct differentiation or analytical solutions are complex.
//   • Idea: Ternary search is an algorithm that efficiently finds the extremum of a unimodal function within a given interval by repeatedly narrowing the search space. It typically achieves a logarithmic time complexity, O(log N), where N is the interval size.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function always lies within the current search interval [l, r].; The function value at m1 is compared with m2 to narrow the interval while preserving unimodality.
//   • Tips: Ensure the function is strictly unimodal within the search interval.; Handle discrete intervals carefully, especially the stopping condition (r - l) < 3.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying to non-unimodal functions yields incorrect results.; Incorrect stopping conditions can lead to infinite loops or suboptimal answers.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
