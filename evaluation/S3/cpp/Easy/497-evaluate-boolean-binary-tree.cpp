//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the root of a full binary tree with the following properties:
//
//
// 	Leaf nodes have either the value 0 or 1, where 0 represents False and 1 represents True.
// 	Non-leaf nodes have either the value 2 or 3, where 2 represents the boolean OR and 3 represents the boolean AND.
//
//
// The evaluation of a node is as follows:
//
//
// 	If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.e. True or False.
// 	Otherwise, evaluate the node's two children and apply the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.
//
//
// Return the boolean result of evaluating the root node.
//
// A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children.
//
// A leaf node is a node that has zero children.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [2,1,3,null,null,0,1]
// Output: true
// Explanation: The above diagram illustrates the evaluation process.
// The AND node evaluates to False AND True = False.
// The OR node evaluates to True OR False = True.
// The root node evaluates to True, so we return true.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
// 	0 <= Node.val <= 3
// 	Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
// 	Leaf nodes have a value of 0 or 1.
// 	Non-leaf nodes have a value of 2 or 3.

// - Games on arbitrary graphs (graph, array, dfs, game-theory)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw) for every possible starting position in a two-player game played on a directed graph, assuming both players play optimally.
//   • Idea: This algorithm classifies each vertex in a directed graph as a winning, losing, or draw state for a two-player game. It iteratively applies rules based on neighbor states, optimized by a Depth-First Search on the reversed graph, achieving an O(M) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: A vertex `u` is a winning state if and only if it has at least one successor `v` that is a losing state.; A vertex `u` is a losing state if and only if all its successors `v` are winning states.
//   • Tips: Construct the reversed graph to efficiently propagate state classifications from successors to predecessors.; Initialize states for terminal vertices (those with no outgoing edges) as losing states.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to account for draw states, which occur when neither winning nor losing conditions are met.; Incorrectly classifying terminal nodes; they are typically losing states in normal play games.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
