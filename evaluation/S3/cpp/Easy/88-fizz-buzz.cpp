// Problem Description:
// Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
//
//
// 	answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
// 	answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
// 	answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
// 	answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3
// Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 104

// - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit or precompute primality for a range. It is efficient for generating primes within a reasonable upper bound.
//   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer by iteratively marking multiples of primes as composite. It achieves a time complexity of O(N log log N).
//   • Invariants: All numbers less than the current prime 'p' have already been processed.; If 'i' is marked as prime, then all its multiples less than 'i*i' have been marked composite by smaller primes.
//   • Tips: Optimize by starting inner loop from p*p, as smaller multiples would have been marked.; Use a boolean array for primality, or an integer array to store smallest prime factor (SPF).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0 and 1, which are neither prime nor composite.; Off-by-one errors when setting array bounds or loop conditions.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
// - Linear Sieve (array, sieve)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a given limit N, or compute the least prime factor for all numbers in that range, efficiently in linear time.
//   • Idea: The Linear Sieve finds all prime numbers up to N in O(N) time by ensuring each composite number is marked exactly once by its least prime factor. It also computes the least prime factor for every number up to N.
//   • Invariants: The 'primes' list always contains all prime numbers found so far in increasing order.; lpf[i] stores the least prime factor of 'i' if 'i' is composite, or 'i' itself if 'i' is prime.
//   • Tips: Store the least prime factor (LPF) for each number in an array.; Maintain a dynamically growing list of primes found so far.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly marking multiples can lead to O(N log log N) or worse complexity.; Forgetting to store the least prime factor can break the linear time guarantee.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
