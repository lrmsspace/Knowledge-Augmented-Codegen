// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.
//
// To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.
//
//
// 	For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].
//
//
// To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.
//
//
// 	For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].
//
// Example:
// Input: image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
// Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
// Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
// Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
//
// Constraints:
// n == image.length
// 	n == image[i].length
// 	1 <= n <= 20
// 	images[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

// - Gray code (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
//   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
//   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (array, stack, monotonic-stack, max-window)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to find the largest rectangular submatrix composed entirely of zeros within a binary matrix. It efficiently reduces the 2D problem to a series of 1D largest rectangle in histogram problems.
//   • Idea: The algorithm transforms a 2D matrix problem into a series of 1D 'largest rectangle in histogram' problems, one for each row. It uses a monotonic stack to find the nearest smaller elements for each bar in O(N) time, leading to an overall O(N*M) complexity for the 2D problem.
//   • Invariants: The stack always stores indices of elements in strictly increasing order of their corresponding heights.; When an element is popped from the stack, the element below it is its nearest smaller element to the left.
//   • Tips: Precompute heights for each column, representing consecutive zeros upwards from the current row.; The 2D problem is effectively reduced to finding the largest rectangle in a histogram for each row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when using the stack (e.g., empty stack, end of array).; Off-by-one errors when calculating the width of the rectangle (k2 - k1 - 1).
// - Gray code (number, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when a sequence of binary numbers is needed where successive values differ by only one bit. This is useful for error detection in digital systems or position encoders.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit position. Conversion from a binary number `n` to its Gray code `G(n)` is `n ^ (n >> 1)`, and the inverse operation can also be performed efficiently in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: For binary to Gray: The resulting Gray code `G(n)` differs from `n` by exactly one bit for each `n`.; For inverse Gray to binary: The variable `n` accumulates the correct binary value from MSB to LSB.
//   • Tips: Understand the core `n ^ (n >> 1)` transformation for binary to Gray.; The inverse Gray code conversion involves iteratively XORing with right-shifted values.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation.; Incorrectly implementing the iterative inverse transformation logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
