// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-absolute-differences-in-a-sorted-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order.
//
// Build and return an integer array result with the same length as nums such that result[i] is equal to the summation of absolute differences between nums[i] and all the other elements in the array.
//
// In other words, result[i] is equal to sum(|nums[i]-nums[j]|) where 0 <= j < nums.length and j != i (0-indexed).
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,3,5]
// Output: [4,3,5]
// Explanation: Assuming the arrays are 0-indexed, then
// result[0] = |2-2| + |2-3| + |2-5| = 0 + 1 + 3 = 4,
// result[1] = |3-2| + |3-3| + |3-5| = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3,
// result[2] = |5-2| + |5-3| + |5-5| = 3 + 2 + 0 = 5.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] <= 104

// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It provides logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that can efficiently update individual elements and calculate prefix sums in an array. Both operations are performed in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each `tree[i]` element stores the sum of a contiguous range of elements from the original array, specifically from `i - (i & -i) + 1` to `i` (inclusive, 1-based).; After any `update(idx, val)` operation, `query(idx)` will reflect the new sum up to `idx`.
//   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for array elements to simplify bitwise logic; The `idx & -idx` operation is key to navigating the implicit tree structure
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 0-based and 1-based indexing can lead to incorrect results; Off-by-one errors when calculating range sums (e.g., `query(R) - query(L-1)`)
// - Finding area of simple polygon in O(N) (geometry, array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When you need to calculate the area of a simple polygon given its vertices in sequential order. It efficiently handles both convex and non-convex polygons.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon by summing the signed areas of trapezoids or triangles formed by its edges and a reference point/axis. It achieves O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sum accumulates the signed area contribution of processed edges.; The current vertex and the next vertex define an edge of the polygon.
//   • Tips: Ensure vertices are provided in sequential order (clockwise or counter-clockwise).; The absolute value of the final result is the polygon's area.
//   • Pitfalls: Supplying vertices in a non-sequential or arbitrary order will yield an incorrect area.; Applying the formula to self-intersecting polygons will not give the true geometric area.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
