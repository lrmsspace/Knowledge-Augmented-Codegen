// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-elements-to-groups-with-constraints/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array groups, where groups[i] represents the size of the ith group. You are also given an integer array elements.
//
// Your task is to assign one element to each group based on the following rules:
//
//
// 	An element at index j can be assigned to a group i if groups[i] is divisible by elements[j].
// 	If there are multiple elements that can be assigned, assign the element with the smallest index j.
// 	If no element satisfies the condition for a group, assign -1 to that group.
//
//
// Return an integer array assigned, where assigned[i] is the index of the element chosen for group i, or -1 if no suitable element exists.
//
// Note: An element may be assigned to more than one group.
//
// Example:
// Input: groups = [8,4,3,2,4], elements = [4,2]
//
// Output: [0,0,-1,1,0]
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	elements[0] = 4 is assigned to groups 0, 1, and 4.
// 	elements[1] = 2 is assigned to group 3.
// 	Group 2 cannot be assigned any element.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= groups.length <= 105
// 	1 <= elements.length <= 105
// 	1 <= groups[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= elements[i] <= 105

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Euler's totient function
//  (array, number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to count positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. It is also efficient for computing totient values for all numbers in a given range.
//   • Idea: Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. It can be computed for a single n in O(sqrt(n)) using prime factorization, or for all numbers up to N in O(N log log N) using a sieve-like algorithm.
//   • Invariants: phi[i] stores the current totient value for i, which is i initially, then updated by (1 - 1/p) for each prime p dividing i.; After iterating through all primes p up to sqrt(N), phi[i] holds the correct totient value for all i <= N.
//   • Tips: For a single n, compute φ(n) using its prime factorization.; For all φ(i) up to N, use a sieve approach similar to Sieve of Eratosthenes.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing 'relatively prime' with 'prime number'.; Applying the multiplicative property incorrectly when numbers share common factors.
// - Integer factorization (number, array, enumeration, sieve, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find the prime factors of a composite number, especially for relatively small numbers or as a base case for more advanced algorithms.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the prime factorization of an integer by iteratively dividing it by its smallest prime factors. It typically checks divisors up to the square root of the number, achieving an O(sqrt(N)) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The product of all found prime factors multiplied by the current remaining number equals the original input number.; All prime factors found so far are less than or equal to the current divisor being tested.
//   • Tips: Perform a primality test first to avoid unnecessary factorization attempts.; Only check divisors up to the square root of the number.
//   • Pitfalls: Trial division is pseudo-polynomial time, making it inefficient for very large numbers.; Forgetting to handle the case where the remaining number after division is itself a prime greater than its original square root.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
