//
// Problem Description:
// The problem involves tracking the frequency of IDs in a collection that changes over time. You have two integer arrays, nums and freq, of equal length n. Each element in nums represents an ID, and the corresponding element in freq indicates how many times that ID should be added to or removed from the collection at each step.
//
//
// 	Addition of IDs: If freq[i] is positive, it means freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are added to the collection at step i.
// 	Removal of IDs: If freq[i] is negative, it means -freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are removed from the collection at step i.
//
//
// Return an array ans of length n, where ans[i] represents the count of the most frequent ID in the collection after the ith step. If the collection is empty at any step, ans[i] should be 0 for that step.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,3,2,1], freq = [3,2,-3,1]
//
// Output: [3,3,2,2]
//
// Explanation:
//
// After step 0, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2. So ans[0] = 3.
// After step 1, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2 and 2 IDs with the value of 3. So ans[1] = 3.
// After step 2, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 2.
// After step 3, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3 and 1 ID with the value of 1. So ans[3] = 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length == freq.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	-105 <= freq[i] <= 105
// 	freq[i] != 0
// 	The input is generated such that the occurrences of an ID will not be negative in any step.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (ds, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently find the smallest non-negative integer not present in a dynamic sequence or range, supporting both updates and queries in logarithmic time.
//   • Idea: This technique finds the Minimal Excluded (MEX) value in a sequence by maintaining counts of distinct elements in ranges using a specialized data structure, typically a segment tree. It supports both updates and queries in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each segment tree node accurately reflects the count of distinct numbers within its corresponding range.; If a range [L, R) contains R-L distinct numbers, then all integers from L to R-1 are present.
//   • Tips: Implement a segment tree where each node stores the count of distinct numbers in its range.; The binary search for MEX checks if a range [0, k) contains k distinct numbers to decide which child to traverse.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating distinct counts in segment tree nodes, especially after updates.; Off-by-one errors when comparing the number of distinct elements with the expected count for a full range.
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, queue, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent insertions or deletions at the beginning or end of a collection are required, or when the collection size is highly dynamic and unpredictable.
//   • Idea: Linked lists implement dynamic collections like queues and stacks by chaining nodes, each holding an item and a reference to the next node. Operations like adding or removing elements at the ends typically achieve O(1) time complexity, while random access is O(N).
//   • Invariants: The `first` pointer always references the head node, or is null if the list is empty.; The `last` pointer always references the tail node, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Maintain separate `first` and `last` pointers for O(1) enqueue/dequeue operations.; Keep a `size` counter to provide O(1) size retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update `first` or `last` pointers correctly can lead to broken lists or memory leaks.; Null pointer exceptions are common when traversing or modifying an empty or partially traversed list.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (tree, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently find the MEX of a sequence after multiple point updates, where the sequence elements are non-negative integers.
//   • Idea: This approach uses a segment tree or similar data structure to maintain counts of elements, allowing efficient O(log N) updates and O(log N) queries for the minimal excluded number (MEX). The core idea is to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sequence.
//   • Invariants: Each node in the segment tree correctly stores the count of distinct numbers within its represented range.; The MEX query always explores the leftmost child first if its range is not 'full' (i.e., missing elements).
//   • Tips: Build the tree over the range of possible non-negative integer values, typically up to N or a maximum constraint.; Each tree node should store the count of distinct numbers present within its represented range.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle numbers larger than the maximum range covered by the segment tree.; Incorrectly updating counts for elements, leading to stale or erroneous MEX values.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
