// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/using-a-robot-to-print-the-lexicographically-smallest-string/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s and a robot that currently holds an empty string t. Apply one of the following operations until s and t are both empty:
//
//
// 	Remove the first character of a string s and give it to the robot. The robot will append this character to the string t.
// 	Remove the last character of a string t and give it to the robot. The robot will write this character on paper.
//
//
// Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "zza"
// Output: "azz"
// Explanation: Let p denote the written string.
// Initially p="", s="zza", t="".
// Perform first operation three times p="", s="", t="zza".
// Perform second operation three times p="azz", s="", t="".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s consists of only English lowercase letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Lyndon factorization (string, greedy, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to decompose a string into a unique sequence of Lyndon words, which are lexicographically smallest among their cyclic shifts. It is also applicable for finding the smallest cyclic shift of a string.
//   • Idea: The Duval algorithm greedily factorizes a string into a sequence of Lyndon words by maintaining three pointers to manage processed, pre-simple, and untouched parts. It achieves this in O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The prefix s[0...i-1] always contains a valid Lyndon factorization.; The substring s[i...j-1] is always a pre-simple string.
//   • Tips: Thoroughly understand the definitions of 'simple string' and 'pre-simple string' to correctly apply the comparison logic.; The three pointers (i, j, k) are crucial; 'i' marks the start of the current pre-simple string, 'j' the start of the untouched part, and 'k' for comparison within the pre-simple string.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly resetting the 'k' pointer when s[j] > s[k], which should point back to the beginning of the simple word within s2.; Misinterpreting the length of the simple string (j - k) when a factorization step occurs.
// - Suffix Array (array, string, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently compare substrings, find all occurrences of a pattern, or determine lexicographical order among suffixes within a string.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Array stores sorted suffixes of a string, enabling fast substring comparisons and pattern searching. Construction typically takes O(N log N) time, with comparisons often O(1) after preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array `p` contains all suffixes of the string `s` sorted lexicographically.; During construction, equivalence classes `c` correctly group suffixes that are identical up to a certain length `2^k`.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values for efficient block length calculation.; Utilize equivalence classes for O(1) comparison of power-of-two length substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Complexity of suffix array construction can be tricky (e.g., O(N log N) vs O(N)).; Off-by-one errors when calculating block indices or lengths.
// - Suffix array (array, string, suffix-array, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use suffix arrays for efficient string processing tasks like finding all occurrences of a pattern, locating the longest common substring, or performing various substring queries. It provides a sorted index of all suffixes.
//   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing their starting indices in lexicographical order. It enables various string operations to be performed efficiently, often with O(N log N) or O(N) time complexity for construction and O(M log N) or O(M) for queries.
//   • Invariants: The suffix array A always contains N elements, where N is the length of the original string.; For any valid index i, A[i] stores a starting position within the original string S.
//   • Tips: Append a unique sentinel character (e.g., '$') to the string to ensure all suffixes are distinct.; Combine with a Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array for enhanced functionality, such as counting distinct substrings.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive construction by sorting all suffixes directly is inefficient (O(N^2 log N) or worse).; Implementing advanced construction algorithms from scratch can be complex and error-prone.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
