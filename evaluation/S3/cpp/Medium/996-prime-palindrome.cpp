// Problem Description:
// Given an integer n, return the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to n.
//
// An integer is prime if it has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. Note that 1 is not a prime number.
//
//
// 	For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are all primes.
//
//
// An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.
//
//
// 	For example, 101 and 12321 are palindromes.
//
//
// The test cases are generated so that the answer always exists and is in the range [2, 2 * 108].
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 6
// Output: 7
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 108
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Primality tests (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to determine if a single number is prime, especially for numbers where trial division up to its square root is computationally feasible.
//   • Idea: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This method checks for primality by attempting to find a non-trivial divisor up to the square root of the given number, running in O(sqrt(N)) time.
//   • Invariants: No integer k in the range [2, current_divisor - 1] has been found to divide n.; The current value current_divisor is a candidate divisor being tested against n.
//   • Tips: Only check numbers between 2 and sqrt(n).; Handle 2 as a special case before iterating.
//   • Pitfalls: O(sqrt(N)) complexity can be too slow for very large numbers.; Incorrectly handling edge cases like 0, 1, or 2.
// - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit or precompute primality for a range. It is efficient for generating primes within a reasonable upper bound.
//   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer by iteratively marking multiples of primes as composite. It achieves a time complexity of O(N log log N).
//   • Invariants: All numbers less than the current prime 'p' have already been processed.; If 'i' is marked as prime, then all its multiples less than 'i*i' have been marked composite by smaller primes.
//   • Tips: Optimize by starting inner loop from p*p, as smaller multiples would have been marked.; Use a boolean array for primality, or an integer array to store smallest prime factor (SPF).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0 and 1, which are neither prime nor composite.; Off-by-one errors when setting array bounds or loop conditions.
// - Linear Sieve (array, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a given limit N, or the smallest prime factor for every number up to N, with optimal linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: The Linear Sieve efficiently computes all prime numbers up to a limit N and the smallest prime factor for each integer. It processes every composite number exactly once by its smallest prime factor, achieving O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For all `k < i`, `lp[k]` correctly stores the smallest prime factor of `k` (or `k` itself if prime).; The `pr` list contains all prime numbers less than `i` in ascending order.
//   • Tips: Initialize an array `lp` to store the smallest prime factor for each number.; Maintain a dynamically growing list of prime numbers found so far.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly marking composite numbers multiple times, leading to non-linear complexity.; Failing to stop the inner loop when `p > lp[i]`, which breaks the linearity guarantee.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
