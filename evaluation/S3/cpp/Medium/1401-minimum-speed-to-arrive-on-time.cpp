// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-speed-to-arrive-on-time/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a floating-point number hour, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take n trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the distance (in kilometers) of the ith train ride.
//
// Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.
//
//
// 	For example, if the 1st train ride takes 1.5 hours, you must wait for an additional 0.5 hours before you can depart on the 2nd train ride at the 2 hour mark.
//
//
// Return the minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour) that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or -1 if it is impossible to be on time.
//
// Tests are generated such that the answer will not exceed 107 and hour will have at most two digits after the decimal point.
//
// Example:
// Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 6
// Output: 1
// Explanation: At speed 1:
// - The first train ride takes 1/1 = 1 hour.
// - Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 1 hour mark. The second train takes 3/1 = 3 hours.
// - Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 4 hour mark. The third train takes 2/1 = 2 hours.
// - You will arrive at exactly the 6 hour mark.
//
// Constraints:
// n == dist.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= dist[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= hour <= 109
// 	There will be at most two digits after the decimal point in hour.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
