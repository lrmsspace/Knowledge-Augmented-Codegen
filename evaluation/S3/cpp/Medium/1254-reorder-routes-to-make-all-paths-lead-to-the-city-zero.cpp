// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.
//
// Roads are represented by connections where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a road from city ai to city bi.
//
// This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to travel to this city.
//
// Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0. Return the minimum number of edges changed.
//
// It's guaranteed that each city can reach city 0 after reorder.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 5 * 104
// 	connections.length == n - 1
// 	connections[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
// 	ai != bi

// - Strongly connected components and the condensation graph (graph, array, dfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this when systematically exploring all possible configurations, paths, or subsets within a graph or array. It's ideal for finding every solution or verifying properties across all potential states.
//   • Idea: Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. When combined with enumeration, it systematically generates all possible combinations or paths, typically with exponential time complexity O(V+E) for traversal or O(N!) / O(2^N) for enumeration.
//   • Invariants: The current path/subset being built is valid up to the current depth.; All previously explored branches from the current node have been fully processed.
//   • Tips: Define clear base cases for recursion termination.; Manage state changes carefully when entering and exiting recursive calls.
//   • Pitfalls: Infinite recursion due to missing or incorrect base cases.; Redundant computations if states are not properly managed or memoized.
// - Directed Graphs (graph, array, dfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when modeling relationships with a specific flow direction between entities. It is ideal for determining reachability or finding paths from one or more sources.
//   • Idea: Directed graphs represent connections where edges have a specific direction, often implemented using adjacency lists. Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) are fundamental algorithms for traversing these graphs to find paths and determine reachability in O(V+E) time.
//   • Invariants: The 'visited' set accurately reflects all nodes for which traversal has been initiated.; For DFS, all nodes reachable from the current node via unvisited paths will eventually be explored.
//   • Tips: Always use a 'visited' set or array to prevent infinite loops in cycles and redundant processing.; Adjacency list representation is generally preferred for sparse graphs due to better space and time complexity for traversal.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle cycles can lead to infinite loops or stack overflows in DFS.; Incorrectly applying algorithms designed for undirected graphs to directed graphs without modification.
// - Undirected Graphs (graph, array, simulation)
//   • When to use: When modeling symmetric relationships between entities and needing to explore, analyze connectivity, or find paths within the network. Useful for problems involving reachability or structural properties.
//   • Idea: Undirected graphs represent symmetric relationships between pairs of vertices. Simulation on them involves systematically exploring or processing these connections, often with O(V+E) complexity for basic traversals.
//   • Invariants: All vertices reachable from the source within 'k' edges have been processed by the 'k'-th step of BFS.; Each edge in the graph is traversed at most twice (once for each direction) during a full graph traversal.
//   • Tips: Use an adjacency list for sparse graphs to optimize space and traversal time.; Use an adjacency matrix for dense graphs or when O(1) edge existence checks are critical.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected components, leading to incomplete graph processing.; Incorrectly representing undirected edges (e.g., only adding one direction to an adjacency list).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
