// Problem Description:
// Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.
//
// The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).
//
// The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).
//
// Example:
// Input: ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2
// Output: 45
//
// Constraints:
// -104 <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 104
// 	-104 <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 104
// 	-104 <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 104
// 	-104 <= by1 <= by2 <= 104

// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
// - Check if two segments intersect (geometry, number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this when determining if two line segments in a 2D plane share any common points, especially when floating-point precision issues need to be avoided.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect by handling collinear and non-collinear cases separately, primarily using integer arithmetic to avoid precision errors. It typically runs in O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: If segments are collinear, their 1D projections on both axes must overlap for intersection.; If segments are not collinear, each segment's endpoints must lie on opposite sides of the line containing the other segment.
//   • Tips: Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.; Utilize cross products for efficient orientation checks.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly identify and handle collinear segments.; Introducing floating-point errors by using division for slopes.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, interval, simulation, interval-scheduling)
//   • When to use: When determining if two line segments in 2D space cross, touch, or overlap, and to find the nature of their intersection (point, segment, or empty).
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if two line segments intersect and calculates their intersection point or segment. It typically involves checking for orientation changes and handling special cases like collinearity, with an O(1) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The bounding boxes of the two segments must overlap for an intersection to be possible.; If segments are collinear, their intersection is either empty, a point, or a sub-segment.
//   • Tips: Use a bounding box check first for early exit optimization.; Handle collinear segments as a distinct special case.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling parallel or perfectly collinear segments.; Floating point inaccuracies leading to false positives or negatives.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
