// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-rand10-using-rand7/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the API rand7() that generates a uniform random integer in the range [1, 7], write a function rand10() that generates a uniform random integer in the range [1, 10]. You can only call the API rand7(), and you shouldn't call any other API. Please do not use a language's built-in random API.
//
// Each test case will have one internal argument n, the number of times that your implemented function rand10() will be called while testing. Note that this is not an argument passed to rand10().
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 1
// Output: [2]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
//
//
//  
// Follow up:
//
//
// 	What is the expected value for the number of calls to rand7() function?
// 	Could you minimize the number of calls to rand7()?

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Gray code (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
//   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
//   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Bit manipulation (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when operations on individual bits of an integer are required, for optimizing arithmetic with powers of two, or for efficient management of boolean flags.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators and shifts. These operations typically have O(1) time complexity as they are hardware-level instructions.
//   • Invariants: The total number of bits representing the integer remains constant for fixed-width types.; Applying `n & (1 << k)` isolates the k-th bit, setting all other bits to zero.
//   • Tips: Use `&` with `(1 << k)` to check if the k-th bit is set.; Use `|` with `(1 << k)` to set the k-th bit.
//   • Pitfalls: Be aware of integer overflow when performing large left shifts.; Understand the difference between arithmetic and logical right shifts, especially for signed numbers.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

// The rand7() API is already defined for you.
// int rand7();
// @return a random integer in the range 1 to 7

class Solution {
public:
    int rand10() {
        while (true) {
            int num = (rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7(); // Generate a number in the range [1, 49]
            if (num <= 40) { // Only consider numbers in the range [1, 40]
                return (num - 1) % 10 + 1; // Map to [1, 10]
            }
        }
