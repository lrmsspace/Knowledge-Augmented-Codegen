// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-lines-to-represent-a-line-chart/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array stockPrices where stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei] indicates the price of the stock on day dayi is pricei. A line chart is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:
//
// Return the minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart.
//
// Example:
// Input: stockPrices = [[1,7],[2,6],[3,5],[4,4],[5,4],[6,3],[7,2],[8,1]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// The diagram above represents the input, with the X-axis representing the day and Y-axis representing the price.
// The following 3 lines can be drawn to represent the line chart:
// - Line 1 (in red) from (1,7) to (4,4) passing through (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4,4).
// - Line 2 (in blue) from (4,4) to (5,4).
// - Line 3 (in green) from (5,4) to (8,1) passing through (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), and (8,1).
// It can be shown that it is not possible to represent the line chart using less than 3 lines.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= stockPrices.length <= 105
// 	stockPrices[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= dayi, pricei <= 109
// 	All dayi are distinct.
//

// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
//   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
// - Convex hull trick and Li Chao tree (array, number, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when the optimal solution for a subproblem depends only on solutions to smaller, contiguous subproblems. It's effective for optimizing sequential decision-making or finding optimal values in arrays.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming 1D solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results to avoid recomputation. It typically achieves O(N) or O(N log N) time and O(N) or O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] correctly stores the optimal solution for the subproblem ending at index i.; All dp[j] for j < i have been computed and are correct.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the state: what does dp[i] represent for the subproblem?; Establish correct base cases for the smallest subproblems.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the state or recurrence relation.; Missing or incorrect base cases, leading to incorrect results.
// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem involves finding an optimal value for a contiguous range of elements, and solutions for larger ranges can be derived by merging optimal solutions of smaller sub-ranges.
//   • Idea: An extension of dynamic programming where subproblems are defined over contiguous intervals, solving for dp[i][j] by iterating through all possible split points k within [i, j]. This often results in O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i][j] represents the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; When computing dp[i][j], all subproblems dp[x][y] where y - x + 1 < j - i + 1 are already solved.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.; Incorrect iteration order, leading to uncomputed subproblems.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
