// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.
//
// if no such substring exists, return 0.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 104
// 	s consists of only lowercase English letters.
// 	1 <= k <= 105

// - Finding repetitions (string, array, z-function, enumeration)
//   • When to use: This algorithm efficiently finds all repetitions (periodic substrings) within a given string by combining divide-and-conquer with the Z-function. It is particularly useful for identifying overlapping or crossing periodic patterns.
//   • Idea: The Main-Lorentz algorithm finds all repetitions in a string by recursively splitting it into halves and identifying 'crossing repetitions' using the Z-function. This approach achieves an optimal O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed `cntr` position, all identified crossing repetitions have a total length of $2 	imes (|u| - cntr)$.; The segment $u[cntr - k_1 	ext{ to } cntr - 1]$ is identical to $u[|u| - k_1 	ext{ to } |u| - 1]$.
//   • Tips: Employ divide-and-conquer to break the problem into subproblems for repetitions within halves and crossing repetitions.; Utilize the Z-function to compute $k_1$ and $k_2$ values in O(1) for each `cntr` position, speeding up crossing repetition detection.
//   • Pitfalls: Correctly identifying and defining 'crossing repetitions' is the most intricate part of the algorithm.; Careful implementation of the Z-function for both the original and reversed string segments is crucial.
// - String Sorts (array, string, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to sort a collection of strings lexicographically, especially when string lengths vary or are large, and the character set is limited.
//   • Idea: This algorithm sorts an array of strings lexicographically by recursively applying a counting sort-like distribution based on characters from most significant to least significant digit. It typically achieves O(N*L + R*L) time complexity, where N is the number of strings, L is the average string length, and R is the radix size.
//   • Invariants: All strings in the current `a[lo...hi]` sub-array share a common prefix of length `d`.; After the distribution pass for character `d`, `aux` contains strings from `a[lo...hi]` stably sorted by their `d`-th character.
//   • Tips: Use an auxiliary array for stable distribution during each pass to maintain relative order.; Implement a cutoff to insertion sort for small sub-arrays to improve performance due to lower overhead.
//   • Pitfalls: Can have high overhead for small N or short strings compared to comparison sorts.; Potentially memory intensive due to the auxiliary array and recursion stack depth proportional to max string length.
// - Finding repetitions (string, divide-and-conquer, recursion)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to find all occurrences of repeating substrings within a given string. It is suitable for problems requiring the identification of periodic patterns or structural redundancies.
//   • Idea: This algorithm, often exemplified by Main-Lorentz, uses a divide-and-conquer strategy with Z-function as a subroutine to efficiently find all repetitions in a string. It typically achieves an O(N log N) time complexity for finding and describing repetitions.
//   • Invariants: All repetitions fully contained within the left or right subproblems are found recursively.; Crossing repetitions are identified by combining information from both subproblems using Z-function.
//   • Tips: Understand the definition of a 'repetition' (e.g., Crochemore triples or (i, p, r) tuples).; Leverage string algorithms like Z-function for efficient substring matching in subproblems.
//   • Pitfalls: Expanding compact repetition tuples to full start/end indices can lead to O(N^2) complexity.; Incorrectly handling string reversal or concatenation for Z-function applications.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
