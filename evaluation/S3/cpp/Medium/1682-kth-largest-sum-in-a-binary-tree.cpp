// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-sum-in-a-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the root of a binary tree and a positive integer k.
//
// The level sum in the tree is the sum of the values of the nodes that are on the same level.
//
// Return the kth largest level sum in the tree (not necessarily distinct). If there are fewer than k levels in the tree, return -1.
//
// Note that two nodes are on the same level if they have the same distance from the root.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], k = 2
// Output: 13
// Explanation: The level sums are the following:
// - Level 1: 5.
// - Level 2: 8 + 9 = 17.
// - Level 3: 2 + 1 + 3 + 7 = 13.
// - Level 4: 4 + 6 = 10.
// The 2nd largest level sum is 13.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is n.
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= Node.val <= 106
// 	1 <= k <= n
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Breadth-first search (graph, array, bfs, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or traversing a graph level by level to explore all reachable nodes. It is also suitable for finding connected components or checking reachability.
//   • Idea: Breadth-first search explores a graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in terms of edges from a source node to all other reachable nodes. It typically runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or next level of traversal from the source.; All nodes already dequeued have been fully processed, and their unvisited neighbors have been enqueued.
//   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit in a FIFO manner.; Mark nodes as visited immediately upon adding them to the queue to prevent redundant processing and cycles.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs or incorrect path lengths.; Not handling disconnected components if the goal is to traverse the entire graph.
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent point updates and range sum queries are needed on an array. It offers logarithmic time complexity for both operations, making it more efficient than a simple prefix sum array for dynamic data.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that efficiently calculates prefix sums and updates individual elements in an array. Both operations typically run in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each node `tree[i]` stores the sum of a specific range of elements ending at index `i`.; The length of the range summed by `tree[i]` is determined by `i & (-i)` (lowbit operation).
//   • Tips: Understand the lowbit operation and its role in navigating the tree structure.; Use 1-based indexing for simpler implementation of lowbit calculations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting 1-based indexing can lead to off-by-one errors and incorrect results.; Incorrectly implementing the lowbit calculation or update/query logic.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, queue, array, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) from a source node to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph. It is also suitable for exploring a graph layer by layer.
//   • Idea: BFS systematically explores a graph level by level, starting from a source node, ensuring all nodes at a given distance are visited before moving to the next distance level. It operates in O(N + M) time for N vertices and M edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or adjacent distance level from the source.; The 'used' array accurately reflects all nodes that have been added to the queue for processing.
//   • Tips: Always use a queue to maintain the order of nodes to visit.; Utilize a 'visited' array or set to prevent revisiting nodes and infinite loops.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not find shortest paths in weighted graphs unless weights are 0 or 1 (use Dijkstra for general weighted graphs).; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to incorrect results or TLE.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
