// Problem Description:
// Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.
//
// Example:
// Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
// Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
// 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
// 	0 <= k <= 2 * 109
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Josephus Problem (number, simulation, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the survivor's position in a circular game where every k-th person is eliminated, especially for large N where direct simulation is too slow.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the position of the last remaining person in the Josephus problem by iteratively reducing the problem size using a recursive formula and modulo arithmetic. It achieves an optimized time complexity of O(k log n).
//   • Invariants: The number of remaining elements decreases in each recursive step.; The relative order of the remaining elements is preserved throughout the process.
//   • Tips: Handle the base case where n < k separately to avoid infinite loops or incorrect calculations.; Use 0-indexing for simpler modulo arithmetic in the recursive formulas.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling index shifts after elements are removed can lead to wrong results.; Forgetting the base case n < k can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect behavior.
// - Floyd's Linked List Cycle Finding Algorithm (linked-list, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently detect if a linked list contains a cycle and, optionally, find the entry point of that cycle, using only constant extra space.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses two pointers, one moving faster than the other, to detect if a cycle exists in a linked list. If a cycle is found, it can then determine the cycle's starting node in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The slow and fast pointers are always valid nodes or null.; In the detection phase, the fast pointer always covers twice the distance of the slow pointer.
//   • Tips: Initialize both slow and fast pointers at the head of the list.; Move the slow pointer by one step and the fast pointer by two steps in each iteration.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check for null on 'fast' and 'fast.next' before dereferencing them.; Incorrectly assuming the list is non-empty or has at least two nodes.
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, queue, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent insertions or deletions at the beginning or end of a collection are required, or when the collection size is highly dynamic and unpredictable.
//   • Idea: Linked lists implement dynamic collections like queues and stacks by chaining nodes, each holding an item and a reference to the next node. Operations like adding or removing elements at the ends typically achieve O(1) time complexity, while random access is O(N).
//   • Invariants: The `first` pointer always references the head node, or is null if the list is empty.; The `last` pointer always references the tail node, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Maintain separate `first` and `last` pointers for O(1) enqueue/dequeue operations.; Keep a `size` counter to provide O(1) size retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update `first` or `last` pointers correctly can lead to broken lists or memory leaks.; Null pointer exceptions are common when traversing or modifying an empty or partially traversed list.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
