// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You have n dice, and each dice has k faces numbered from 1 to k.
//
// Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 1, k = 6, target = 3
// Output: 1
// Explanation: You throw one die with 6 faces.
// There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n, k <= 30
// 	1 <= target <= 1000

// - Binomial Coefficients (array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to compute many binomial coefficients, especially for values up to a certain N, or when working with modulo arithmetic where division is not straightforward.
//   • Idea: This method computes binomial coefficients using Pascal's identity, building a 2D DP table where C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k). It has a time complexity of O(N^2) for computing all coefficients up to N.
//   • Invariants: For each cell dp[i][j], it stores the value of C(i, j).; At the start of computing row i, all values for row i-1 are correctly calculated and available.
//   • Tips: Optimize space by storing only the current and previous row of the DP table.; For O(1) lookup after precomputation, calculate all factorials and inverse factorials modulo a prime.
//   • Pitfalls: Direct division for C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) is problematic with modulo arithmetic unless the modulo is prime.; Integer overflow can occur for large N and K if not handled with appropriate data types or modulo operations.
// - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when division operations are required in modular arithmetic, especially for combinatorics or probability problems under a modulus. It's crucial for precomputing inverses efficiently for a range of numbers.
//   • Idea: Calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number 'a' modulo 'm', which is an integer 'x' such that (a * x) % m == 1. When precomputing inverses for a range [1, N], a linear time O(N) dynamic programming approach can be used.
//   • Invariants: For all k in [1, i-1], inv[k] correctly stores k^(-1) % m.; inv[i] is computed using previously calculated inv[m % i].
//   • Tips: For prime modulus 'm', a^(m-2) % m (Fermat's Little Theorem) is efficient for a single inverse.; The Extended Euclidean Algorithm works for any 'm' if gcd(a, m) = 1.
//   • Pitfalls: A modular inverse only exists if gcd(a, m) == 1.; Fermat's Little Theorem is only applicable when the modulus 'm' is prime.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, counting, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when counting non-attacking piece placements on a grid, especially when the problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems based on board properties like diagonals.
//   • Idea: This algorithm employs 2D dynamic programming to count the total number of ways to place non-attacking bishops on a chessboard. It leverages the independence of placements on black and white squares/diagonals, achieving a polynomial time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any diagonal `i`, `D[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonal `i`.; Bishops placed on black diagonals do not attack bishops placed on white diagonals.
//   • Tips: Decompose the problem into independent subproblems for black and white squares/diagonals.; Identify the state for DP, typically `dp[diagonal_index][bishops_placed]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the number of squares on each diagonal.; Overlapping bishops if diagonal definitions are not precise.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
