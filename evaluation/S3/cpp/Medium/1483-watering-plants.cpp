// Problem Description:
// You want to water n plants in your garden with a watering can. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i. There is a river at x = -1 that you can refill your watering can at.
//
// Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:
//
//
// 	Water the plants in order from left to right.
// 	After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to completely water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.
// 	You cannot refill the watering can early.
//
//
// You are initially at the river (i.e., x = -1). It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis.
//
// Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and an integer capacity representing the watering can capacity, return the number of steps needed to water all the plants.
//
// Example:
// Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacity = 5
// Output: 14
// Explanation: Start at the river with a full watering can:
// - Walk to plant 0 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 3 units of water.
// - Walk to plant 1 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 1 unit of water.
// - Since you cannot completely water plant 2, walk back to the river to refill (2 steps).
// - Walk to plant 2 (3 steps) and water it. Watering can has 2 units of water.
// - Since you cannot completely water plant 3, walk back to the river to refill (3 steps).
// - Walk to plant 3 (4 steps) and water it.
// Steps needed = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 14.
//
// Constraints:
// n == plants.length
// 	1 <= n <= 1000
// 	1 <= plants[i] <= 106
// 	max(plants[i]) <= capacity <= 109
//

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Length of the union of segments (array, interval, sweep-line, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating the total length or measure of the union of multiple one-dimensional intervals or segments. It efficiently handles overlapping regions to avoid double-counting.
//   • Idea: This algorithm calculates the total length of the union of given line segments by processing sorted endpoints as events. It maintains a counter for active segments, adding the length of intervals where the counter is positive, achieving O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The `active_segments_count` accurately reflects the number of segments covering the interval `[prev_x, current_x]`.; The `total_union_length` accumulates the length of all intervals where `active_segments_count > 0`.
//   • Tips: Represent endpoints as (coordinate, type) pairs, where type indicates start (+1) or end (-1).; Sort event points primarily by coordinate, then by type (e.g., start events before end events for same coordinate).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect sorting order for event points, especially for coincident endpoints.; Forgetting to update the active segment counter when processing an event.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
