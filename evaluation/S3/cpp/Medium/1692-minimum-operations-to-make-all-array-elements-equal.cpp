//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.
//
// You are also given an integer array queries of size m. For the ith query, you want to make all of the elements of nums equal to queries[i]. You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:
//
//
// 	Increase or decrease an element of the array by 1.
//
//
// Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums equal to queries[i].
//
// Note that after each query the array is reset to its original state.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,1,6,8], queries = [1,5]
// Output: [14,10]
// Explanation: For the first query we can do the following operations:
// - Decrease nums[0] 2 times, so that nums = [1,1,6,8].
// - Decrease nums[2] 5 times, so that nums = [1,1,1,8].
// - Decrease nums[3] 7 times, so that nums = [1,1,1,1].
// So the total number of operations for the first query is 2 + 5 + 7 = 14.
// For the second query we can do the following operations:
// - Increase nums[0] 2 times, so that nums = [5,1,6,8].
// - Increase nums[1] 4 times, so that nums = [5,5,6,8].
// - Decrease nums[2] 1 time, so that nums = [5,5,5,8].
// - Decrease nums[3] 3 times, so that nums = [5,5,5,5].
// So the total number of operations for the second query is 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 10.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	m == queries.length
// 	1 <= n, m <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 109
//

// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent range queries and point/range updates are needed on an array, offering a balanced O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations. It's a good alternative when a segment tree is too complex or overkill.
//   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and updates. It achieves an O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both query and update operations.
//   • Invariants: Each block maintains an up-to-date aggregate of its elements.; For any query, fully contained blocks are processed using their precomputed aggregates.
//   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for optimal balance.; Precompute block aggregates (sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling partial blocks or boundary conditions.; Off-by-one errors in block indices or element indices within blocks.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent point updates and range sum queries are needed on an array. It offers logarithmic time complexity for both operations, making it more efficient than a simple prefix sum array for dynamic data.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that efficiently calculates prefix sums and updates individual elements in an array. Both operations typically run in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each node `tree[i]` stores the sum of a specific range of elements ending at index `i`.; The length of the range summed by `tree[i]` is determined by `i & (-i)` (lowbit operation).
//   • Tips: Understand the lowbit operation and its role in navigating the tree structure.; Use 1-based indexing for simpler implementation of lowbit calculations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting 1-based indexing can lead to off-by-one errors and incorrect results.; Incorrectly implementing the lowbit calculation or update/query logic.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
