// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-uni-value-grid/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer grid of size m x n and an integer x. In one operation, you can add x to or subtract x from any element in the grid.
//
// A uni-value grid is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.
//
// Return the minimum number of operations to make the grid uni-value. If it is not possible, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[2,4],[6,8]], x = 2
// Output: 4
// Explanation: We can make every element equal to 4 by doing the following: 
// - Add x to 2 once.
// - Subtract x from 6 once.
// - Subtract x from 8 twice.
// A total of 4 operations were used.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 105
// 	1 <= m * n <= 105
// 	1 <= x, grid[i][j] <= 104

// - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when division operations are required in modular arithmetic, especially for combinatorics or probability problems under a modulus. It's crucial for precomputing inverses efficiently for a range of numbers.
//   • Idea: Calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number 'a' modulo 'm', which is an integer 'x' such that (a * x) % m == 1. When precomputing inverses for a range [1, N], a linear time O(N) dynamic programming approach can be used.
//   • Invariants: For all k in [1, i-1], inv[k] correctly stores k^(-1) % m.; inv[i] is computed using previously calculated inv[m % i].
//   • Tips: For prime modulus 'm', a^(m-2) % m (Fermat's Little Theorem) is efficient for a single inverse.; The Extended Euclidean Algorithm works for any 'm' if gcd(a, m) = 1.
//   • Pitfalls: A modular inverse only exists if gcd(a, m) == 1.; Fermat's Little Theorem is only applicable when the modulus 'm' is prime.
// - Garner's algorithm
//  (number, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when reconstructing a large integer from a system of congruences with pairwise coprime moduli, offering an alternative to the direct Chinese Remainder Theorem approach.
//   • Idea: Garner's algorithm efficiently reconstructs an integer from its remainders modulo a set of pairwise coprime numbers, by computing its mixed radix representation coefficients. It typically runs in O(k^2 log M) time, where k is the number of moduli and M is the maximum modulus, assuming modular inverse takes log M time.
//   • Invariants: At the start of iteration j, the partial sum $V_{j-1}$ satisfies $V_{j-1} \equiv a_i \pmod{p_i}$ for all $i < j$.; For each iteration j, the coefficient $x_j$ is uniquely determined in the range $[0, p_j - 1]$.
//   • Tips: Ensure all moduli are pairwise coprime for a unique solution.; Precompute modular inverses for efficiency, especially if many are needed.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating modular inverses, leading to wrong coefficients.; Not handling large intermediate products, which can cause integer overflow.
// - Chinese Remainder Theorem (number, recursion, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: When you need to find a unique integer solution that satisfies a system of linear congruences with pairwise coprime moduli. It is used to reconstruct a number from its remainders modulo several divisors.
//   • Idea: The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) finds a unique solution x modulo the product of several pairwise coprime moduli, given a system of congruences. It typically involves computing modular inverses and combining solutions, with a complexity often dominated by modular exponentiation or extended Euclidean algorithm, usually O(N log M) or O(N log(max_modulus)).
//   • Invariants: The current combined solution 'x' satisfies 'x % m_i == a_i' for all congruences '(a_i, m_i)' processed so far.; The current combined modulus 'M' is the product of all individual moduli processed so far.
//   • Tips: Ensure all moduli are pairwise coprime for a unique solution.; Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find modular inverses.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if moduli are pairwise coprime.; Incorrectly calculating modular inverses.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
