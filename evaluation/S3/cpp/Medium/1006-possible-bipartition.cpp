// Problem Description:
// We want to split a group of n people (labeled from 1 to n) into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.
//
// Given the integer n and the array dislikes where dislikes[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that the person labeled ai does not like the person labeled bi, return true if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: The first group has [1,4], and the second group has [2,3].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 2000
// 	0 <= dislikes.length <= 104
// 	dislikes[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= ai < bi <= n
// 	All the pairs of dislikes are unique.

// - Check whether a graph is bipartite (graph, queue, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to determine if an undirected graph can be divided into two independent sets such that all edges connect vertices from different sets, or if it is two-colorable.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines if an undirected graph is bipartite by attempting to 2-color it using BFS. It assigns alternating colors (or sets) to adjacent vertices, detecting non-bipartite conditions if an edge connects two vertices of the same color.
//   • Invariants: All visited vertices within the current BFS component are correctly 2-colored.; All edges processed so far connect vertices of different colors.
//   • Tips: Use two distinct colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to represent the two sets.; Iterate through all vertices and start a new BFS from any unvisited vertex to handle disconnected components.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected graphs by ensuring all vertices are visited.; Incorrectly assigning colors, leading to false positives or negatives.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, array, dijkstra, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum costs without a full priority queue.
//   • Idea: A specialized Breadth-First Search variant that finds shortest paths in graphs with only 0 or 1 edge weights. It uses a deque to process 0-weight edges before 1-weight edges, achieving O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the deque have a distance value of either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.; Nodes pushed to the front of the deque always have a distance equal to the current node's distance.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque to maintain the order of processing nodes.; Add nodes reached via 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a standard queue instead of a deque.; Failing to initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the source.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, queue, array, multi-source-bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or when exploring all reachable nodes layer by layer from one or more starting points. It's ideal for problems requiring minimum steps or level-order processing.
//   • Idea: Multi-source BFS explores a graph layer by layer, starting from multiple initial nodes simultaneously, to find the shortest path (in terms of edges) to all reachable nodes. It operates in O(V + E) time and O(V) space for adjacency list representation.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same distance from one of the source nodes.; Every node added to the queue has been marked as visited.
//   • Tips: Initialize distances for all source nodes to zero and add them to the queue.; Mark nodes as visited immediately upon adding them to the queue to prevent redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.; Incorrectly initializing distances or the queue for multiple sources.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
