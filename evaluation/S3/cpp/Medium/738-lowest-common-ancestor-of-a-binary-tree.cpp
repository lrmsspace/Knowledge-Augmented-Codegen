//
// Problem Description:
// Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
//
// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
// 	-109 <= Node.val <= 109
// 	All Node.val are unique.
// 	p != q
// 	p and q will exist in the tree.

// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (array, min-window)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree efficiently for multiple queries. This approach is ideal when the tree is static and preprocessing is acceptable.
//   • Idea: This method finds the LCA by converting the problem into a Range Minimum Query on an Euler tour of the tree's depths. It preprocesses the tree in O(N log N) or O(N) time and answers queries in O(log N) or O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour array correctly records nodes in DFS entry/exit order.; The depth array stores the correct depth for each node in the Euler tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a DFS to construct the Euler tour and depth array.; Store the first occurrence index of each node in the Euler tour.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly constructing the Euler tour or depth array.; Off-by-one errors when mapping Euler tour indices to original nodes.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Tarjan's off-line algorithm (tree, ds, dfs, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Lowest Common Ancestor for multiple pairs of nodes in a tree, and all queries are known beforehand. It's an efficient offline approach for batch processing LCA queries.
//   • Idea: Tarjan's offline LCA algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal combined with a Union-Find data structure to answer all LCA queries efficiently. It processes N nodes and Q queries in O(N + Q * alpha(N)) time, where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.
//   • Invariants: After visiting a node 'u' and all its children, 'u' is marked as visited.; For any node 'v' whose subtree has been fully processed, 'find_set(v)' returns the representative of 'v''s component.
//   • Tips: Mark nodes as visited during DFS to track processed subtrees.; Use Union-Find's union operation to merge child subtrees with their parent after processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited, leading to incorrect LCA identification.; Incorrectly updating the 'ancestor' array or 'find_set' logic in Union-Find.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
