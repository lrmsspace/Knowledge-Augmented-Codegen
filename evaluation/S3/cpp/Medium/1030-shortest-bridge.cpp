// Problem Description:
// You are given an n x n binary matrix grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
//
// An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1's not connected to any other 1's. There are exactly two islands in grid.
//
// You may change 0's to 1's to connect the two islands to form one island.
//
// Return the smallest number of 0's you must flip to connect the two islands.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
// Output: 1
//
// Constraints:
// n == grid.length == grid[i].length
// 	2 <= n <= 100
// 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
// 	There are exactly two islands in grid.

// - 0-1 BFS (graph, queue, 01-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding shortest paths in a graph where edge weights are restricted to only 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum distances from a source to all reachable nodes, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
//   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds shortest paths from a single source in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It achieves this in O(V + E) time complexity by using a deque to prioritize 0-weight edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes in the deque have a distance value less than or equal to any node not yet processed.; Nodes added to the front of the deque (0-weight edges) always have a distance equal to the node they came from.
//   • Tips: Use a deque to maintain order: 0-weight edges go to front, 1-weight edges to back.; Initialize distances to infinity and source distance to 0.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update distances for 0-weight edges before adding to deque front.; Incorrectly handling visited states, leading to TLE or incorrect paths.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, array, dijkstra, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum costs without a full priority queue.
//   • Idea: A specialized Breadth-First Search variant that finds shortest paths in graphs with only 0 or 1 edge weights. It uses a deque to process 0-weight edges before 1-weight edges, achieving O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the deque have a distance value of either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.; Nodes pushed to the front of the deque always have a distance equal to the current node's distance.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque to maintain the order of processing nodes.; Add nodes reached via 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a standard queue instead of a deque.; Failing to initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the source.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, deque, 01-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently computes single-source shortest paths, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
//   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds the single-source shortest paths in a graph where all edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1. It uses a deque to process nodes, achieving an optimal time complexity of O(V + E).
//   • Invariants: When a node 'u' is extracted from the front of the deque, 'dist[u]' is its shortest path from the source.; The deque always contains nodes whose distances are either 'D' or 'D+1', where 'D' is the distance of the last node extracted.
//   • Tips: Always push 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Push 1-weight edges to the back of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Pushing 0-weight edges to the back or 1-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Not correctly initializing distances or the source node.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
