// Problem Description:
// A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
//
// Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string startGene to a gene string endGene where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.
//
//
// 	For example, "AACCGGTT" --> "AACCGGTA" is one mutation.
//
//
// There is also a gene bank bank that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in bank to make it a valid gene string.
//
// Given the two gene strings startGene and endGene and the gene bank bank, return the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from startGene to endGene. If there is no such a mutation, return -1.
//
// Note that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.
//
// Example:
// Input: startGene = "AACCGGTT", endGene = "AACCGGTA", bank = ["AACCGGTA"]
// Output: 1
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= bank.length <= 10
// 	startGene.length == endGene.length == bank[i].length == 8
// 	startGene, endGene, and bank[i] consist of only the characters ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'].

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compare strings or substrings quickly, reducing comparison time from linear to constant. It is ideal for problems requiring frequent string equality checks or pattern matching across large texts.
//   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to an integer hash value, allowing for O(1) equality checks between strings or substrings. This technique relies on a hash function where equal strings must produce equal hashes, though the reverse is not guaranteed.
//   • Invariants: The hash of any prefix s[0...i] is correctly computed based on s[0...i-1] and s[i].; All characters processed up to the current index i contribute to the current hash value.
//   • Tips: Use a polynomial rolling hash function with a prime base and a large prime modulus.; Employ double hashing (two different bases/moduli) to significantly reduce collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions: Different strings can produce the same hash, leading to false positives if not handled.; Poor choice of base or modulus can lead to more frequent collisions.
// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
