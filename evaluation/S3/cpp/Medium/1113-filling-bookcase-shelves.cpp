//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array books where books[i] = [thicknessi, heighti] indicates the thickness and height of the ith book. You are also given an integer shelfWidth.
//
// We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have a total width shelfWidth.
//
// We choose some of the books to place on this shelf such that the sum of their thickness is less than or equal to shelfWidth, then build another level of the shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down. We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.
//
// Note that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.
//
//
// 	For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.
//
//
// Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.
//
// Example:
// Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelfWidth = 4
// Output: 6
// Explanation:
// The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
// Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= books.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= thicknessi <= shelfWidth <= 1000
// 	1 <= heighti <= 1000

// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
//   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
// - Range Minimum Query (array, sparse-table)
//   • When to use: When performing many range minimum queries on a static array, especially when query time needs to be logarithmic after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes minimums for all possible ranges of power-of-two lengths, allowing O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing. It efficiently answers range minimum queries on an immutable array.
//   • Invariants: For any `j`, `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum value in the segment starting at `i` with length `2^j`.; The `log_table[k]` stores `floor(log2(k))` for efficient length calculation.
//   • Tips: Precompute log values or use `std::log2` for efficient length calculations.; The `dp[i][j]` entry stores the minimum in the range `[i, i + 2^j - 1]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to the array elements; it's for static data only.; Higher memory consumption compared to some other range query structures.
// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem involves finding an optimal value for a contiguous range of elements, and solutions for larger ranges can be derived by merging optimal solutions of smaller sub-ranges.
//   • Idea: An extension of dynamic programming where subproblems are defined over contiguous intervals, solving for dp[i][j] by iterating through all possible split points k within [i, j]. This often results in O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i][j] represents the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; When computing dp[i][j], all subproblems dp[x][y] where y - x + 1 < j - i + 1 are already solved.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.; Incorrect iteration order, leading to uncomputed subproblems.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
