//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string word.
//
// Return the maximum number of non-intersecting substrings of word that are at least four characters long and start and end with the same letter.
//
// Example:
// Input: word = "abcdeafdef"
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
// The two substrings are "abcdea" and "fdef".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= word.length <= 2 * 105
// 	word consists only of lowercase English letters.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Suffix Automaton (string, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently represent all substrings of a given string and perform various string operations like counting distinct substrings or pattern matching in linear time.
//   • Idea: A Suffix Automaton is a minimal finite automaton that accepts all suffixes of a given string. It implicitly represents all substrings and can be constructed in linear time, O(N) where N is the string length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the initial state spells a substring of the original string.; Each state represents a set of substrings that share the same end positions in the original string.
//   • Tips: Understand the concept of `endpos` sets and how they define states.; The number of states and transitions in a suffix automaton is linear with respect to string length.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm can be complex and prone to off-by-one errors or incorrect link updates.; Debugging state transitions and suffix links requires careful attention.
// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
