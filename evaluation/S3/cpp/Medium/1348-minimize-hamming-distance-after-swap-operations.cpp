// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-hamming-distance-after-swap-operations/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two integer arrays, source and target, both of length n. You are also given an array allowedSwaps where each allowedSwaps[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you are allowed to swap the elements at index ai and index bi (0-indexed) of array source. Note that you can swap elements at a specific pair of indices multiple times and in any order.
//
// The Hamming distance of two arrays of the same length, source and target, is the number of positions where the elements are different. Formally, it is the number of indices i for 0 <= i <= n-1 where source[i] != target[i] (0-indexed).
//
// Return the minimum Hamming distance of source and target after performing any amount of swap operations on array source.
//
// Example:
// Input: source = [1,2,3,4], target = [2,1,4,5], allowedSwaps = [[0,1],[2,3]]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: source can be transformed the following way:
// - Swap indices 0 and 1: source = [2,1,3,4]
// - Swap indices 2 and 3: source = [2,1,4,3]
// The Hamming distance of source and target is 1 as they differ in 1 position: index 3.
//
// Constraints:
// n == source.length == target.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= source[i], target[i] <= 105
// 	0 <= allowedSwaps.length <= 105
// 	allowedSwaps[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
// 	ai != bi

// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, linked-list, union-find, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and perform union operations to merge sets or find the representative of an element's set efficiently. It's suitable for problems involving dynamic connectivity or grouping elements.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: finding the representative of an element's set and merging two sets. It achieves nearly constant time complexity for these operations with path compression and union by rank/size optimizations.
//   • Invariants: Every element `i` belongs to exactly one set, represented by `find(i)`.; If `parent[i] == i`, then `i` is the representative (root) of its set.
//   • Tips: Implement path compression in `find` for optimal performance.; Use union by size or rank to maintain balanced trees.
//   • Pitfalls: Omitting path compression or union by rank/size can degrade performance to O(N).; Failing to correctly update auxiliary data stored at representatives during a union operation.
// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, tree, array, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and efficiently perform union operations to merge sets or find the representative of an element's set.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: finding the representative of an element's set and merging two sets. With path compression and union by rank/size, these operations achieve nearly constant amortized time complexity, O(alpha(N)).
//   • Invariants: Each element `v` is either a root (parent[v] == v) or has a parent pointer to another element in its set.; The `find_set` operation, after path compression, ensures that all nodes on the path from `v` to its root directly point to the root.
//   • Tips: Implement path compression in `find_set` for optimal performance.; Use union by rank or union by size to keep trees flat and balanced.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting path compression or union by rank/size leads to O(N) worst-case operations.; Incorrectly merging sets by only updating one root without considering the other's rank/size.
// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, tree, array, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently manage a collection of disjoint sets, supporting operations to merge sets and determine if two elements belong to the same set.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that maintains a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: union (merging two sets) and find (determining the representative of an element's set). With path compression and union by rank/size, operations achieve nearly O(1) amortized time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any element `v`, `parent[v]` is either `v` itself (if `v` is a root) or an ancestor of `v`.; All elements belonging to the same set share a common root representative.
//   • Tips: Apply path compression during `find_set` to optimize future queries.; Utilize union by rank or size to maintain balanced trees.
//   • Pitfalls: Omitting path compression or union by rank/size results in poor performance.; Failing to correctly identify the root of a set in `find_set`.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
