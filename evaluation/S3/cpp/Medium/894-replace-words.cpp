// Problem Description:
// In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful", we can form a derivative "helpful".
//
// Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.
//
// Return the sentence after the replacement.
//
// Example:
// Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
// Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100
// 	dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters.
// 	1 <= sentence.length <= 106
// 	sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
// 	The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
// 	The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
// 	Every two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space.
// 	sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.

// - Tries (trie, tree, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing a collection of strings and requiring efficient prefix-based operations like search, insertion, deletion, or finding the longest common prefix.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where nodes represent characters and paths from the root represent strings. Operations like insertion, search, and deletion typically take O(L) time, where L is the length of the key.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node's children pointers correspond to the next character in a string.
//   • Tips: Mark nodes as 'end of word' to distinguish prefixes from complete words.; Use an array for children pointers if the alphabet size is small and fixed (e.g., ASCII).
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or very deep tries due to many empty child pointers.; Deletion can be complex, requiring careful handling of nodes that are part of other words.
// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.
// - Tries (trie, array, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing string keys in a symbol table and needing efficient prefix, wildcard, or longest prefix matching operations, offering flexibility beyond binary search trees and speed comparable to hashing.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where keys are typically strings. It allows for efficient retrieval of keys based on their prefixes, achieving O(L) time complexity for operations, where L is the key length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node exists only if it is part of at least one stored key.
//   • Tips: Choose an appropriate branching factor (R) based on the alphabet size.; Represent children using arrays for fixed alphabets or hash maps for sparse ones.
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or sparse data.; Deletion of keys can be complex, requiring careful handling of empty branches.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
