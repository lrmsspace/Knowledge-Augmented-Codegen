// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-collect-all-apples-in-a-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.
//
// The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi. Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple, where hasApple[i] = true means that vertex i has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
// Output: 8 
// Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ai < bi <= n - 1
// 	hasApple.length == n

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Tarjan's off-line algorithm (tree, ds, dfs, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Lowest Common Ancestor for multiple pairs of nodes in a tree, and all queries are known beforehand. It's an efficient offline approach for batch processing LCA queries.
//   • Idea: Tarjan's offline LCA algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal combined with a Union-Find data structure to answer all LCA queries efficiently. It processes N nodes and Q queries in O(N + Q * alpha(N)) time, where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.
//   • Invariants: After visiting a node 'u' and all its children, 'u' is marked as visited.; For any node 'v' whose subtree has been fully processed, 'find_set(v)' returns the representative of 'v''s component.
//   • Tips: Mark nodes as visited during DFS to track processed subtrees.; Use Union-Find's union operation to merge child subtrees with their parent after processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited, leading to incorrect LCA identification.; Incorrectly updating the 'ancestor' array or 'find_set' logic in Union-Find.
// - Finding bridges in a graph in O(N+M) (graph, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm when you need to identify edges whose removal would increase the number of connected components in an undirected graph. It's suitable for analyzing network robustness or critical connections.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses Depth First Search (DFS) to find bridges in an undirected graph by tracking discovery times and the lowest reachable discovery time from a node or its descendants. It operates in linear time, O(N+M), where N is the number of vertices and M is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` currently in the DFS stack, `tin[u]` is its unique discovery time.; For any node `u` and its child `v` in the DFS tree, `low[v]` represents the earliest discovery time reachable from `v`'s subtree (including `v`) using at most one back-edge.
//   • Tips: Initialize discovery times (tin) and lowest reachable times (low) arrays, along with a visited array.; Pass the parent vertex to the DFS function to avoid treating the parent edge as a back-edge.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to pass the parent node or incorrectly handling the parent edge, leading to false bridge detections.; Failing to initialize `low` values correctly, especially for leaf nodes or isolated components.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use standard C++ only; do NOT rely on non-standard extensions or platform-specific APIs.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: Prefer modern standard C++ (C++11/14/17) features that are portable; avoid compiler-specific extensions (e.g., __int128 unless necessary and supported).
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
