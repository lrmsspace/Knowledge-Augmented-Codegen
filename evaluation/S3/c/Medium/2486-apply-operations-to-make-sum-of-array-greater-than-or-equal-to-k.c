// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-make-sum-of-array-greater-than-or-equal-to-k/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a positive integer k. Initially, you have an array nums = [1].
//
// You can perform any of the following operations on the array any number of times (possibly zero):
//
//
// 	Choose any element in the array and increase its value by 1.
// 	Duplicate any element in the array and add it to the end of the array.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of elements of the final array greater than or equal to k.
//
// Example:
// Input: k = 11
//
// Output: 5
//
// Explanation:
//
// We can do the following operations on the array nums = [1]:
//
//
// 	Increase the element by 1 three times. The resulting array is nums = [4].
// 	Duplicate the element two times. The resulting array is nums = [4,4,4].
//
//
// The sum of the final array is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 which is greater than or equal to k = 11.
// The total number of operations performed is 3 + 2 = 5.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= k <= 105
//

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// -  
// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent range queries and point/range updates are needed on an array, offering a balanced O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations. It's a good alternative when a segment tree is too complex or overkill.
//   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and updates. It achieves an O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both query and update operations.
//   • Invariants: Each block maintains an up-to-date aggregate of its elements.; For any query, fully contained blocks are processed using their precomputed aggregates.
//   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for optimal balance.; Precompute block aggregates (sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling partial blocks or boundary conditions.; Off-by-one errors in block indices or element indices within blocks.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
