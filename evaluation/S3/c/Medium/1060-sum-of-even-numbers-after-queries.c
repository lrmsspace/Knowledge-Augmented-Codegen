//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums and an array queries where queries[i] = [vali, indexi].
//
// For each query i, first, apply nums[indexi] = nums[indexi] + vali, then print the sum of the even values of nums.
//
// Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
// Output: [8,6,2,4]
// Explanation: At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
// After adding 1 to nums[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
// After adding -3 to nums[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
// After adding -4 to nums[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
// After adding 2 to nums[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 104
// 	-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 104
// 	-104 <= vali <= 104
// 	0 <= indexi < nums.length

// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - Integration by Simpson's formula (number, interval, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when approximating definite integrals of functions that are sufficiently smooth over a given interval. It is effective for achieving good accuracy with a moderate number of subintervals.
//   • Idea: Simpson's formula approximates a definite integral by dividing the integration interval into an even number of subintervals and approximating the function over each pair of subintervals with a parabola. This method offers a higher order of accuracy compared to simpler rules, typically achieving O(N^4) accuracy for N subintervals.
//   • Invariants: The sum accumulates weighted function values for all processed subintervals.; The subinterval width 'h' remains constant across the entire integration range.
//   • Tips: Ensure the total number of subintervals (2n) is always even for the composite rule.; The weights for function evaluations follow a specific 1-4-2-4-...-2-4-1 pattern.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the weighting coefficients, especially at the boundaries or interior points.; Using an odd number of subintervals, which invalidates the parabolic approximation for the composite rule.
// - Calculating the determinant using Kraut method in O(N^3) (matrix, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this method to compute the determinant of a square matrix efficiently by decomposing it into lower and upper triangular matrices. It is suitable for problems requiring O(N^3) complexity for matrix operations.
//   • Idea: The Kraut method computes the determinant of a square matrix by first decomposing it into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U), such that A = LU. The determinant is then the product of the diagonal elements of L and U, achieving O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After processing column k, the first k columns of L and first k rows of U are correctly computed.; For any i <= k and j <= k, the partial sum for A[i][j] from L and U elements up to index min(i,j) is maintained.
//   • Tips: Ensure the input matrix is square for determinant calculation.; The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: Division by zero can occur if a pivot element is zero, requiring pivoting strategies.; Floating-point precision issues can accumulate, especially for large matrices.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
