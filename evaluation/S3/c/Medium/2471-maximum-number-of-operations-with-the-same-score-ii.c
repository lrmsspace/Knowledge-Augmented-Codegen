// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-operations-with-the-same-score-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers called nums, you can perform any of the following operation while nums contains at least 2 elements:
//
//
// 	Choose the first two elements of nums and delete them.
// 	Choose the last two elements of nums and delete them.
// 	Choose the first and the last elements of nums and delete them.
//
//
// The score of the operation is the sum of the deleted elements.
//
// Your task is to find the maximum number of operations that can be performed, such that all operations have the same score.
//
// Return the maximum number of operations possible that satisfy the condition mentioned above.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,2,1,2,3,4]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We perform the following operations:
// - Delete the first two elements, with score 3 + 2 = 5, nums = [1,2,3,4].
// - Delete the first and the last elements, with score 1 + 4 = 5, nums = [2,3].
// - Delete the first and the last elements, with score 2 + 3 = 5, nums = [].
// We are unable to perform any more operations as nums is empty.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 2000
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
//

// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: When counting numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based properties, or calculating a sum of such properties.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique used to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers within a given range, based on their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, processing digits from most significant to least significant, achieving a time complexity of O(log(N) * S * T) where S is sum/state range and T is tight constraint.
//   • Invariants: The `idx` parameter always represents the current digit position being processed, from most significant to least significant.; The `tight` boolean parameter accurately indicates if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's corresponding digit.
//   • Tips: Handle leading zeros carefully, often with a dedicated boolean state in the DP function.; Use a 'tight' or 'limit' boolean parameter to manage the upper bound constraint imposed by the original number.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint can lead to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to reset the memoization table for each new query or test case, especially in competitive programming.
// - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries, especially Range Minimum/Maximum Queries, on an immutable array very quickly. It is ideal for scenarios where the data does not change and query performance is critical.
//   • Idea: Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes answers for all range queries of power-of-two lengths. It allows O(1) query time for idempotent operations like Range Minimum/Maximum Queries on a static array, with O(N log N) precomputation.
//   • Invariants: st[k][i] holds the result for the segment starting at index i with length 2^k.; For any k > 0, st[k][i] combines the results of two adjacent segments of length 2^(k-1).
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values to find the largest power of two in O(1).; Best suited for idempotent operations like minimum, maximum, or GCD.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support array updates; any modification invalidates the structure.; Inefficient for non-idempotent operations like range sum or XOR in O(1).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
