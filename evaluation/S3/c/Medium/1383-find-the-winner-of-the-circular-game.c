// Problem Description:
// There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.
//
// The rules of the game are as follows:
//
//
// 	Start at the 1st friend.
// 	Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
// 	The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
// 	If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
// 	Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.
//
//
// Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5, k = 2
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Here are the steps of the game:
// 1) Start at friend 1.
// 2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.
// 3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
// 4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.
// 5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.
// 6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.
// 7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
// 8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.
// 9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= k <= n <= 500
//

// - Josephus Problem (number, simulation, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the survivor's position in a circular game where every k-th person is eliminated, especially for large N where direct simulation is too slow.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the position of the last remaining person in the Josephus problem by iteratively reducing the problem size using a recursive formula and modulo arithmetic. It achieves an optimized time complexity of O(k log n).
//   • Invariants: The number of remaining elements decreases in each recursive step.; The relative order of the remaining elements is preserved throughout the process.
//   • Tips: Handle the base case where n < k separately to avoid infinite loops or incorrect calculations.; Use 0-indexing for simpler modulo arithmetic in the recursive formulas.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling index shifts after elements are removed can lead to wrong results.; Forgetting the base case n < k can lead to infinite recursion or incorrect behavior.
// - Josephus Problem (number, dp-1d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used to determine the position of the last remaining person in a circle where every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains. It models sequential removal processes in a circular arrangement.
//   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the position of the survivor in a circle of N people, where every K-th person is eliminated. The standard solution uses a recursive relation or dynamic programming, typically achieving O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The result J(n, k) represents the survivor's original 0-indexed position among n people.; Each recursive step J(n, k) correctly transforms the result from J(n-1, k) based on the k-th elimination.
//   • Tips: Use 0-indexing for a simpler and more elegant recursive formula.; Establish the base case for N=1 (the survivor is always 0 or 1).
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when switching between 0-indexing and 1-indexing.; Incorrectly applying the modulo operator, especially with negative results in some languages.
// - Josephus Problem (number, recursion, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when simulating a circular elimination process with a fixed step size, especially when seeking the survivor's position. It's particularly efficient for specific step sizes like two.
//   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the last remaining position in a circular arrangement after elements are eliminated at fixed intervals. The recursive solution for a step size of two has a logarithmic time complexity, O(log N), due to its divide-and-conquer nature.
//   • Invariants: The number of participants N is always positive in each recursive subproblem.; The returned position is always within the valid range [0, current N-1] (or [1, current N]).
//   • Tips: Base cases are crucial for recursive solutions, typically for N=1.; Observe patterns for specific step sizes, especially k=2, which has a simpler formula.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when converting between 0-indexed and 1-indexed results.; Incorrectly applying the position 'shift' after elements are eliminated in subproblems.
