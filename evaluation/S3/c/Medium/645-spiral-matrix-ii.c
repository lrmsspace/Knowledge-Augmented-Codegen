// Problem Description:
// Given a positive integer n, generate an n x n matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3
// Output: [[1,2,3],[8,9,4],[7,6,5]]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 20
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to uniquely encode or decode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers, or to count the number of spanning trees for a complete graph. It's also useful for problems involving tree properties like degree sequences.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence representing a labeled tree, allowing conversion between a tree and a sequence of numbers. Its generation and decoding typically involve an iterative process of finding and removing leaves, achieving O(N log N) or O(N) complexity with optimized leaf finding.
//   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always has N-2 elements for an N-vertex tree.; Each vertex's degree is correctly maintained throughout the process.
//   • Tips: Maintain a degree array to efficiently find leaves.; Use a min-priority queue or a two-pointer approach for finding the smallest leaf.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in sequence length or vertex indexing.; Incorrectly handling the last two vertices during decoding.
// - Sieve of Eratosthenes (array, sieve, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit or precompute primality for a range. It is efficient for generating primes within a reasonable upper bound.
//   • Idea: The Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified integer by iteratively marking multiples of primes as composite. It achieves a time complexity of O(N log log N).
//   • Invariants: All numbers less than the current prime 'p' have already been processed.; If 'i' is marked as prime, then all its multiples less than 'i*i' have been marked composite by smaller primes.
//   • Tips: Optimize by starting inner loop from p*p, as smaller multiples would have been marked.; Use a boolean array for primality, or an integer array to store smallest prime factor (SPF).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0 and 1, which are neither prime nor composite.; Off-by-one errors when setting array bounds or loop conditions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
