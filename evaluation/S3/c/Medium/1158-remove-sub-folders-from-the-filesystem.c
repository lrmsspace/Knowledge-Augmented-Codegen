//
// Problem Description:
// Given a list of folders folder, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it. A sub-folder of folder[j] must start with folder[j], followed by a "/". For example, "/a/b" is a sub-folder of "/a", but "/b" is not a sub-folder of "/a/b/c".
//
// The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: '/' followed by one or more lowercase English letters.
//
//
// 	For example, "/leetcode" and "/leetcode/problems" are valid paths while an empty string and "/" are not.
//
// Example:
// Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
// Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
// Explanation: Folders "/a/b" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 104
// 	2 <= folder[i].length <= 100
// 	folder[i] contains only lowercase letters and '/'.
// 	folder[i] always starts with the character '/'.
// 	Each folder name is unique.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Suffix Array (string, array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query properties of all suffixes or substrings of a given text, especially for pattern matching or finding repeated structures. It is particularly useful for problems requiring lexicographical ordering of all suffixes.
//   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing their starting indices. It enables efficient string operations like pattern searching and finding longest common prefixes, typically constructed in O(N log N) time.
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, suffixes are sorted correctly up to a certain length (e.g., 2^k).; All suffixes of the original string are represented by their starting indices in the array.
//   • Tips: Append a unique sentinel character (e.g., '$') smaller than any other character to the string.; Utilize the LCP array, often built alongside, for advanced string queries and optimizations.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive sorting of suffixes by string comparison leads to an inefficient O(N^2 log N) complexity.; High memory usage for very long strings due to storing all suffixes implicitly or explicitly.
// - String Sorts (array, string, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to sort a collection of strings lexicographically, especially when string lengths vary or are large, and the character set is limited.
//   • Idea: This algorithm sorts an array of strings lexicographically by recursively applying a counting sort-like distribution based on characters from most significant to least significant digit. It typically achieves O(N*L + R*L) time complexity, where N is the number of strings, L is the average string length, and R is the radix size.
//   • Invariants: All strings in the current `a[lo...hi]` sub-array share a common prefix of length `d`.; After the distribution pass for character `d`, `aux` contains strings from `a[lo...hi]` stably sorted by their `d`-th character.
//   • Tips: Use an auxiliary array for stable distribution during each pass to maintain relative order.; Implement a cutoff to insertion sort for small sub-arrays to improve performance due to lower overhead.
//   • Pitfalls: Can have high overhead for small N or short strings compared to comparison sorts.; Potentially memory intensive due to the auxiliary array and recursion stack depth proportional to max string length.
// - String Sorts (array, string, number, radix-sort, recursion, counting-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting a large collection of strings or integers with a limited range of character/digit values. It is particularly efficient for fixed-length keys but can be adapted for variable lengths.
//   • Idea: Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits or characters which share the same significant position and value. It typically achieves O(N*W) time complexity, where N is the number of items and W is the key length.
//   • Invariants: After each pass `d`, the elements are stably sorted according to their digits up to position `d`.; The counting sort subroutine correctly places elements into their sorted positions for the current digit, preserving relative order.
//   • Tips: LSD (Least Significant Digit) is simpler for fixed-length keys.; MSD (Most Significant Digit) is better for variable-length keys or when keys are very long.
//   • Pitfalls: Not efficient for small N or very large W due to constant factors.; Requires extra space for auxiliary array and counting array.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
