// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-reach-last-room-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a dungeon with n x m rooms arranged as a grid.
//
// You are given a 2D array moveTime of size n x m, where moveTime[i][j] represents the minimum time in seconds when you can start moving to that room. You start from the room (0, 0) at time t = 0 and can move to an adjacent room. Moving between adjacent rooms takes one second for one move and two seconds for the next, alternating between the two.
//
// Return the minimum time to reach the room (n - 1, m - 1).
//
// Two rooms are adjacent if they share a common wall, either horizontally or vertically.
//
// Example:
// Input: moveTime = [[0,4],[4,4]]
//
// Output: 7
//
// Explanation:
//
// The minimum time required is 7 seconds.
//
//
// 	At time t == 4, move from room (0, 0) to room (1, 0) in one second.
// 	At time t == 5, move from room (1, 0) to room (1, 1) in two seconds.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n == moveTime.length <= 750
// 	2 <= m == moveTime[i].length <= 750
// 	0 <= moveTime[i][j] <= 109

// - Number of paths of fixed length / Shortest paths of fixed length (graph, simulation, counting, floyd-warshall)
//   • When to use: Use this approach when you need to count the number of paths or find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, specifically constrained to an exact number of edges or at most a certain number of edges.
//   • Idea: This technique leverages matrix exponentiation on an adjacency matrix to find paths of a fixed length k. For problems involving paths of length up to k, the graph is modified by duplicating vertices and adding specific edges.
//   • Invariants: After p matrix multiplications, M^p[i][j] represents the count/shortest path length between i and j using exactly p edges.; The modified graph for 'at most k' paths ensures a path of length m <= k in the original graph corresponds to a path of length k+1 in the new graph.
//   • Tips: For exactly K edges, compute the K-th power of the adjacency matrix.; For at most K edges, duplicate each vertex v to v' and add edges (v, v') and (v', v') with appropriate weights (1 for counting, 0 for shortest path).
//   • Pitfalls: Naive matrix multiplication is O(N^3), leading to high complexity for large N.; Incorrectly handling edge weights (e.g., for shortest paths) can lead to wrong results.
// - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the shortest paths between all possible pairs of vertices in a graph. It is particularly suitable for dense graphs or when negative edge weights are present, as long as no negative cycles are reachable.
//   • Idea: Floyd-Warshall is a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It iteratively considers all possible intermediate vertices to update path distances, achieving an O(V^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After the k-th iteration, dist[i][j] contains the shortest path from i to j considering only vertices 0 to k-1 as intermediate nodes.; For any pair (i, j), dist[i][j] is always greater than or equal to the true shortest path distance from i to j (or infinity if unreachable).
//   • Tips: Initialize distances: direct edge weights, infinity for no direct edge, zero for self-loops.; The outermost loop must iterate through intermediate vertices (k).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect loop order (k not outermost) leads to incorrect results.; Integer overflow with large path sums if not using appropriate data types.
// - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (graph, matrix, floyd-warshall, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, especially if negative edge weights are present but no negative cycles.
//   • Idea: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming approach that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It iteratively considers all possible intermediate vertices to update path lengths, achieving an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, d[i][j] stores the shortest path from i to j using only vertices {1, ..., k} as intermediate nodes.; d[i][j] always represents a valid path length or infinity, never an invalid negative value unless a negative cycle is detected.
//   • Tips: Initialize direct edge weights and infinity for non-existent edges.; Set distance from a vertex to itself to zero initially.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect loop order (k must be outermost) will yield incorrect results.; Improper handling of 'infinity' values can lead to overflow or incorrect comparisons.

// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.

// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
