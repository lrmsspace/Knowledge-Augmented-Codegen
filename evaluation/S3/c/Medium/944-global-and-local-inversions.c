//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums of length n which represents a permutation of all the integers in the range [0, n - 1].
//
// The number of global inversions is the number of the different pairs (i, j) where:
//
//
// 	0 <= i < j < n
// 	nums[i] > nums[j]
//
//
// The number of local inversions is the number of indices i where:
//
//
// 	0 <= i < n - 1
// 	nums[i] > nums[i + 1]
//
//
// Return true if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,0,2]
// Output: true
// Explanation: There is 1 global inversion and 1 local inversion.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= nums[i] < n
// 	All the integers of nums are unique.
// 	nums is a permutation of all the numbers in the range [0, n - 1].

// - Convex hull trick and Li Chao tree (array, number, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when the optimal solution for a subproblem depends only on solutions to smaller, contiguous subproblems. It's effective for optimizing sequential decision-making or finding optimal values in arrays.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming 1D solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results to avoid recomputation. It typically achieves O(N) or O(N log N) time and O(N) or O(1) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] correctly stores the optimal solution for the subproblem ending at index i.; All dp[j] for j < i have been computed and are correct.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the state: what does dp[i] represent for the subproblem?; Establish correct base cases for the smallest subproblems.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the state or recurrence relation.; Missing or incorrect base cases, leading to incorrect results.
// - interval-dp (array, interval-dp, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when finding an optimal value (min/max) for operations on contiguous subarrays or segments, especially when subproblems are defined by intervals and can be combined from smaller adjacent intervals. Useful for problems involving circular arrangements by duplicating the array.
//   • Idea: Interval DP is a dynamic programming technique that solves problems by breaking them into subproblems defined over contiguous intervals. It typically computes solutions for smaller intervals first, then uses these to build solutions for larger intervals, often with an O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any `len`, `dp[l][r]` for `r - l + 1 < len` are already computed.; `dp[l][r]` represents the optimal cost for the operation on the range `[l, r]`.
//   • Tips: Define dp[i][j] as the optimal solution for the interval [i, j].; Iterate by interval length first, then by start index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases for intervals of length 1.; Off-by-one errors in interval boundaries or split points.
// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, coordinate-compress, segment-tree, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements must be strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal substructure on sequences with an increasing property.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are in increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree with coordinate compression.
//   • Invariants: The `dp` array (or segment tree) stores information about the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The `dp` array, if used, remains sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) solution uses a `dp` array storing the smallest ending element for all increasing subsequences of a given length.; Binary search (`lower_bound`) efficiently finds the correct position to update in the `dp` array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates; LIS typically requires strictly increasing elements.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
