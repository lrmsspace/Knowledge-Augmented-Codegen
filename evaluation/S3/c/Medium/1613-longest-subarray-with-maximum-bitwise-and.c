// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-with-maximum-bitwise-and/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums of size n.
//
// Consider a non-empty subarray from nums that has the maximum possible bitwise AND.
//
//
// 	In other words, let k be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of any subarray of nums. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to k should be considered.
//
//
// Return the length of the longest such subarray.
//
// The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.
//
// A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,2,2]
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 3.
// The longest subarray with that value is [3,3], so we return 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 106

// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
// - Bit manipulation (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When problems involve manipulating individual bits of numbers, representing sets as bitmasks, or optimizing operations on powers of two. It is also useful for certain combinatorics and dynamic programming problems.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators. This technique is often used to optimize computations, manage boolean flags efficiently, or represent subsets, typically achieving O(1) complexity for fixed-size integers.
//   • Invariants: Each bit in the mask accurately reflects the inclusion or exclusion status of its corresponding element.; Bitwise operations maintain the integrity of unaffected bits.
//   • Tips: Use (1 << k) to create a mask with the k-th bit set.; n & (n-1) clears the least significant set bit.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect operator precedence can lead to subtle bugs.; Mixing signed and unsigned integers in bitwise operations can yield unexpected results.
// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to iterate through all possible submasks of a given bitmask efficiently, typically for problems involving subsets or combinations represented by bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks of a given bitmask in descending order using a clever bitwise trick. It processes each submask in O(1) time, leading to an overall complexity of O(2^k) where k is the number of set bits in the original mask.
//   • Invariants: Each `s` generated is a valid submask of the original mask `m`.; The value of `s` strictly decreases in each iteration until it reaches 0 (or the loop terminates).
//   • Tips: Always consider processing the submask 0 separately if it's a valid case for your problem.; The iteration naturally generates submasks in strictly descending numerical order.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting that the standard loop structure `for (int s = m; s > 0; s = (s - 1) & m)` omits submask 0.; Incorrectly assuming the iteration order is ascending; it is always descending.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
