// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/all-divisions-with-the-highest-score-of-a-binary-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed binary array nums of length n. nums can be divided at index i (where 0 <= i <= n) into two arrays (possibly empty) numsleft and numsright:
//
//
// 	numsleft has all the elements of nums between index 0 and i - 1 (inclusive), while numsright has all the elements of nums between index i and n - 1 (inclusive).
// 	If i == 0, numsleft is empty, while numsright has all the elements of nums.
// 	If i == n, numsleft has all the elements of nums, while numsright is empty.
//
//
// The division score of an index i is the sum of the number of 0's in numsleft and the number of 1's in numsright.
//
// Return all distinct indices that have the highest possible division score. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [0,0,1,0]
// Output: [2,4]
// Explanation: Division at index
// - 0: numsleft is []. numsright is [0,0,1,0]. The score is 0 + 1 = 1.
// - 1: numsleft is [0]. numsright is [0,1,0]. The score is 1 + 1 = 2.
// - 2: numsleft is [0,0]. numsright is [1,0]. The score is 2 + 1 = 3.
// - 3: numsleft is [0,0,1]. numsright is [0]. The score is 2 + 0 = 2.
// - 4: numsleft is [0,0,1,0]. numsright is []. The score is 3 + 0 = 3.
// Indices 2 and 4 both have the highest possible division score 3.
// Note the answer [4,2] would also be accepted.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
