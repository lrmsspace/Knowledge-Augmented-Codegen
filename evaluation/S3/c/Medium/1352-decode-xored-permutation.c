// Problem Description:
// There is an integer array perm that is a permutation of the first n positive integers, where n is always odd.
//
// It was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]. For example, if perm = [1,3,2], then encoded = [2,1].
//
// Given the encoded array, return the original array perm. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.
//
// Example:
// Input: encoded = [3,1]
// Output: [1,2,3]
// Explanation: If perm = [1,2,3], then encoded = [1 XOR 2,2 XOR 3] = [3,1]
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= n < 105
// 	n is odd.
// 	encoded.length == n - 1

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Gray code (number, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when a sequence of binary numbers is needed where successive values differ by only one bit. This is useful for error detection in digital systems or position encoders.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit position. Conversion from a binary number `n` to its Gray code `G(n)` is `n ^ (n >> 1)`, and the inverse operation can also be performed efficiently in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: For binary to Gray: The resulting Gray code `G(n)` differs from `n` by exactly one bit for each `n`.; For inverse Gray to binary: The variable `n` accumulates the correct binary value from MSB to LSB.
//   • Tips: Understand the core `n ^ (n >> 1)` transformation for binary to Gray.; The inverse Gray code conversion involves iteratively XORing with right-shifted values.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation.; Incorrectly implementing the iterative inverse transformation logic.
// - Sprague-Grundy theorem. Nim (array, number, game-theory, prefix-xor)
//   • When to use: Use when analyzing impartial games with perfect information and no draws, especially to determine winning/losing states or to find a winning strategy. It's particularly useful for games that can be reduced to Nim.
//   • Idea: The Sprague-Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a Nim pile of a certain size (its nim-value or grundy number). For Nim, a position is a winning position if and only if the XOR sum of all pile sizes is non-zero, allowing for O(N) classification.
//   • Invariants: The XOR sum of the pile sizes (nim-sum) represents the game's current nim-value.; If the nim-sum is zero, any valid move will result in a non-zero nim-sum for the opponent.
//   • Tips: Understand the definition of impartial games and their properties.; Calculate the XOR sum of game components to determine the nim-sum.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing impartial games with partisan games where players have different moves.; Incorrectly calculating the XOR sum, leading to wrong state classifications.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
