// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
//
//
// struct Node {
//   int val;
//   Node *left;
//   Node *right;
//   Node *next;
// }
//
//
// Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
//
// Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
// Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
// Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 212 - 1].
// 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
//
//
//  
// Follow-up:
//
//
// 	You may only use constant extra space.
// 	The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, binary-lifting, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use binary lifting when you need to answer multiple Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries or ancestor relationship checks efficiently on a static tree.
//   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestor pointers using DFS to answer Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries and ancestor checks in O(log N) time per query, after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: For any node `u` and power `k`, `up[u][k]` is the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; `depth[u]` correctly represents the distance from the root to node `u`.
//   • Tips: Precompute `up[u][k]` as the 2^k-th ancestor of `u`.; Use DFS to fill the `up` array and node depths.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating `log N` for array dimensions.; Failing to handle the root node's ancestors (e.g., `up[root][k]` should be itself or an invalid node).
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Lifting (tree, array, dfs, binary-lifting)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the lowest common ancestor of multiple pairs of nodes in a static tree efficiently. It's suitable for scenarios requiring fast query times after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: Binary lifting precomputes ancestors at powers of two distances for each node, enabling O(log N) LCA queries after O(N log N) preprocessing. It finds the LCA by lifting nodes to the same depth and then simultaneously upwards.
//   • Invariants: `up[u][j]` stores the `2^j`-th ancestor of node `u`.; For any node `u`, `depth[u]` is its distance from the root.
//   • Tips: Precompute depths of all nodes using DFS from the root.; Initialize `up[u][0]` as the direct parent of `u` for all nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the root's parent or depth calculation.; Off-by-one errors in `logN` calculation for array dimensions.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Farach-Colton and Bender Algorithm (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: When frequent LCA queries are needed on a static tree, and optimal query time is critical. It's suitable for scenarios requiring O(1) query time after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a tree by reducing the problem to Range Minimum Query (RMQ) on an Euler tour. It preprocesses the tree in O(N) time using DFS to build an array of nodes and their depths, then answers LCA queries in O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour array contains every edge traversed twice, and each node appears at least once.; The depth array stores the correct distance from the root for each node's occurrence in the Euler tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a DFS to construct the Euler tour and depth array.; Store both the node identifier and its depth during the Euler tour.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the start and end indices for the RMQ on the Euler tour.; Off-by-one errors when mapping Euler tour indices to original nodes or depths.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
