// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.
//
// Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 2000
// 	-106 <= nums[i] <= 106
// 	The answer is guaranteed to fit inside a 32-bit integer.
//

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, counting, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Use when seeking the longest possible sequence of elements from a given array such that each element is greater than the preceding one, preserving their original relative order.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem identifies the longest possible subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order, preserving their original relative positions. It can be solved efficiently in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree.
//   • Invariants: The `tails` array elements are always strictly increasing.; For any index `k`, `tails[k]` holds the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `k+1`.
//   • Tips: Use a `tails` array to store the smallest ending element for LIS of each length.; Employ binary search on the `tails` array to update or extend subsequences.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence (relative order) with contiguous subarray.; Incorrectly implementing strict vs. non-strict increasing conditions.
// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, coordinate-compress, segment-tree, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements must be strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal substructure on sequences with an increasing property.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are in increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree with coordinate compression.
//   • Invariants: The `dp` array (or segment tree) stores information about the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The `dp` array, if used, remains sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) solution uses a `dp` array storing the smallest ending element for all increasing subsequences of a given length.; Binary search (`lower_bound`) efficiently finds the correct position to update in the `dp` array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates; LIS typically requires strictly increasing elements.
// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal ordering of non-contiguous elements.
//   • Idea: This DP approach calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in an array. It builds upon previously computed subsequence lengths, resulting in an O(N^2) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] stores the length of the LIS ending at index i.; For any j < i, if A[j] < A[i], then dp[j] + 1 is a candidate length for dp[i].
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element itself forms an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling the strict increasing condition (e.g., allowing equality).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
