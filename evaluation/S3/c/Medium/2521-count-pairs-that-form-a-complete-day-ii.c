//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array hours representing times in hours, return an integer denoting the number of pairs i, j where i < j and hours[i] + hours[j] forms a complete day.
//
// A complete day is defined as a time duration that is an exact multiple of 24 hours.
//
// For example, 1 day is 24 hours, 2 days is 48 hours, 3 days is 72 hours, and so on.
//
// Example:
// Input: hours = [12,12,30,24,24]
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation: The pairs of indices that form a complete day are (0, 1) and (3, 4).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= hours.length <= 5 * 105
// 	1 <= hours[i] <= 109

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Binomial Coefficients (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to calculate the number of ways to choose k items from n distinct items, often under modular constraints.
//   • Idea: Binomial coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n distinct items. They can be computed using Pascal's identity or factorials, with complexity varying based on the method and modulo requirements.
//   • Invariants: For Pascal's triangle, dp[i][j] stores C(i, j).; For factorial method, fact[i] stores i! % M.
//   • Tips: Use Pascal's triangle for small n and k values.; Precompute factorials and inverse factorials for larger n modulo a prime.
//   • Pitfalls: Overflow with large factorials if not using modular arithmetic.; Division by zero when computing inverse modulo if modulus is not prime.
// - Burnside's lemma / Pólya enumeration theorem (array, number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting the number of distinct configurations or arrangements of objects under a set of symmetry operations, where configurations are considered identical if one can be transformed into another by a group action.
//   • Idea: Burnside's Lemma and Pólya Enumeration Theorem are combinatorial tools used to count the number of distinct objects under a group of symmetries. Both typically involve iterating through group elements and analyzing permutation cycle structures, often resulting in polynomial time complexity depending on group size and element analysis.
//   • Invariants: The set of group elements considered remains consistent throughout the summation.; Each group element's cycle decomposition is correctly identified.
//   • Tips: Identify the group of symmetry operations acting on the objects.; For each group element, determine its permutation cycle structure.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the full set of distinct group operations.; Errors in determining the cycle structure of permutations.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
