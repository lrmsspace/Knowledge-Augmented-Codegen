// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
//
// A valid BST is defined as follows:
//
//
// 	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly less than the node's key.
// 	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly greater than the node's key.
// 	Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [2,1,3]
// Output: true
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// 	-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to store ordered data that allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion while maintaining sorted order. It's suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(log N) average time and O(N) worst-case.
//   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than its key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than its key.
//   • Tips: Maintain the BST property: left child < parent < right child.; Recursion simplifies many operations like search, insert, and traversal.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade performance to O(N) for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can break BST properties or lead to data loss.
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Sqrt Tree (array, tree, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to perform O(1) range queries and support efficient updates (single element or range) on an array, leveraging a hierarchical decomposition.
//   • Idea: A Sqrt Tree is a data structure that supports O(1) range queries and efficient updates on an array. It recursively decomposes the array into blocks and layers, using precomputed information and bitwise operations to quickly answer queries and propagate updates.
//   • Invariants: Each element is part of exactly one block at each layer of the Sqrt Tree.; The highest differing bit between `l` and `r` identifies the specific layer for processing `q(l, r)`.
//   • Tips: Precompute highest bit for efficient layer selection.; Decompose queries into intra-block and inter-block segments.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive updates can result in O(N) complexity per update.; High memory consumption due to multiple layers of precomputed arrays.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
