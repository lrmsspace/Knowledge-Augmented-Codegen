// Problem Description:
// A parentheses string is a non-empty string consisting only of '(' and ')'. It is valid if any of the following conditions is true:
//
//
// 	It is ().
// 	It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid parentheses strings.
// 	It can be written as (A), where A is a valid parentheses string.
//
//
// You are given a parentheses string s and a string locked, both of length n. locked is a binary string consisting only of '0's and '1's. For each index i of locked,
//
//
// 	If locked[i] is '1', you cannot change s[i].
// 	But if locked[i] is '0', you can change s[i] to either '(' or ')'.
//
//
// Return true if you can make s a valid parentheses string. Otherwise, return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "))()))", locked = "010100"
// Output: true
// Explanation: locked[1] == '1' and locked[3] == '1', so we cannot change s[1] or s[3].
// We change s[0] and s[4] to '(' while leaving s[2] and s[5] unchanged to make s valid.
//
// Constraints:
// n == s.length == locked.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	s[i] is either '(' or ')'.
// 	locked[i] is either '0' or '1'.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this when verifying if a sequence of delimiters is correctly nested and balanced. It is also applicable for counting or generating all possible valid sequences of a given length.
//   • Idea: This algorithm involves checking if a sequence of opening and closing delimiters is properly matched and nested, or enumerating such sequences. Validation typically uses a stack in O(N) time, while generation often involves backtracking with O(Catalan(N)) complexity.
//   • Invariants: The stack contains only opening delimiters that are yet to be matched.; The balance counter (open - close) is never negative at any point during traversal.
//   • Tips: Use a stack to track unmatched opening delimiters for validation.; Maintain a balance counter (increment for open, decrement for close) for a simpler check.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if the stack is empty after processing the entire sequence.; Allowing a closing delimiter when no matching opening delimiter is available (empty stack or mismatch).
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the total number of valid arrangements of opening and closing brackets, ensuring all pairs are matched and correctly nested. It applies to combinatorial problems requiring structured pairing.
//   • Idea: This technique counts the number of ways to form sequences of opening and closing brackets such that they are balanced and properly nested. It is a classic combinatorial problem, typically solved in O(N) or O(N^2) time.
//   • Invariants: At any point in sequence construction, the count of open brackets placed must be greater than or equal to the count of closed brackets placed.; The total number of open brackets in a complete valid sequence must exactly equal the total number of closed brackets.
//   • Tips: Recognize the connection to Catalan numbers for common variations (e.g., N pairs of parentheses).; Dynamic programming can solve more complex variations with different bracket types or constraints.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the 'prefix sum' condition: the count of open brackets must always be greater than or equal to close brackets at any point.; Incorrectly applying Catalan numbers to problems with additional constraints or different bracket types.
// - Gray code (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
//   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
//   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
