// Problem Description:
// Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.
//
// The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.
//
// Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
//
// Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.
//
// Example:
// Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.
//
// Constraints:
// -231 <= dividend, divisor <= 231 - 1
// 	divisor != 0

// - Balanced Ternary (number, string, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when a number system is required that can represent both positive and negative integers symmetrically without an explicit sign bit, or for specific arithmetic properties.
//   • Idea: Balanced ternary is a non-standard positional numeral system using digits -1 (Z), 0, and 1. The conversion from decimal typically involves an intermediate standard ternary representation, then iteratively adjusting digits from least significant to most significant with carry operations, achieving O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All digits to the right of the current processing position are already in valid balanced ternary form (Z, 0, or 1).; The sum of the value represented by the processed digits and the value represented by the remaining digits (including current carry) equals the original number.
//   • Tips: First convert the decimal number to standard ternary (base 3).; Process digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to propagate carries correctly, especially when a '2' or '3' appears.; Incorrectly handling the sign of 'Z' (-1) during back-conversion to decimal.
// - Bit manipulation (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when operations on individual bits of an integer are required, for optimizing arithmetic with powers of two, or for efficient management of boolean flags.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators and shifts. These operations typically have O(1) time complexity as they are hardware-level instructions.
//   • Invariants: The total number of bits representing the integer remains constant for fixed-width types.; Applying `n & (1 << k)` isolates the k-th bit, setting all other bits to zero.
//   • Tips: Use `&` with `(1 << k)` to check if the k-th bit is set.; Use `|` with `(1 << k)` to set the k-th bit.
//   • Pitfalls: Be aware of integer overflow when performing large left shifts.; Understand the difference between arithmetic and logical right shifts, especially for signed numbers.
// - Extended Euclidean Algorithm (number, gcd, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find integer coefficients x and y that satisfy Bézout's identity (ax + by = gcd(a,b)). It is also essential for computing modular multiplicative inverses and solving linear Diophantine equations.
//   • Idea: The Extended Euclidean Algorithm computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers 'a' and 'b', and simultaneously finds integer coefficients 'x' and 'y' such that 'ax + by = gcd(a,b)'. It operates in O(log(min(a,b))) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: x * (initial a) + y * (initial b) = current_a_value; x_1 * (initial a) + y_1 * (initial b) = current_b_value
//   • Tips: Can be implemented using either a recursive or an iterative approach.; The algorithm correctly handles negative integer inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining base cases in recursive implementations can lead to errors.; Potential for integer overflow if coefficients x or y become extremely large, though uncommon.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
