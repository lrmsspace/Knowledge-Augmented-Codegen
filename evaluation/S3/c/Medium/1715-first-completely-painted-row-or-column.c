// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/first-completely-painted-row-or-column/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array arr, and an m x n integer matrix mat. arr and mat both contain all the integers in the range [1, m * n].
//
// Go through each index i in arr starting from index 0 and paint the cell in mat containing the integer arr[i].
//
// Return the smallest index i at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in mat.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [1,3,4,2], mat = [[1,4],[2,3]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The moves are shown in order, and both the first row and second column of the matrix become fully painted at arr[2].
//
// Constraints:
// m == mat.length
// 	n = mat[i].length
// 	arr.length == m * n
// 	1 <= m, n <= 105
// 	1 <= m * n <= 105
// 	1 <= arr[i], mat[r][c] <= m * n
// 	All the integers of arr are unique.
// 	All the integers of mat are unique.

// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when performing many range queries on a static array where the query operation is idempotent (e.g., min, max, GCD) to achieve O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
//   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths, allowing O(1) query time for idempotent operations like range minimum/maximum queries. Precomputation takes O(N log N) time and space.
//   • Invariants: The `st[k][i]` entry stores the result of the operation for the range `[i, i + 2^k - 1]`.; All ranges of length `2^k` starting at `i` are correctly computed in `st[k][i]` during precomputation.
//   • Tips: Precompute logarithms for O(1) lookup of `floor(log2(length))` during queries.; Sparse tables are most efficient for idempotent operations (min, max, GCD, OR, AND) due to overlapping segments.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for dynamic arrays or scenarios requiring updates, as modifications invalidate the precomputed table.; High memory usage: requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.
// - Sparse Table (array, sparse-table, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to perform many range queries on a static array, especially when the query operation is associative and idempotent, allowing for O(1) query time after O(N log N) precomputation.
//   • Idea: A Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries of power-of-two lengths. It allows O(1) query time for idempotent operations like min/max/gcd and O(log N) for non-idempotent associative operations, after an O(N log N) build time.
//   • Invariants: After precomputation, dp[k][i] stores the result for the range [i, i + 2^k - 1].; For any k > 0, dp[k][i] is the result of combining dp[k-1][i] and dp[k-1][i + 2^(k-1)].
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values for faster range length calculations.; Store dp[k][i] as the result for range [i, i + 2^k - 1].
//   • Pitfalls: Does not support updates to array elements efficiently.; Requires O(N log N) space, which can be significant for large N.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
