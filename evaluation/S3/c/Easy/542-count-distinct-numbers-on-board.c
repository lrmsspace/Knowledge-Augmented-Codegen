//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a positive integer n, that is initially placed on a board. Every day, for 109 days, you perform the following procedure:
//
//
// 	For each number x present on the board, find all numbers 1 <= i <= n such that x % i == 1.
// 	Then, place those numbers on the board.
//
//
// Return the number of distinct integers present on the board after 109 days have elapsed.
//
// Note:
//
//
// 	Once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.
// 	% stands for the modulo operation. For example, 14 % 3 is 2.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Initially, 5 is present on the board. 
// The next day, 2 and 4 will be added since 5 % 2 == 1 and 5 % 4 == 1. 
// After that day, 3 will be added to the board because 4 % 3 == 1. 
// At the end of a billion days, the distinct numbers on the board will be 2, 3, 4, and 5.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 100
//

// - 0-1 BFS (graph, array, dijkstra, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum costs without a full priority queue.
//   • Idea: A specialized Breadth-First Search variant that finds shortest paths in graphs with only 0 or 1 edge weights. It uses a deque to process 0-weight edges before 1-weight edges, achieving O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the deque have a distance value of either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.; Nodes pushed to the front of the deque always have a distance equal to the current node's distance.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque to maintain the order of processing nodes.; Add nodes reached via 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a standard queue instead of a deque.; Failing to initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the source.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, deque, array, 01-bfs)
//   • When to use: When finding the shortest path in a graph where edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1, or when minimizing operations where some operations are 'free' (cost 0) and others have a unit cost (cost 1).
//   • Idea: A graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source to all reachable nodes in a graph where edge weights are either 0 or 1. It uses a deque to prioritize 0-cost edges, achieving an optimal O(V + E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Nodes are added to the front of the deque if the edge weight is 0, and to the back if 1.; The distance `dist[u]` for any node `u` in the deque is either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.
//   • Tips: Use a deque: push 0-cost edges to the front, 1-cost edges to the back.; Mark nodes visited to avoid cycles and redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling visited states can lead to infinite loops or incorrect paths.; Forgetting to initialize distances properly before starting the traversal.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, deque, 01-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently computes single-source shortest paths, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
//   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds the single-source shortest paths in a graph where all edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1. It uses a deque to process nodes, achieving an optimal time complexity of O(V + E).
//   • Invariants: When a node 'u' is extracted from the front of the deque, 'dist[u]' is its shortest path from the source.; The deque always contains nodes whose distances are either 'D' or 'D+1', where 'D' is the distance of the last node extracted.
//   • Tips: Always push 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Push 1-weight edges to the back of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Pushing 0-weight edges to the back or 1-weight edges to the front of the deque.; Not correctly initializing distances or the source node.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

int distinctIntegers(int n) {
    // If n is 1, the only number on the board is 1 itself.
    if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    // For n > 1, the numbers that will be added to the board are all integers from 2 to n.
    // This is because for any x > 1, there will always be some i (1 < i <= n) such that x % i == 1.
    // Therefore, the distinct integers on the board after 10^9 days will be all integers from 2 to n, plus the initial integer n itself.
    return n - 1; // This counts all integers from 2 to n inclusive.
