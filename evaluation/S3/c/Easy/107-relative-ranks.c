// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the score of the ith athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.
//
// The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1st place athlete has the highest score, the 2nd place athlete has the 2nd highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:
//
//
// 	The 1st place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal".
// 	The 2nd place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal".
// 	The 3rd place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal".
// 	For the 4th place to the nth place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the xth place athlete's rank is "x").
//
//
// Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the rank of the ith athlete.
//
// Example:
// Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
// Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
// Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].
//
// Constraints:
// n == score.length
// 	1 <= n <= 104
// 	0 <= score[i] <= 106
// 	All the values in score are unique.

// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
// - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
//   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
//   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
//   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.
// - bucket-sort (array, bucket-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting elements with a known, uniform distribution over a specific range. It is efficient for numbers that are uniformly distributed across a range, often achieving linear time complexity.
//   • Idea: Bucket sort distributes elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates them. It can achieve O(N+K) average time complexity for uniformly distributed data.
//   • Invariants: After distributing elements, each element `x` is in bucket `floor(N * x)`.; After sorting buckets, every bucket `buckets[i]` contains its elements in sorted order.
//   • Tips: Choose the number of buckets appropriately based on data distribution and range.; Normalize input data to a [0, 1) range for simpler bucket indexing.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor performance with non-uniform data distribution, potentially degrading to O(N^2).; Requires extra space for the buckets, proportional to N+K.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
