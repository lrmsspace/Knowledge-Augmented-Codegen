// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-recolors-to-get-k-consecutive-black-blocks/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed string blocks of length n, where blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B', representing the color of the ith block. The characters 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white and black, respectively.
//
// You are also given an integer k, which is the desired number of consecutive black blocks.
//
// In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes a black block.
//
// Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least one occurrence of k consecutive black blocks.
//
// Example:
// Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
// so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
// It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
// Therefore, we return 3.
//
// Constraints:
// n == blocks.length
// 	1 <= n <= 100
// 	blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B'.
// 	1 <= k <= n

// - Z-function and its calculation (string, array, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a pattern within a text, or to identify repeated prefixes within a string efficiently.
//   • Idea: The Z-function computes an array where each element z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between the string and its suffix starting at index i. It runs in linear time, O(N), where N is the length of the string.
//   • Invariants: For all j < i, z[j] correctly stores the length of the longest common prefix between S and S[j...].; The segment [l, r-1] represents the rightmost segment that is a prefix of S and has been fully processed.
//   • Tips: Initialize z[0] to 0 (or N, depending on definition) and handle it as a base case.; Utilize previously computed Z-values to avoid redundant comparisons, especially within the 'rightmost matching segment' [l, r].
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating or using the 'rightmost matching segment' boundaries (l and r).; Off-by-one errors when calculating indices or lengths, especially with 0-based vs. 1-based indexing.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (ds, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently find the smallest non-negative integer not present in a dynamic sequence or range, supporting both updates and queries in logarithmic time.
//   • Idea: This technique finds the Minimal Excluded (MEX) value in a sequence by maintaining counts of distinct elements in ranges using a specialized data structure, typically a segment tree. It supports both updates and queries in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each segment tree node accurately reflects the count of distinct numbers within its corresponding range.; If a range [L, R) contains R-L distinct numbers, then all integers from L to R-1 are present.
//   • Tips: Implement a segment tree where each node stores the count of distinct numbers in its range.; The binary search for MEX checks if a range [0, k) contains k distinct numbers to decide which child to traverse.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating distinct counts in segment tree nodes, especially after updates.; Off-by-one errors when comparing the number of distinct elements with the expected count for a full range.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
