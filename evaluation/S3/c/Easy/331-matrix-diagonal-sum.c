// Problem Description:
// Given a square matrix mat, return the sum of the matrix diagonals.
//
// Only include the sum of all the elements on the primary diagonal and all the elements on the secondary diagonal that are not part of the primary diagonal.
//
// Example:
// Input: mat = [[1,2,3],
//               [4,5,6],
//               [7,8,9]]
// Output: 25
// Explanation: Diagonals sum: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
// Notice that element mat[1][1] = 5 is counted only once.
//
// Constraints:
// n == mat.length == mat[i].length
// 	1 <= n <= 100
// 	1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100

// - Calculating the determinant using Kraut method in O(N^3) (matrix, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use this method to compute the determinant of a square matrix efficiently by decomposing it into lower and upper triangular matrices. It is suitable for problems requiring O(N^3) complexity for matrix operations.
//   • Idea: The Kraut method computes the determinant of a square matrix by first decomposing it into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U), such that A = LU. The determinant is then the product of the diagonal elements of L and U, achieving O(N^3) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: After processing column k, the first k columns of L and first k rows of U are correctly computed.; For any i <= k and j <= k, the partial sum for A[i][j] from L and U elements up to index min(i,j) is maintained.
//   • Tips: Ensure the input matrix is square for determinant calculation.; The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements.
//   • Pitfalls: Division by zero can occur if a pivot element is zero, requiring pivoting strategies.; Floating-point precision issues can accumulate, especially for large matrices.
// - Calculating the determinant of a matrix by Gauss (matrix, number, simulation, counting)
//   • When to use: When needing to compute the determinant of a square matrix, especially when Gaussian elimination is a familiar or efficient approach. It is suitable for matrices where direct cofactor expansion is computationally too expensive.
//   • Idea: This algorithm computes the determinant of a square matrix by transforming it into an upper triangular form using Gaussian elimination. The determinant is the product of diagonal elements, adjusted by a sign factor from row swaps, with O(N^3) complexity.
//   • Invariants: Before processing column 'k', all elements A[i][j] where i > j and j < k are zero.; The determinant of the current matrix, multiplied by (-1)^swaps, equals the original matrix's determinant.
//   • Tips: Track the number of row swaps to correctly determine the determinant's sign.; Pivot selection can improve numerical stability, especially with floating-point numbers.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to adjust the sign after row exchanges.; Division by zero if a pivot element is zero, requiring a row swap.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
//   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
//   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

        if (i != matSize - 1 - i) { // Avoid double counting the center element in odd-sized matrices
            sum += mat[i][matSize - 1 - i]; // Secondary diagonal
        }
