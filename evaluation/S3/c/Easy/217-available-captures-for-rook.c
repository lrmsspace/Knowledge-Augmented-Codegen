//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an 8 x 8 matrix representing a chessboard. There is exactly one white rook represented by 'R', some number of white bishops 'B', and some number of black pawns 'p'. Empty squares are represented by '.'.
//
// A rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically (up, down, left, right) until it reaches another piece or the edge of the board. A rook is attacking a pawn if it can move to the pawn's square in one move.
//
// Note: A rook cannot move through other pieces, such as bishops or pawns. This means a rook cannot attack a pawn if there is another piece blocking the path.
//
// Return the number of pawns the white rook is attacking.
//
// Example:
// Input: board = [[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","R",".",".",".","p"],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."]]
//
// Output: 3
//
// Explanation:
//
// In this example, the rook is attacking all the pawns.
//
// Constraints:
// board.length == 8
// 	board[i].length == 8
// 	board[i][j] is either 'R', '.', 'B', or 'p'
// 	There is exactly one cell with board[i][j] == 'R'

// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, counting, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when counting non-attacking piece placements on a grid, especially when the problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems based on board properties like diagonals.
//   • Idea: This algorithm employs 2D dynamic programming to count the total number of ways to place non-attacking bishops on a chessboard. It leverages the independence of placements on black and white squares/diagonals, achieving a polynomial time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any diagonal `i`, `D[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonal `i`.; Bishops placed on black diagonals do not attack bishops placed on white diagonals.
//   • Tips: Decompose the problem into independent subproblems for black and white squares/diagonals.; Identify the state for DP, typically `dp[diagonal_index][bishops_placed]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the number of squares on each diagonal.; Overlapping bishops if diagonal definitions are not precise.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
//   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
//   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.
// - Finding the rank of a matrix (matrix, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to determine the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix. It's also applicable for understanding the dimension of the vector space spanned by the matrix's rows or columns.
//   • Idea: Determines the rank of a matrix by transforming it into row echelon form using Gaussian elimination. The rank is the number of non-zero rows in the echelon form, with a time complexity of O(N^3).
//   • Invariants: The number of non-zero rows processed so far equals the current rank.; All elements below the pivot in the current column are zeroed out.
//   • Tips: Always choose the largest absolute value pivot for numerical stability.; Swap rows to bring a non-zero element to the pivot position.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect zero checks.; Forgetting to increment rank only when a valid pivot is found.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
