//
// Problem Description:
// Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].
//
// Return the answer in an array.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
// Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
// Explanation: 
// For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
// For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
// For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
// For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
// For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 500
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 100
//

// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently calculate prefix sums or range sums on an array that undergoes frequent point updates. It is ideal for scenarios requiring both fast query and update operations on an array.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is an array-based data structure that efficiently calculates prefix sums and updates individual elements in an array. It supports both point updates and prefix sum queries in O(log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Each `T[i]` stores the sum of a specific range `[g(i), i]` from the original array.; The `sum(idx)` function correctly aggregates values from `A[0]` to `A[idx]`.
//   • Tips: Understand the bit manipulation (`i & -i`) for navigating parent/child relationships.; Consistently choose and apply either 0-based or 1-based indexing throughout the implementation.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling 0-based versus 1-based indexing can lead to off-by-one errors.; Forgetting to initialize the tree or performing updates incorrectly will yield wrong results.
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent point updates and range sum queries are needed on an array. It offers logarithmic time complexity for both operations, making it more efficient than a simple prefix sum array for dynamic data.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that efficiently calculates prefix sums and updates individual elements in an array. Both operations typically run in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each node `tree[i]` stores the sum of a specific range of elements ending at index `i`.; The length of the range summed by `tree[i]` is determined by `i & (-i)` (lowbit operation).
//   • Tips: Understand the lowbit operation and its role in navigating the tree structure.; Use 1-based indexing for simpler implementation of lowbit calculations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting 1-based indexing can lead to off-by-one errors and incorrect results.; Incorrectly implementing the lowbit calculation or update/query logic.
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Use when an array requires frequent point updates and efficient retrieval of prefix sums or range sums. It offers logarithmic time complexity for both operations.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that efficiently supports point updates and prefix sum queries on an array in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each `bit[i]` stores the sum of a contiguous range of elements from the original array.; The range length represented by `bit[i]` is determined by `i & -i` (the least significant bit).
//   • Tips: Use 1-based indexing for simpler bitwise operations (`i & -i`).; Initialize with an existing array in O(N) time using a linear construction method.
//   • Pitfalls: Directly finding range minimum/maximum is not efficient or generally supported.; Operations must be associative and preferably invertible for general range queries.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
