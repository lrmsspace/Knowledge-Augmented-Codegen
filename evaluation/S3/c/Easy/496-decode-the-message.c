// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-the-message/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the strings key and message, which represent a cipher key and a secret message, respectively. The steps to decode message are as follows:
//
//
// 	Use the first appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters in key as the order of the substitution table.
// 	Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
// 	Each letter in message is then substituted using the table.
// 	Spaces ' ' are transformed to themselves.
//
//
//
// 	For example, given key = "happy boy" (actual key would have at least one instance of each letter in the alphabet), we have the partial substitution table of ('h' -> 'a', 'a' -> 'b', 'p' -> 'c', 'y' -> 'd', 'b' -> 'e', 'o' -> 'f').
//
//
// Return the decoded message.
//
// Example:
// Input: key = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", message = "vkbs bs t suepuv"
// Output: "this is a secret"
// Explanation: The diagram above shows the substitution table.
// It is obtained by taking the first appearance of each letter in "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
//
// Constraints:
// 26 <= key.length <= 2000
// 	key consists of lowercase English letters and ' '.
// 	key contains every letter in the English alphabet ('a' to 'z') at least once.
// 	1 <= message.length <= 2000
// 	message consists of lowercase English letters and ' '.

// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
// - Data Compression (trie, array, trie-match, greedy, simulation)
//   • When to use: When needing to reduce the size of data by encoding frequently occurring patterns or symbols with shorter representations, especially for lossless compression of text or binary streams.
//   • Idea: Data compression algorithms like Huffman coding and LZW reduce data size by assigning variable-length codes based on frequency or by replacing repeated patterns with shorter references. Huffman coding typically involves O(N log N) for building the tree and O(N) for encoding/decoding, while LZW can be O(N) for both, where N is the input size.
//   • Invariants: The encoding process consistently maps input symbols or sequences to their assigned codes.; The decoding process reconstructs the original data by traversing the encoding structure using the compressed bitstream.
//   • Tips: Use a min-priority queue to efficiently build the Huffman tree from character frequencies.; Represent Huffman codes as bit strings for efficient storage and transmission.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like empty input or single-character input.; Off-by-one errors when reading/writing bit streams.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
