// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string array words and a binary array groups both of length n.
//
// A subsequence of words is alternating if for any two consecutive strings in the sequence, their corresponding elements at the same indices in groups are different (that is, there cannot be consecutive 0 or 1).
//
// Your task is to select the longest alternating subsequence from words.
//
// Return the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
//
// Note: The elements in words are distinct.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["e","a","b"], groups = [0,0,1]
//
// Output: ["e","b"]
//
// Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is ["e","b"] because groups[0] != groups[2]. Another subsequence that can be selected is ["a","b"] because groups[1] != groups[2]. It can be demonstrated that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == words.length == groups.length <= 100
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 10
// 	groups[i] is either 0 or 1.
// 	words consists of distinct strings.
// 	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal ordering of non-contiguous elements.
//   • Idea: This DP approach calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in an array. It builds upon previously computed subsequence lengths, resulting in an O(N^2) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: dp[i] stores the length of the LIS ending at index i.; For any j < i, if A[j] < A[i], then dp[j] + 1 is a candidate length for dp[i].
//   • Tips: Initialize DP array with 1s, as each element itself forms an LIS of length 1.; Iterate through all previous elements to find potential predecessors.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to initialize the DP array correctly.; Incorrectly handling the strict increasing condition (e.g., allowing equality).
// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, coordinate-compress, segment-tree, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements must be strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal substructure on sequences with an increasing property.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are in increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree with coordinate compression.
//   • Invariants: The `dp` array (or segment tree) stores information about the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The `dp` array, if used, remains sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) solution uses a `dp` array storing the smallest ending element for all increasing subsequences of a given length.; Binary search (`lower_bound`) efficiently finds the correct position to update in the `dp` array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates; LIS typically requires strictly increasing elements.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, segment-tree, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence such that elements in the subsequence are in strictly increasing order, preserving their original relative order.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the longest subsequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search or a segment tree.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or DP array) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index 'i', 'tails[i]' stores the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array where dp[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Binary search is used to find the correct position for the current element in the dp array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates for strictly increasing versus non-decreasing requirements.

// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
