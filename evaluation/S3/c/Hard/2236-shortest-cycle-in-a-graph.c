// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-cycle-in-a-graph/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a bi-directional graph with n vertices, where each vertex is labeled from 0 to n - 1. The edges in the graph are represented by a given 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes an edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.
//
// Return the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return -1.
//
// A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is used only once.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,3]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The cycle with the smallest length is : 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 1000
// 	1 <= edges.length <= 1000
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ui, vi < n
// 	ui != vi
// 	There are no repeated edges.

// - Undirected Graphs (graph, array, simulation)
//   • When to use: When modeling symmetric relationships between entities and needing to explore, analyze connectivity, or find paths within the network. Useful for problems involving reachability or structural properties.
//   • Idea: Undirected graphs represent symmetric relationships between pairs of vertices. Simulation on them involves systematically exploring or processing these connections, often with O(V+E) complexity for basic traversals.
//   • Invariants: All vertices reachable from the source within 'k' edges have been processed by the 'k'-th step of BFS.; Each edge in the graph is traversed at most twice (once for each direction) during a full graph traversal.
//   • Tips: Use an adjacency list for sparse graphs to optimize space and traversal time.; Use an adjacency matrix for dense graphs or when O(1) edge existence checks are critical.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected components, leading to incomplete graph processing.; Incorrectly representing undirected edges (e.g., only adding one direction to an adjacency list).
// - Finding the Eulerian path in O(M) (graph, enumeration, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem requires visiting every edge in a graph exactly once, either starting and ending at the same vertex (cycle) or at two different vertices (path).
//   • Idea: An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. An Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian path that starts and ends on the same vertex.
//   • Invariants: Every edge in the graph is considered exactly once for inclusion in the path.; The current path segment always forms a valid trail in the graph.
//   • Tips: Check vertex degrees to determine path/cycle existence before attempting to find it.; For an Eulerian path, start traversal from one of the two odd-degree vertices.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling multi-edges or self-loops can lead to errors in degree calculation or traversal.; Failing to check graph connectivity can result in incomplete paths or infinite loops.
// - Undirected Graphs (graph, matrix, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when modeling symmetric relationships between entities, analyzing graph properties like connectivity or degrees, or simulating processes on a network where connections are bidirectional.
//   • Idea: An undirected graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges, where each edge connects two vertices symmetrically. Basic operations often have a time complexity of O(V+E) or O(V^2) depending on representation.
//   • Invariants: For every edge (u, v) in the graph, the edge (v, u) also exists.; The sum of degrees of all vertices equals twice the number of edges.
//   • Tips: Choose adjacency list for sparse graphs, adjacency matrix for dense graphs.; Degrees of vertices are easily calculated from adjacency representations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to add both (u,v) and (v,u) when using an adjacency matrix or list.; Not handling disconnected components during full graph traversals.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
