// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-form-a-target-string-given-a-dictionary/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a list of strings of the same length words and a string target.
//
// Your task is to form target using the given words under the following rules:
//
//
// 	target should be formed from left to right.
// 	To form the ith character (0-indexed) of target, you can choose the kth character of the jth string in words if target[i] = words[j][k].
// 	Once you use the kth character of the jth string of words, you can no longer use the xth character of any string in words where x <= k. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index k become unusuable for every string.
// 	Repeat the process until you form the string target.
//
//
// Notice that you can use multiple characters from the same string in words provided the conditions above are met.
//
// Return the number of ways to form target from words. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"
// Output: 6
// Explanation: There are 6 ways to form target.
// "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
// "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
// "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
// "aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
// "aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
// "aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
// 	All strings in words have the same length.
// 	1 <= target.length <= 1000
// 	words[i] and target contain only lowercase English letters.

// - The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (string, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to determine the frequency of characters or substrings within a string. It is essential for tasks like anagram detection or checking character distribution.
//   • Idea: This technique involves iterating through a string to tally the occurrences of its constituent elements, typically characters or words. It generally operates in O(N) time complexity, where N is the string's length.
//   • Invariants: The count for each character reflects its total occurrences processed so far.; All characters encountered up to the current position have been tallied.
//   • Tips: Use a hash map (dictionary) for arbitrary character sets.; Use an array for fixed-size character sets (e.g., ASCII, lowercase English).
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle case sensitivity or ignore non-alphanumeric characters.; Incorrectly handling Unicode characters with fixed-size arrays.
// - String Sorts (array, string, number, radix-sort, counting-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when sorting a large collection of fixed-length strings or integers, especially when the key range (alphabet size) is small. It is efficient for data with uniform key lengths.
//   • Idea: LSD Radix Sort sorts elements by processing digits or characters from the least significant to the most significant, using a stable counting sort for each position. It achieves a time complexity of O(W * (N + R)), where W is the key length, N is the number of items, and R is the radix.
//   • Invariants: After each pass 'd' (from 'w-1' down to '0'), the array 'a' is stably sorted based on characters from position 'd' to 'w-1'.; The 'count' array accurately reflects the frequency of each character at the current digit 'd' before cumulation.
//   • Tips: Utilize counting sort as the stable inner sorting algorithm for each digit pass.; Process characters or digits from right to left (least significant to most significant).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for variable-length strings without proper padding or specialized handling.; Can be slower than comparison sorts for small input sizes or very large radix (R).
// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
