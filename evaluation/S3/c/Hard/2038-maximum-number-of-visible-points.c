// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-visible-points/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array points, an integer angle, and your location, where location = [posx, posy] and points[i] = [xi, yi] both denote integral coordinates on the X-Y plane.
//
// Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You cannot move from your position, but you can rotate. In other words, posx and posy cannot be changed. Your field of view in degrees is represented by angle, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let d be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is the inclusive range of angles [d - angle/2, d + angle/2].

//
//
// You can see some set of points if, for each point, the angle formed by the point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position is in your field of view.
//
// There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation. Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.
//
// Return the maximum number of points you can see.
//
// Example:
// Input: points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,3]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The shaded region represents your field of view. All points can be made visible in your field of view, including [3,3] even though [2,2] is in front and in the same line of sight.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= points.length <= 105
// 	points[i].length == 2
// 	location.length == 2
// 	0 <= angle < 360
// 	0 <= posx, posy, xi, yi <= 100

// - Convex Hull construction (geometry, array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in a plane. It is fundamental for various geometric algorithms and optimization problems.
//   • Idea: Convex hull construction identifies the subset of points that form the vertices of the smallest convex polygon containing all given points. Common algorithms achieve this in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The sequence of points currently forming the hull maintains a convex property.; All points considered up to the current iteration are either part of the hull or lie within the polygon defined by the hull.
//   • Tips: Sort points by X-coordinate (and Y for ties) as a common preprocessing step.; Consider algorithms like Graham Scan or Monotone Chain for efficiency.
//   • Pitfalls: Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect orientation calculations.; Incorrectly handling collinear points can result in non-minimal hulls or errors.
// - Finding the equation of a line for a segment (geometry, number, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks to count or list all possible combinations, permutations, or arrangements of elements. It's suitable when a brute-force check of all possibilities is feasible.
//   • Idea: Enumeration systematically generates and examines all possible solutions to a problem. This approach guarantees finding the correct answer if one exists, typically with exponential time complexity O(k^N) or O(N!).
//   • Invariants: At each step, the current partial solution is valid according to problem constraints.; All previously explored partial solutions have been processed or discarded.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space and the properties of valid solutions.; Use recursion or iterative loops to explore all branches of the solution space.
//   • Pitfalls: Overlooking edge cases or constraints that limit the search space.; Generating duplicate solutions if not handled carefully.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
