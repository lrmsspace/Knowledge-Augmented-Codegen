// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-connected-components-in-lcm-graph/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of integers nums of size n and a positive integer threshold.
//
// There is a graph consisting of n nodes with the ith node having a value of nums[i]. Two nodes i and j in the graph are connected via an undirected edge if lcm(nums[i], nums[j]) <= threshold.
//
// Return the number of connected components in this graph.
//
// A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.
//
// The term lcm(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,4,8,3,9], threshold = 5
//
// Output: 4
//
// Explanation: 
//
//
//
//  
//
// The four connected components are (2, 4), (3), (8), (9).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
// 	All elements of nums are unique.
// 	1 <= threshold <= 2 * 105

// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, tree, array, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and efficiently perform union operations to merge sets or find the representative of an element's set.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: finding the representative of an element's set and merging two sets. With path compression and union by rank/size, these operations achieve nearly constant amortized time complexity, O(alpha(N)).
//   • Invariants: Each element `v` is either a root (parent[v] == v) or has a parent pointer to another element in its set.; The `find_set` operation, after path compression, ensures that all nodes on the path from `v` to its root directly point to the root.
//   • Tips: Implement path compression in `find_set` for optimal performance.; Use union by rank or union by size to keep trees flat and balanced.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting path compression or union by rank/size leads to O(N) worst-case operations.; Incorrectly merging sets by only updating one root without considering the other's rank/size.
// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, linked-list, union-find, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and perform union operations to merge sets or find the representative of an element's set efficiently. It's suitable for problems involving dynamic connectivity or grouping elements.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: finding the representative of an element's set and merging two sets. It achieves nearly constant time complexity for these operations with path compression and union by rank/size optimizations.
//   • Invariants: Every element `i` belongs to exactly one set, represented by `find(i)`.; If `parent[i] == i`, then `i` is the representative (root) of its set.
//   • Tips: Implement path compression in `find` for optimal performance.; Use union by size or rank to maintain balanced trees.
//   • Pitfalls: Omitting path compression or union by rank/size can degrade performance to O(N).; Failing to correctly update auxiliary data stored at representatives during a union operation.
// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, tree, array, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently manage a collection of disjoint sets, supporting operations to merge sets and determine if two elements belong to the same set.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that maintains a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: union (merging two sets) and find (determining the representative of an element's set). With path compression and union by rank/size, operations achieve nearly O(1) amortized time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any element `v`, `parent[v]` is either `v` itself (if `v` is a root) or an ancestor of `v`.; All elements belonging to the same set share a common root representative.
//   • Tips: Apply path compression during `find_set` to optimize future queries.; Utilize union by rank or size to maintain balanced trees.
//   • Pitfalls: Omitting path compression or union by rank/size results in poor performance.; Failing to correctly identify the root of a set in `find_set`.

// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
