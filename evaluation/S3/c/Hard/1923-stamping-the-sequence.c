//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two strings stamp and target. Initially, there is a string s of length target.length with all s[i] == '?'.
//
// In one turn, you can place stamp over s and replace every letter in the s with the corresponding letter from stamp.
//
//
// 	For example, if stamp = "abc" and target = "abcba", then s is "?????" initially. In one turn you can:
//
// 	
// 		place stamp at index 0 of s to obtain "abc??",
// 		place stamp at index 1 of s to obtain "?abc?", or
// 		place stamp at index 2 of s to obtain "??abc".
// 	
// 	Note that stamp must be fully contained in the boundaries of s in order to stamp (i.e., you cannot place stamp at index 3 of s).
//
//
// We want to convert s to target using at most 10 * target.length turns.
//
// Return an array of the index of the left-most letter being stamped at each turn. If we cannot obtain target from s within 10 * target.length turns, return an empty array.
//
// Example:
// Input: stamp = "abc", target = "ababc"
// Output: [0,2]
// Explanation: Initially s = "?????".
// - Place stamp at index 0 to get "abc??".
// - Place stamp at index 2 to get "ababc".
// [1,0,2] would also be accepted as an answer, as well as some other answers.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= stamp.length <= target.length <= 1000
// 	stamp and target consist of lowercase English letters.

// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (trie, queue, bitset, aho-corasick, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when searching for multiple patterns simultaneously within a larger text. It is highly efficient for finding all occurrences of a dictionary of keywords.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a set of patterns, allowing efficient simultaneous searching for all patterns in a text. It typically achieves O(N + M + K) time complexity, where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: All patterns in the dictionary are correctly represented as paths in the trie structure.; For any state `s`, its failure link `fail[s]` points to the longest proper prefix of the string represented by `s` that is also a suffix of `s` and exists in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, representing each pattern as a path.; Use BFS to construct failure links, pointing to the longest proper prefix of the current state's string that is also a suffix.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; High memory usage if the pattern set is very large or patterns are excessively long.
// - Aho-Corasick algorithm (trie, graph, bfs, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns within a larger text. It is ideal for scenarios requiring simultaneous searching for multiple dictionary words.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a set of patterns, allowing linear time searching for all pattern occurrences in a text. It extends a trie with suffix links and failure transitions for efficient traversal, achieving O(N + M + K) complexity where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: All nodes at depth 'd' have their suffix links correctly computed before processing nodes at depth 'd+1'.; For any node 'u', its suffix link points to the longest proper suffix of the string represented by 'u' that is also a prefix of some pattern.
//   • Tips: Build the trie from all patterns first, marking nodes that represent the end of a pattern.; Compute suffix links using a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the root.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly computing suffix links can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; High memory usage can occur for large alphabets or a vast number of patterns.
// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
