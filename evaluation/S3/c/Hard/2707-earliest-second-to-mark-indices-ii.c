// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-second-to-mark-indices-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two 1-indexed integer arrays, nums and, changeIndices, having lengths n and m, respectively.
//
// Initially, all indices in nums are unmarked. Your task is to mark all indices in nums.
//
// In each second, s, in order from 1 to m (inclusive), you can perform one of the following operations:
//
//
// 	Choose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrement nums[i] by 1.
// 	Set nums[changeIndices[s]] to any non-negative value.
// 	Choose an index i in the range [1, n], where nums[i] is equal to 0, and mark index i.
// 	Do nothing.
//
//
// Return an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [3,2,3], changeIndices = [1,3,2,2,2,2,3]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
// Second 1: Set nums[changeIndices[1]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,3].
// Second 2: Set nums[changeIndices[2]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,0].
// Second 3: Set nums[changeIndices[3]] to 0. nums becomes [0,0,0].
// Second 4: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.
// Second 5: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
// Second 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.
// Now all indices have been marked.
// It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second.
// Hence, the answer is 6.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == nums.length <= 5000
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 109
// 	1 <= m == changeIndices.length <= 5000
// 	1 <= changeIndices[i] <= n

// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// -  
// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When searching for a specific element in a sorted collection or finding an optimal value over a monotonic function within a defined range. It efficiently reduces the search space by half in each step.
//   • Idea: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or determines a value that satisfies a monotonic predicate. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The potential answer always lies within the current search interval `[low, high]`.; All elements strictly less than `low` have been determined not to be the answer.
//   • Tips: Ensure the search space exhibits a monotonic property.; Carefully define the `low` and `high` bounds for the search interval.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating `low` or `high` bounds leading to infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing or loop conditions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
