//
// Problem Description:
// There are buckets buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.
//
// You can feed the pigs according to these steps:
//
//
// 	Choose some live pigs to feed.
// 	For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
// 	Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.
// 	After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
// 	Repeat this process until you run out of time.
//
//
// Given buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.
//
// Example:
// Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15
// Output: 2
// Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
// At time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.
// At time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:
// - If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
// - If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
// - If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
// - If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= buckets <= 1000
// 	1 <= minutesToDie <= minutesToTest <= 100

// - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem can be solved by making the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping this leads to a globally optimal solution. This strategy is often simpler and faster than dynamic programming.
//   • Idea: The greedy algorithm makes the best choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum, without reconsidering previous choices. Its time complexity is typically O(N log N) or O(N).
//   • Invariants: At each step, the chosen element is the best available according to the greedy criterion.; The partial solution constructed so far remains optimal for the subproblem considered.
//   • Tips: Prove correctness by exchange argument or induction.; Sort input data if it helps identify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to prove the greedy choice property.; Making a locally optimal choice that prevents a global optimum.
// - Fibonacci Numbers (number, greedy, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need a unique, non-ambiguous binary representation of positive integers based on Fibonacci numbers, ensuring no two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are used in the sum.
//   • Idea: This algorithm encodes a positive integer into a unique binary string by greedily finding its Zeckendorf representation (sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers). The encoding process typically involves iterating through Fibonacci numbers, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity relative to the input number's magnitude.
//   • Invariants: The remaining value 'n' to be encoded is always non-negative.; The partial binary code constructed so far represents a valid Zeckendorf sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
//   • Tips: Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a certain limit to optimize lookups.; Always start with the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the target value.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the base cases for small numbers like 1 or 2.; Forgetting to append the mandatory final '1' bit to the codeword.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
