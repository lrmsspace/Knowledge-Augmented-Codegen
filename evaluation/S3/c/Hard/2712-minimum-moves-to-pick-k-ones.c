// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-pick-k-ones/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a binary array nums of length n, a positive integer k and a non-negative integer maxChanges.
//
// Alice plays a game, where the goal is for Alice to pick up k ones from nums using the minimum number of moves. When the game starts, Alice picks up any index aliceIndex in the range [0, n - 1] and stands there. If nums[aliceIndex] == 1 , Alice picks up the one and nums[aliceIndex] becomes 0(this does not count as a move). After this, Alice can make any number of moves (including zero) where in each move Alice must perform exactly one of the following actions:
//
//
//  Select any index j != aliceIndex such that nums[j] == 0 and set nums[j] = 1. This action can be performed at most maxChanges times.
//  Select any two adjacent indices x and y (|x - y| == 1) such that nums[x] == 1, nums[y] == 0, then swap their values (set nums[y] = 1 and nums[x] = 0). If y == aliceIndex, Alice picks up the one after this move and nums[y] becomes 0.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of moves required by Alice to pick exactly k ones.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], k = 3, maxChanges = 1
//
// Output: 3
//
// Explanation: Alice can pick up 3 ones in 3 moves, if Alice performs the following actions in each move when standing at aliceIndex == 1:
//
//
//  At the start of the game Alice picks up the one and nums[1] becomes 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1].
//  Select j == 2 and perform an action of the first type. nums becomes [1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]
//  Select x == 2 and y == 1, and perform an action of the second type. nums becomes [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. As y == aliceIndex, Alice picks up the one and nums becomes [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1].
//  Select x == 0 and y == 1, and perform an action of the second type. nums becomes [0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. As y == aliceIndex, Alice picks up the one and nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1].
//
//
// Note that it may be possible for Alice to pick up 3 ones using some other sequence of 3 moves.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 105
//  0 <= nums[i] <= 1
//  1 <= k <= 105
//  0 <= maxChanges <= 105
//  maxChanges + sum(nums) >= k

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// -  
// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    // This problem is quite complex and requires a careful approach to solve efficiently.
    // The main idea is to use a sliding window technique to find the minimum number of moves required to pick k ones.
    // We will maintain a window that contains exactly k ones and calculate the number of moves needed to bring those ones together.
    // We also need to consider the maxChanges allowed to flip zeros to ones.
