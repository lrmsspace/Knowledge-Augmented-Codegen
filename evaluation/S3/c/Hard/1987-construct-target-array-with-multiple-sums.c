// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-target-array-with-multiple-sums/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array target of n integers. From a starting array arr consisting of n 1's, you may perform the following procedure :
//
//
// 	let x be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
// 	choose index i, such that 0 <= i < n and set the value of arr at index i to x.
// 	You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.
//
//
// Return true if it is possible to construct the target array from arr, otherwise, return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: target = [9,3,5]
// Output: true
// Explanation: Start with arr = [1, 1, 1] 
// [1, 1, 1], sum = 3 choose index 1
// [1, 3, 1], sum = 5 choose index 2
// [1, 3, 5], sum = 9 choose index 0
// [9, 3, 5] Done
//
// Constraints:
// n == target.length
// 	1 <= n <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= target[i] <= 109

// - Optimal schedule of jobs given their deadlines and durations (array, heap, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when given a set of tasks with deadlines and durations, and the objective is to maximize the number of completed tasks without interruption.
//   • Idea: This greedy algorithm aims to maximize the number of jobs completed by prioritizing tasks that finish earliest. It typically involves sorting and using a min-heap, achieving an O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed up to the current point have been considered for scheduling.; The set of jobs in the heap represents the jobs currently scheduled to meet their deadlines.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs by their deadlines in ascending order.; Maintain a min-heap of durations for jobs currently scheduled.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing job count maximization with total duration or profit.; Failing to update the current time correctly after scheduling a job.
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (heap, array, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the k-th largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently without fully sorting it. It is particularly effective when k is much smaller than N.
//   • Idea: This algorithm uses a min-heap of size k to store the k largest elements encountered so far. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the heap's minimum; if larger, it replaces the minimum, resulting in O(N log K) time complexity and O(K) space complexity.
//   • Invariants: The min-heap always contains at most k elements.; Every element in the min-heap is greater than or equal to any element that has been processed and discarded.
//   • Tips: Use a min-heap to find the k-th largest element, and a max-heap for the k-th smallest.; Initialize the heap with the first k elements from the input array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a max-heap when trying to find the k-th largest element.; Failing to handle edge cases such as k=1 or k equal to the array's length.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
