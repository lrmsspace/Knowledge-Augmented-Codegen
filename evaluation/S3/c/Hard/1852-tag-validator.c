// Problem Description:
// Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.
//
// A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:
//
//
// 	The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
// 	A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
// 	A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
// 	A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
// 	A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
// 	A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
// 	The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.
// 	CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.
//
// Example:
// Input: code = "<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>"
// Output: true
// Explanation: 
// The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
// The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
// Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.
// So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= code.length <= 500
// 	code consists of English letters, digits, '<', '>', '/', '!', '[', ']', '.', and ' '.

// - Data Compression (trie, array, trie-match, greedy, simulation)
//   • When to use: When needing to reduce the size of data by encoding frequently occurring patterns or symbols with shorter representations, especially for lossless compression of text or binary streams.
//   • Idea: Data compression algorithms like Huffman coding and LZW reduce data size by assigning variable-length codes based on frequency or by replacing repeated patterns with shorter references. Huffman coding typically involves O(N log N) for building the tree and O(N) for encoding/decoding, while LZW can be O(N) for both, where N is the input size.
//   • Invariants: The encoding process consistently maps input symbols or sequences to their assigned codes.; The decoding process reconstructs the original data by traversing the encoding structure using the compressed bitstream.
//   • Tips: Use a min-priority queue to efficiently build the Huffman tree from character frequencies.; Represent Huffman codes as bit strings for efficient storage and transmission.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like empty input or single-character input.; Off-by-one errors when reading/writing bit streams.
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this when verifying if a sequence of delimiters is correctly nested and balanced. It is also applicable for counting or generating all possible valid sequences of a given length.
//   • Idea: This algorithm involves checking if a sequence of opening and closing delimiters is properly matched and nested, or enumerating such sequences. Validation typically uses a stack in O(N) time, while generation often involves backtracking with O(Catalan(N)) complexity.
//   • Invariants: The stack contains only opening delimiters that are yet to be matched.; The balance counter (open - close) is never negative at any point during traversal.
//   • Tips: Use a stack to track unmatched opening delimiters for validation.; Maintain a balance counter (increment for open, decrement for close) for a simpler check.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if the stack is empty after processing the entire sequence.; Allowing a closing delimiter when no matching opening delimiter is available (empty stack or mismatch).
// - Suffix Automaton (graph, string, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use to efficiently represent all suffixes of a string in a compressed form, ideal for various string problems like pattern matching or counting distinct substrings.
//   • Idea: A suffix automaton is a minimal Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that accepts all suffixes of a given string, offering O(N) time construction and O(N) memory complexity.
//   • Invariants: Every state in the automaton represents a set of substrings of the original string.; Each state's longest path from the initial state corresponds to its longest string.
//   • Tips: Understand the definition of states and transitions, and their relationship to substrings.; Leverage its linear time and space complexity for efficient string processing on large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: The construction algorithm can be complex and challenging to implement correctly.; Debugging state transitions, suffix links, and their properties requires careful attention.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
