//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [lefti, righti] describes the ith interval starting at lefti and ending at righti (inclusive). The size of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally righti - lefti + 1.
//
// You are also given an integer array queries. The answer to the jth query is the size of the smallest interval i such that lefti <= queries[j] <= righti. If no such interval exists, the answer is -1.
//
// Return an array containing the answers to the queries.
//
// Example:
// Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
// Output: [3,3,1,4]
// Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
// - Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
// - Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
// - Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.
// - Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= intervals.length <= 105
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	intervals[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= lefti <= righti <= 107
// 	1 <= queries[j] <= 107

// - Mergesort (array, merge-sort, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when a stable sort with guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or external sorting where data might not fit in memory.
//   • Idea: Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and requires O(N) auxiliary space.
//   • Invariants: The elements `index[lo...k-1]` are sorted and contain the smallest `k-lo` elements from the original `aux[lo...mid]` and `aux[mid+1...hi]` segments.; Pointer `i` always indicates the next element to consider from the left sorted sub-array (`aux[lo...mid]`).
//   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to ensure stability.; Consider an iterative bottom-up approach to avoid recursion overhead.
//   • Pitfalls: High auxiliary space complexity (O(N)) can be a concern for memory-constrained systems.; Recursive calls can lead to stack overflow for very large inputs without tail call optimization.
// - Scheduling jobs on one machine (array, number, greedy, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when scheduling a set of jobs on a single machine to minimize the total weighted completion time, where each job has a processing time and a linear penalty coefficient.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds an optimal schedule for jobs on a single machine with linear penalty functions by sorting jobs based on a specific ratio. It achieves an optimal solution in O(N log N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The partial schedule constructed so far is optimal for the jobs included.; For any two adjacent jobs 'j' and 'k' in the final schedule, if 'j' precedes 'k', then 'c_j/t_j >= c_k/t_k'.
//   • Tips: Derive the sorting criterion using an exchange argument for adjacent jobs.; The optimal order is determined by the ratio of cost coefficient to processing time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the sorting criterion, especially the ratio order.; Overlooking edge cases like zero processing times or zero penalty coefficients.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given function signature unchanged.
// - Use the C standard library only; no external packages.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: ISO C (C89/C99/C11). Do NOT use GNU C extensions (nested functions, statement expressions, typeof, __auto_type, etc.). Avoid VLAs and non-standard builtins.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
