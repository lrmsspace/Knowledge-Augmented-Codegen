//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of strings words and a character separator, split each string in words by separator.
//
// Return an array of strings containing the new strings formed after the splits, excluding empty strings.
//
// Notes
//
//
// 	separator is used to determine where the split should occur, but it is not included as part of the resulting strings.
// 	A split may result in more than two strings.
// 	The resulting strings must maintain the same order as they were initially given.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["one.two.three","four.five","six"], separator = "."
// Output: ["one","two","three","four","five","six"]
// Explanation: In this example we split as follows:
//
// "one.two.three" splits into "one", "two", "three"
// "four.five" splits into "four", "five"
// "six" splits into "six" 
//
// Hence, the resulting array is ["one","two","three","four","five","six"].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 100
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 20
// 	characters in words[i] are either lowercase English letters or characters from the string ".,|$#@" (excluding the quotes)
// 	separator is a character from the string ".,|$#@" (excluding the quotes)

// - palindrome-partitioning (string, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: When a string needs to be decomposed into all possible sets of palindromic substrings. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive enumeration of such partitions.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all possible ways to partition a given string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. It typically uses a recursive exploration approach combined with a two-pointer check for palindrome validation, resulting in an exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: At any point, the `step` list contains a valid palindromic partition of the prefix processed so far.; The `s` parameter in the recursive function always represents the unpartitioned suffix of the original string.
//   • Tips: Implement the `isPalindrome` check efficiently using two pointers for O(length) time.; Use a recursive helper function to explore all possible partition points.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling substring boundaries, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect partitions.; Forgetting to backtrack (remove the last added substring) after a recursive call returns.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public List<String> splitWordsBySeparator(List<String> words, char separator) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            String[] splitWords = word.split(Pattern.quote(String.valueOf(separator)));
            for (String splitWord : splitWords) {
                if (!splitWord.isEmpty()) {
                    result.add(splitWord);
