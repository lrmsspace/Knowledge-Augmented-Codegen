// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-a-string-into-groups-of-size-k/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure:
//
//
// 	The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each element can be a part of exactly one group.
// 	For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.
//
//
// Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.
//
// Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"
// Output: ["abc","def","ghi"]
// Explanation:
// The first 3 characters "abc" form the first group.
// The next 3 characters "def" form the second group.
// The last 3 characters "ghi" form the third group.
// Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.
// Thus, the groups formed are "abc", "def", and "ghi".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 100
// 	s consists of lowercase English letters only.
// 	1 <= k <= 100
// 	fill is a lowercase English letter.

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Substring Search (string, array, kmp, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when efficiently finding all occurrences or the first occurrence of a pattern within a larger text, especially when the pattern might have repeating or overlapping prefixes.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that avoids re-scanning characters in the text by pre-processing the pattern to build a 'longest proper prefix suffix' (LPS) array. It achieves optimal O(N + M) time complexity, where N is the text length and M is the pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `j` pointer always indicates the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `text[0...i-1]`.; The `lps[j]` value stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...j-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...j-1]`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the LPS array (also known as failure function or border array) for the pattern.; The LPS array helps determine the next best match position after a mismatch, avoiding redundant comparisons.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the LPS array can lead to wrong matches or infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors when indexing the pattern or text are common.
// - Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-p (string, array, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When you need to find all palindromic substrings or the longest palindromic substring within a given string efficiently. It is particularly useful for achieving linear time complexity for this task.
//   • Idea: Manacher's algorithm finds all maximal palindromic substrings centered at each position in a string by leveraging symmetry and previously computed results. It achieves an optimal O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: d_odd[i] stores the radius of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.; The (l, r) interval always defines the rightmost palindrome found so far.
//   • Tips: Preprocess the string with delimiters to unify odd and even length palindromes.; Maintain the current rightmost boundary `r` of the largest palindrome found.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update the `(l, r)` boundaries after processing each center.; Incorrectly calculating mirror positions or handling boundary cases for `i > r`.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public String[] divideString(String s, int k, char fill) {
        int n = s.length();
        int numGroups = (n + k - 1) / k; // Calculate the number of groups needed
        String[] groups = new String[numGroups];

        for (int i = 0; i < numGroups; i++) {
            int start = i * k;
            int end = Math.min(start + k, n); // Ensure we don't go out of bounds
            String group = s.substring(start, end);

            // If the last group is shorter than k, fill it with the fill character
            if (group.length() < k) {
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(group);
                while (sb.length() < k) {
                    sb.append(fill);
                }
                group = sb.toString();
            }

            groups[i] = group;
        }

        return groups;
