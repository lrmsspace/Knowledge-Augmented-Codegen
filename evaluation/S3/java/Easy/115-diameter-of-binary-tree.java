//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
//
// The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
//
// The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
// 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Depth-first search (graph, array, stack, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to explore all reachable vertices from a starting point or systematically visit all nodes in a graph or tree. It's suitable for problems requiring full exploration of a branch before backtracking.
//   • Idea: Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically using a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion).
//   • Invariants: Every node `v` in the graph is either visited or not yet visited.; The recursion stack (or explicit stack) always contains a path from the source node to the current node being explored.
//   • Tips: Use a `visited` array or set to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often cleaner for implementation, but iterative DFS with an explicit stack avoids recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited leads to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
