// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.
//
// Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
// Output: true
// Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 100
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 20
// 	order.length == 26
// 	All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
