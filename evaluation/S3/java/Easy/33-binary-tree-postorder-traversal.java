// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
//
// Output: [3,2,1]
//
// Explanation:
//
// Constraints:
// The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
// 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
//
//
//  
// Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Prüfer code (tree, array, simulation, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: When needing to encode a labeled tree into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers, particularly when an efficient linear-time construction is required.
//   • Idea: The Prüfer code algorithm converts a labeled tree with N vertices into a unique sequence of N-2 numbers by iteratively removing the smallest-numbered leaf and recording its neighbor. This process can be optimized to run in O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: After 'k' iterations, 'k' leaves have been removed and 'k' numbers have been added to the Prüfer code.; The current tree always contains 'N - k' vertices and 'N - k - 1' edges.
//   • Tips: Use a degree array to efficiently track vertex degrees.; Maintain a pointer to the current smallest leaf candidate for linear time.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying the smallest-numbered leaf after removals.; Not updating degrees correctly, leading to wrong leaf identification.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
// - Topological Sorting (graph, array, dfs, topo)
//   • When to use: Use for graph or tree traversal, pathfinding, cycle detection, or topological sorting in DAGs. It's also suitable for exploring all states in a search space.
//   • Idea: DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically using recursion or an explicit stack. Topological sort orders nodes in a DAG such that for every directed edge u -> v, u comes before v, achievable with DFS in O(V+E) time.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the current path have been explored or are in the recursion stack.; A node is marked 'visited' only after all its descendants have been fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set/array to prevent infinite loops in graphs and redundant computations.; Recursion is natural for DFS, but an explicit stack can avoid recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.; Exceeding recursion depth limits for very deep graphs or trees.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
