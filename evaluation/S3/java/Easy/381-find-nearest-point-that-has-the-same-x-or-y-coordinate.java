// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-nearest-point-that-has-the-same-x-or-y-coordinate/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two integers, x and y, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid: (x, y). You are also given an array points where each points[i] = [ai, bi] represents that a point exists at (ai, bi). A point is valid if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.
//
// Return the index (0-indexed) of the valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location. If there are multiple, return the valid point with the smallest index. If there are no valid points, return -1.
//
// The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2).
//
// Example:
// Input: x = 3, y = 4, points = [[1,2],[3,1],[2,4],[2,3],[4,4]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Of all the points, only [3,1], [2,4] and [4,4] are valid. Of the valid points, [2,4] and [4,4] have the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location, with a distance of 1. [2,4] has the smallest index, so return 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= points.length <= 104
// 	points[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= x, y, ai, bi <= 104

// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
// - Manhattan Distance (geometry, number, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating distance between two points on a grid where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical directions. It is also useful for problems involving maximizing or minimizing sums of absolute coordinate differences, often transformable to Chebyshev distance.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance measures the sum of absolute differences of Cartesian coordinates between two points. It can be transformed into a Chebyshev distance problem by rotating coordinates, enabling efficient O(N) max/min distance calculations.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1=(x1, y1) and P2=(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is always non-negative.; The transformed points P1'=(x1+y1, y1-x1) and P2'=(x2+y2, y2-x2) satisfy Chebyshev(P1', P2') == Manhattan(P1, P2).
//   • Tips: Consider transforming to Chebyshev distance for max/min distance problems.; The transformation involves rotating coordinates: (x, y) -> (x+y, y-x).
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing with Euclidean distance, which allows diagonal movement.; Incorrectly applying coordinate transformation (e.g., wrong signs).
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
