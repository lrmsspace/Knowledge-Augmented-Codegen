//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array nums, return the number of subarrays of length 3 such that the sum of the first and third numbers equals exactly half of the second number.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,1,4,1]
//
// Output: 1
//
// Explanation:
//
// Only the subarray [1,4,1] contains exactly 3 elements where the sum of the first and third numbers equals half the middle number.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Integration by Simpson's formula (number, interval, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when approximating definite integrals of functions that are sufficiently smooth over a given interval. It is effective for achieving good accuracy with a moderate number of subintervals.
//   • Idea: Simpson's formula approximates a definite integral by dividing the integration interval into an even number of subintervals and approximating the function over each pair of subintervals with a parabola. This method offers a higher order of accuracy compared to simpler rules, typically achieving O(N^4) accuracy for N subintervals.
//   • Invariants: The sum accumulates weighted function values for all processed subintervals.; The subinterval width 'h' remains constant across the entire integration range.
//   • Tips: Ensure the total number of subintervals (2n) is always even for the composite rule.; The weights for function evaluations follow a specific 1-4-2-4-...-2-4-1 pattern.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the weighting coefficients, especially at the boundaries or interior points.; Using an odd number of subintervals, which invalidates the parabolic approximation for the composite rule.
// - Submask Enumeration
//  (number, bitset, enumeration, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When a problem requires iterating through all possible submasks for each given mask. This is common in bitmask dynamic programming problems where relationships between a set and its subsets are crucial.
//   • Idea: This algorithm efficiently iterates through all submasks for every mask from 0 to 2^N - 1. It has a total time complexity of O(3^N) for all masks and their submasks.
//   • Invariants: For a given `mask`, `submask` always represents a subset of `mask`.; Each `submask` is visited exactly once for its corresponding `mask`.
//   • Tips: The `submask = (submask - 1) & mask` trick is crucial for efficient iteration.; Ensure the outer loop iterates through all masks from 0 to 2^N - 1.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting the `& mask` part in the inner loop can lead to incorrect submasks or infinite loops.; Misunderstanding the O(3^N) total complexity, leading to Time Limit Exceeded for large N.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

    public int countSubarrays(int[] nums) {

            if (nums[i] + nums[i + 2] == nums[i + 1] / 2) {
                count++;
