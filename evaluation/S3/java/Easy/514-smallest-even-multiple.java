// Problem Description:
// Given a positive integer n, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 5
// Output: 10
// Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 5 and 2 is 10.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 150
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Gray code (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
//   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
//   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
// - Primality tests (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need to determine if a single number is prime, especially for numbers where trial division up to its square root is computationally feasible.
//   • Idea: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This method checks for primality by attempting to find a non-trivial divisor up to the square root of the given number, running in O(sqrt(N)) time.
//   • Invariants: No integer k in the range [2, current_divisor - 1] has been found to divide n.; The current value current_divisor is a candidate divisor being tested against n.
//   • Tips: Only check numbers between 2 and sqrt(n).; Handle 2 as a special case before iterating.
//   • Pitfalls: O(sqrt(N)) complexity can be too slow for very large numbers.; Incorrectly handling edge cases like 0, 1, or 2.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        // The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n is the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and n.
        // The LCM of two numbers a and b can be calculated using the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).
        // In this case, we need to calculate GCD(2, n) to find the LCM.

        int gcd = gcd(2, n);
        return (2 * n) / gcd;           
    }
