// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Gray code (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when generating a sequence of numbers where adjacent values must differ by only one bit, or for error detection in digital systems. It is also useful for certain combinatorial problems.
//   • Idea: Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in exactly one bit position. It can be generated efficiently using bitwise operations in O(1) time per code, or O(N) for N codes.
//   • Invariants: The number of bits in the generated Gray code G(n) is equal to the number of bits in the input binary n.; G(0) is always 0, and G(1) is always 1.
//   • Tips: The most common formula for converting binary n to Gray code G(n) is G(n) = n ^ (n >> 1).; To convert Gray code G(n) back to binary n, use a series of XOR operations: n = G(n) ^ (G(n) >> 1) ^ (G(n) >> 2) ^ ... until zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Gray code with standard binary representation, which can have multiple bit changes between successive numbers.; Incorrectly implementing the conversion formulas, especially the Gray to binary conversion.
// - Bit manipulation (number, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when operations on individual bits of an integer are required, for optimizing arithmetic with powers of two, or for efficient management of boolean flags.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators and shifts. These operations typically have O(1) time complexity as they are hardware-level instructions.
//   • Invariants: The total number of bits representing the integer remains constant for fixed-width types.; Applying `n & (1 << k)` isolates the k-th bit, setting all other bits to zero.
//   • Tips: Use `&` with `(1 << k)` to check if the k-th bit is set.; Use `|` with `(1 << k)` to set the k-th bit.
//   • Pitfalls: Be aware of integer overflow when performing large left shifts.; Understand the difference between arithmetic and logical right shifts, especially for signed numbers.
// - Bit manipulation (number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use for efficient low-level operations on integers, checking properties related to powers of two, or manipulating individual bits. It provides constant-time solutions for many numerical checks.
//   • Idea: This card covers fundamental bitwise operations for checking number properties like divisibility by powers of two, identifying powers of two, and manipulating individual bits. These operations typically run in O(1) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For a positive integer `n`, `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` if and only if `n` is a power of two.; An integer `n` is divisible by `2^k` if and only if its `k` least significant bits are all zero, which is checked by `(n & ((1 << k) - 1)) == 0`.
//   • Tips: Use `n & 1` to efficiently check if a number `n` is odd or even.; The expression `1 << k` calculates 2 raised to the power of `k`.
//   • Pitfalls: When checking if a number is a power of two, remember to handle the `n == 0` case separately as `0 & (-1)` is `0`.; Be cautious with integer overflow when performing left shifts (`1 << k`) for large `k` values.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

            result <<= 1; // Shift result left to make room for the next bit
            result |= (n & 1); // Add the least significant bit of n to result
            n >>= 1; // Shift n right to process the next bit
