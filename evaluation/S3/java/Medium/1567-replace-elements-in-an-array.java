// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array nums that consists of n distinct positive integers. Apply m operations to this array, where in the ith operation you replace the number operations[i][0] with operations[i][1].
//
// It is guaranteed that in the ith operation:
//
//
// 	operations[i][0] exists in nums.
// 	operations[i][1] does not exist in nums.
//
//
// Return the array obtained after applying all the operations.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,4,6], operations = [[1,3],[4,7],[6,1]]
// Output: [3,2,7,1]
// Explanation: We perform the following operations on nums:
// - Replace the number 1 with 3. nums becomes [3,2,4,6].
// - Replace the number 4 with 7. nums becomes [3,2,7,6].
// - Replace the number 6 with 1. nums becomes [3,2,7,1].
// We return the final array [3,2,7,1].
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	m == operations.length
// 	1 <= n, m <= 105
// 	All the values of nums are distinct.
// 	operations[i].length == 2
// 	1 <= nums[i], operations[i][0], operations[i][1] <= 106
// 	operations[i][0] will exist in nums when applying the ith operation.
// 	operations[i][1] will not exist in nums when applying the ith operation.

// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (ds, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently find the smallest non-negative integer not present in a dynamic sequence or range, supporting both updates and queries in logarithmic time.
//   • Idea: This technique finds the Minimal Excluded (MEX) value in a sequence by maintaining counts of distinct elements in ranges using a specialized data structure, typically a segment tree. It supports both updates and queries in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each segment tree node accurately reflects the count of distinct numbers within its corresponding range.; If a range [L, R) contains R-L distinct numbers, then all integers from L to R-1 are present.
//   • Tips: Implement a segment tree where each node stores the count of distinct numbers in its range.; The binary search for MEX checks if a range [0, k) contains k distinct numbers to decide which child to traverse.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating distinct counts in segment tree nodes, especially after updates.; Off-by-one errors when comparing the number of distinct elements with the expected count for a full range.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int[] arrayChange(int[] nums, int[][] operations) {
        // Map to store the index of each number in nums
        Map<Integer, Integer> indexMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            indexMap.put(nums[i], i);

            // Get the index of the old value
            int index = indexMap.get(oldValue);

            // Update the value in nums
