// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/reschedule-meetings-for-maximum-free-time-i/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer eventTime denoting the duration of an event, where the event occurs from time t = 0 to time t = eventTime.
//
// You are also given two integer arrays startTime and endTime, each of length n. These represent the start and end time of n non-overlapping meetings, where the ith meeting occurs during the time [startTime[i], endTime[i]].
//
// You can reschedule at most k meetings by moving their start time while maintaining the same duration, to maximize the longest continuous period of free time during the event.
//
// The relative order of all the meetings should stay the same and they should remain non-overlapping.
//
// Return the maximum amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.
//
// Note that the meetings can not be rescheduled to a time outside the event.
//
// Example:
// Input: eventTime = 5, k = 1, startTime = [1,3], endTime = [2,5]
//
// Output: 2
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
// Reschedule the meeting at [1, 2] to [2, 3], leaving no meetings during the time [0, 2].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= eventTime <= 109
// 	n == startTime.length == endTime.length
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= k <= n
// 	0 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= eventTime
// 	endTime[i] <= startTime[i + 1] where i lies in the range [0, n - 2].

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (array, binary-search-answer)
//   • When to use: Use when the problem asks for the minimum or maximum value that satisfies a monotonic condition.
//   • Idea: This technique finds a target value within a range by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, based on a monotonic condition. It typically achieves O(log N) time complexity for a search space of size N.
//   • Invariants: The optimal answer always lies within the current search range [low, high].; All values less than 'low' (for min search) or greater than 'high' (for max search) are known to be non-optimal.
//   • Tips: Clearly define the search space [low, high] for the answer.; Implement a `check` function that determines if a given `mid` value is a feasible solution.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the search range [low, high] for the answer.; Errors in the `check` function leading to incorrect monotonicity or logic.
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, enumeration)
//   • When to use: When searching for a specific element in a sorted collection or finding an optimal value over a monotonic function within a defined range. It efficiently reduces the search space by half in each step.
//   • Idea: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or determines a value that satisfies a monotonic predicate. It operates in logarithmic time complexity, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The potential answer always lies within the current search interval `[low, high]`.; All elements strictly less than `low` have been determined not to be the answer.
//   • Tips: Ensure the search space exhibits a monotonic property.; Carefully define the `low` and `high` bounds for the search interval.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating `low` or `high` bounds leading to infinite loops.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing or loop conditions.
// - Binary search (interval, number, binary-search-answer, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing a unimodal function (finding its maximum or minimum) over a continuous interval, where direct differentiation is hard or impossible.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a given interval by repeatedly narrowing the search space. It evaluates the function at two internal points to achieve logarithmic convergence.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function f(x) is always within the current interval [l, r].; The function f(x) remains unimodal within the current interval [l, r].
//   • Tips: Use a fixed number of iterations as a stopping criterion instead of an epsilon value for robustness against floating point errors.; For golden section search, reuse one function evaluation from the previous step to minimize expensive computations.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying this algorithm to a non-unimodal function will yield an incorrect result.; Floating point precision issues can lead to incorrect comparisons or infinite loops if `eps` is too small.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public int maxFreeTime(int eventTime, int k, int[] startTime, int[] endTime) {
        int n = startTime.length;
        int low = 0, high = eventTime;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (canAchieveFreeTime(mid, eventTime, k, startTime, endTime)) {
                high = mid; // Try for a smaller free time
            } else {
                low = mid + 1; // Need more free time
            }
        }
