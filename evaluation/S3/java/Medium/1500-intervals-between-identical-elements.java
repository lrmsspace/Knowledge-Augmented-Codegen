//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers arr.
//
// The interval between two elements in arr is defined as the absolute difference between their indices. More formally, the interval between arr[i] and arr[j] is |i - j|.
//
// Return an array intervals of length n where intervals[i] is the sum of intervals between arr[i] and each element in arr with the same value as arr[i].
//
// Note: |x| is the absolute value of x.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [2,1,3,1,2,3,3]
// Output: [4,2,7,2,4,4,5]
// Explanation:
// - Index 0: Another 2 is found at index 4. |0 - 4| = 4
// - Index 1: Another 1 is found at index 3. |1 - 3| = 2
// - Index 2: Two more 3s are found at indices 5 and 6. |2 - 5| + |2 - 6| = 7
// - Index 3: Another 1 is found at index 1. |3 - 1| = 2
// - Index 4: Another 2 is found at index 0. |4 - 0| = 4
// - Index 5: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 6. |5 - 2| + |5 - 6| = 4
// - Index 6: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 5. |6 - 2| + |6 - 5| = 5
//
// Constraints:
// n == arr.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= arr[i] <= 105
//

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Hash Tables (array, number, string, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently by transforming keys into array indices, managing potential collisions.
//   • Idea: Hash tables map keys to array indices using a hash function, enabling average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups by efficiently managing potential collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash function always produces an index within the valid array bounds [0, M-1].; For any two equal keys, their hash values remain identical.
//   • Tips: Design hash functions for uniform key distribution across the array.; Ensure hash functions are deterministic and efficient to compute.
//   • Pitfalls: Using a hash function that does not uniformly distribute keys, leading to many collisions.; Failing to implement a proper collision resolution strategy.
// - Hash Tables (array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use hash tables when efficient storage and retrieval of data by a key are required. They are ideal for implementing dictionaries, sets, or caches where average O(1) time complexity for operations is crucial.
//   • Idea: Hash tables store key-value pairs by mapping keys to array indices using a hash function and a collision resolution strategy. They provide average O(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.
//   • Invariants: Each key, if present, is stored at an index derived from its hash code.; If key1.equals(key2), their hash codes produce the same array index (before collision resolution).
//   • Tips: Design hash functions to distribute keys uniformly across the table.; Ensure hashCode() and equals() methods are consistent for custom objects.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor hash functions lead to excessive collisions and O(N) worst-case performance.; Inconsistent hashCode() and equals() can cause data retrieval failures.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

        // Calculate distances for each group of identical elements

            int size = indices.size();
