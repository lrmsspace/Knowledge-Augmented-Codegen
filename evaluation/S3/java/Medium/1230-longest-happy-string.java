// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-string/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// A string s is called happy if it satisfies the following conditions:
//
//
// 	s only contains the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
// 	s does not contain any of "aaa", "bbb", or "ccc" as a substring.
// 	s contains at most a occurrences of the letter 'a'.
// 	s contains at most b occurrences of the letter 'b'.
// 	s contains at most c occurrences of the letter 'c'.
//
//
// Given three integers a, b, and c, return the longest possible happy string. If there are multiple longest happy strings, return any of them. If there is no such string, return the empty string "".
//
// A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
//
// Example:
// Input: a = 1, b = 1, c = 7
// Output: "ccaccbcc"
// Explanation: "ccbccacc" would also be a correct answer.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= a, b, c <= 100
// 	a + b + c > 0

// - Data Compression (tree, heap, greedy, recursion, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to losslessly compress data by assigning shorter bit sequences to more frequent symbols, aiming for the shortest possible average code length. It is effective for data with non-uniform character distributions.
//   • Idea: Huffman coding is a greedy algorithm that constructs an optimal prefix code for a given set of symbols and their frequencies. It builds a binary tree (Huffman trie) by repeatedly merging the two nodes with the smallest frequencies, resulting in an encoding with O(N + K log K) time complexity, where N is input length and K is alphabet size.
//   • Invariants: The priority queue always contains valid Huffman nodes, each representing a subtree or a leaf character.; Every internal node in the Huffman tree has exactly two children, and its frequency is the sum of its children's frequencies.
//   • Tips: Use a min-priority queue to efficiently retrieve and combine the two lowest-frequency nodes.; Represent the Huffman tree explicitly to generate codes and for decoding.
//   • Pitfalls: The overhead of storing the Huffman tree or frequency table can negate compression benefits for small inputs.; Not truly optimal for all data types; it's a statistical compression method.
// - Priority Queues (heap, stack, heap-select)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently retrieve the element with the highest (or lowest) priority from a collection, especially when elements are added or removed frequently.
//   • Idea: A priority queue is a data structure that allows efficient retrieval of the element with the highest or lowest priority, and efficient insertion of new elements. Operations typically run in logarithmic time, O(log N).
//   • Invariants: The priority queue maintains the heap property: parent nodes are always greater than/equal to (or less than/equal to) their children.; For a K-selection problem, the priority queue contains at most K elements, representing the K largest/smallest seen so far.
//   • Tips: Use a min-priority queue to find the K largest elements by keeping at most K elements.; Use a max-priority queue to find the K smallest elements by keeping at most K elements.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing min-priority queue with max-priority queue for the desired extremum.; Inefficient underlying implementation leading to O(N) operations instead of O(log N).
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in a given collection of numbers. It's often applied in problems involving game theory or combinatorial analysis.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given sequence or set. It typically involves marking present numbers and then iterating from zero to find the first unmarked number, achieving O(N) or O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: All non-negative integers less than the current candidate MEX value have been found in the input sequence.; The data structure used for presence tracking accurately reflects which non-negative integers up to a certain bound are present.
//   • Tips: Use a boolean array or hash set for efficient presence checking.; The MEX value is at most N (for N elements) if all numbers are distinct and within [0, N-1].
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the case where all numbers from 0 to N-1 are present, meaning MEX is N.; Using an inefficient method for presence checking, leading to higher time complexity.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
