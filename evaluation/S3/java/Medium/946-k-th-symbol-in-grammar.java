//
// Problem Description:
// We build a table of n rows (1-indexed). We start by writing 0 in the 1st row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of 0 with 01, and each occurrence of 1 with 10.
//
//
// 	For example, for n = 3, the 1st row is 0, the 2nd row is 01, and the 3rd row is 0110.
//
//
// Given two integer n and k, return the kth (1-indexed) symbol in the nth row of a table of n rows.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 1, k = 1
// Output: 0
// Explanation: row 1: 0
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 30
// 	1 <= k <= 2n - 1

// - Josephus Problem (number, recursion, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when simulating a circular elimination process with a fixed step size, especially when seeking the survivor's position. It's particularly efficient for specific step sizes like two.
//   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the last remaining position in a circular arrangement after elements are eliminated at fixed intervals. The recursive solution for a step size of two has a logarithmic time complexity, O(log N), due to its divide-and-conquer nature.
//   • Invariants: The number of participants N is always positive in each recursive subproblem.; The returned position is always within the valid range [0, current N-1] (or [1, current N]).
//   • Tips: Base cases are crucial for recursive solutions, typically for N=1.; Observe patterns for specific step sizes, especially k=2, which has a simpler formula.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when converting between 0-indexed and 1-indexed results.; Incorrectly applying the position 'shift' after elements are eliminated in subproblems.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Josephus Problem (number, dp-1d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used to determine the position of the last remaining person in a circle where every k-th person is eliminated until only one remains. It models sequential removal processes in a circular arrangement.
//   • Idea: The Josephus Problem determines the position of the survivor in a circle of N people, where every K-th person is eliminated. The standard solution uses a recursive relation or dynamic programming, typically achieving O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The result J(n, k) represents the survivor's original 0-indexed position among n people.; Each recursive step J(n, k) correctly transforms the result from J(n-1, k) based on the k-th elimination.
//   • Tips: Use 0-indexing for a simpler and more elegant recursive formula.; Establish the base case for N=1 (the survivor is always 0 or 1).
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors when switching between 0-indexing and 1-indexing.; Incorrectly applying the modulo operator, especially with negative results in some languages.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
