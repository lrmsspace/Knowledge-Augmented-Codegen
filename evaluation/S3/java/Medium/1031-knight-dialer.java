//
// Problem Description:
// The chess knight has a unique movement, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an L). The possible movements of chess knight are shown in this diagram:
//
// A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:
//
// We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight can only stand on a numeric cell (i.e. blue cell).
//
// Given an integer n, return how many distinct phone numbers of length n we can dial.
//
// You are allowed to place the knight on any numeric cell initially and then you should perform n - 1 jumps to dial a number of length n. All jumps should be valid knight jumps.
//
// As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 1
// Output: 10
// Explanation: We need to dial a number of length 1, so placing the knight over any numeric cell of the 10 cells is sufficient.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 5000

// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, counting, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use when counting non-attacking piece placements on a grid, especially when the problem can be decomposed into independent subproblems based on board properties like diagonals.
//   • Idea: This algorithm employs 2D dynamic programming to count the total number of ways to place non-attacking bishops on a chessboard. It leverages the independence of placements on black and white squares/diagonals, achieving a polynomial time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any diagonal `i`, `D[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonal `i`.; Bishops placed on black diagonals do not attack bishops placed on white diagonals.
//   • Tips: Decompose the problem into independent subproblems for black and white squares/diagonals.; Identify the state for DP, typically `dp[diagonal_index][bishops_placed]`.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating the number of squares on each diagonal.; Overlapping bishops if diagonal definitions are not precise.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp)
//   • When to use: Use Digit DP to count numbers within a given range [a, b] that satisfy a property based on their digits. It's effective when the property can be checked digit by digit.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy specific properties related to their digits. It typically involves a recursive function with memoization, building numbers digit by digit, and has a complexity roughly proportional to (number of digits * state space).
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter accurately reflects if the current prefix matches the upper bound's prefix.; The `is_leading_zero` parameter correctly indicates if all preceding digits chosen were zero.
//   • Tips: Define the DP state carefully, including index, tight constraint, and leading zero flag.; Handle leading zeros correctly, as they can affect properties like sum or count of digits.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the 'tight' constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to account for leading zeros or mismanaging their impact on the property.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
