//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, nums1 and nums2, both having length n.
//
// You are allowed to perform a series of operations (possibly none).
//
// In an operation, you select an index i in the range [0, n - 1] and swap the values of nums1[i] and nums2[i].
//
// Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to satisfy the following conditions:
//
//
// 	nums1[n - 1] is equal to the maximum value among all elements of nums1, i.e., nums1[n - 1] = max(nums1[0], nums1[1], ..., nums1[n - 1]).
// 	nums2[n - 1] is equal to the maximum value among all elements of nums2, i.e., nums2[n - 1] = max(nums2[0], nums2[1], ..., nums2[n - 1]).
//
//
// Return an integer denoting the minimum number of operations needed to meet both conditions, or -1 if it is impossible to satisfy both conditions.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums1 = [1,2,7], nums2 = [4,5,3]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: In this example, an operation can be performed using index i = 2.
// When nums1[2] and nums2[2] are swapped, nums1 becomes [1,2,3] and nums2 becomes [4,5,7].
// Both conditions are now satisfied.
// It can be shown that the minimum number of operations needed to be performed is 1.
// So, the answer is 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == nums1.length == nums2.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= nums1[i] <= 109
// 	1 <= nums2[i] <= 109

// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
//   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
//   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
// - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
//   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
//   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
//   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
