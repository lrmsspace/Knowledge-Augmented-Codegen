// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-starting-from-leaf/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range [0, 25] representing the letters 'a' to 'z'.
//
// Return the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.
//
// As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller.
//
//
// 	For example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".
//
//
// A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]
// Output: "dba"
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 8500].
// 	0 <= Node.val <= 25
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use to uniquely encode a labeled tree into a sequence of numbers or reconstruct a labeled tree from such a sequence. It's valuable for counting labeled trees and problems involving tree generation.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code uniquely encodes a labeled tree into a sequence by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor. This process, which can be implemented in O(N log N) or O(N) time, continues until only two nodes remain.
//   • Invariants: The generated sequence contains `k` elements after `k` leaf removals.; All nodes with degree 1 are correctly identified as leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for O(1) degree updates.; Use a min-priority queue or a `next_leaf` pointer for efficient smallest leaf retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update neighbor degrees after removing a leaf.; Incorrectly identifying the next smallest leaf, especially when new leaves are formed.
// - Prüfer code (tree, heap, simulation, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when counting labeled trees or converting between a labeled tree and a unique sequence representation for combinatorial analysis. It provides a bijection for problems involving N labeled nodes.
//   • Idea: Prüfer code is a unique sequence of length N-2 that represents a labeled tree with N nodes. It is constructed by iteratively removing the smallest-labeled leaf and recording its neighbor, and can be reconstructed back into the tree.
//   • Invariants: The Prüfer sequence always contains N-2 elements for a tree with N nodes.; At each step of encoding, the removed node is a leaf with the smallest label among all current leaves.
//   • Tips: Maintain an array of node degrees for efficient updates.; Use a min-priority queue to quickly find the smallest-labeled leaf.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly updating node degrees after removal.; Off-by-one errors when dealing with 0-indexed vs. 1-indexed labels.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (array, min-window)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree efficiently for multiple queries. This approach is ideal when the tree is static and preprocessing is acceptable.
//   • Idea: This method finds the LCA by converting the problem into a Range Minimum Query on an Euler tour of the tree's depths. It preprocesses the tree in O(N log N) or O(N) time and answers queries in O(log N) or O(1) time.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour array correctly records nodes in DFS entry/exit order.; The depth array stores the correct depth for each node in the Euler tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a DFS to construct the Euler tour and depth array.; Store the first occurrence index of each node in the Euler tour.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly constructing the Euler tour or depth array.; Off-by-one errors when mapping Euler tour indices to original nodes.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
