// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-gold/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.
//
// Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:
//
//
// 	Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
// 	From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
// 	You can't visit the same cell more than once.
// 	Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
// 	You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
// Output: 24
// Explanation:
// [[0,6,0],
//  [5,8,7],
//  [0,9,0]]
// Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 15
// 	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
// 	There are at most 25 cells containing gold.

// - Depth-first search (graph, array, stack, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to explore all reachable vertices from a starting point or systematically visit all nodes in a graph or tree. It's suitable for problems requiring full exploration of a branch before backtracking.
//   • Idea: Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically using a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion).
//   • Invariants: Every node `v` in the graph is either visited or not yet visited.; The recursion stack (or explicit stack) always contains a path from the source node to the current node being explored.
//   • Tips: Use a `visited` array or set to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often cleaner for implementation, but iterative DFS with an explicit stack avoids recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited leads to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Backtracking Algorithm (graph, backtracking, recursion, dfs)
//   • When to use: Used when exploring multiple possibilities to find a solution incrementally, often involving undoing choices if they lead to a dead end.
//   • Idea: Backtracking is a problem-solving technique that incrementally builds a solution by trying options and undoing them upon reaching a dead end. It typically explores a search space in a depth-first manner, often resulting in exponential time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The current partial solution is valid up to the current decision point.; All choices made to reach the current state can be systematically undone.
//   • Tips: Define clear base cases for recursive termination.; Identify decision points and available choices at each step.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to undo changes (backtrack) after exploring a path.; Incorrectly defining base cases, leading to infinite recursion or wrong results.
// - Depth-first search (graph, array, stack, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS when you need to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, detect cycles, or perform topological sorting in a graph. It is suitable for problems requiring deep exploration before backtracking.
//   • Idea: Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically running in O(V + E) time for graphs.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently on the recursion stack (or explicit stack) are part of the current path from the source.; Once a node `v` is marked `visited`, it will not be processed again by the main traversal logic.
//   • Tips: Use a `visited` array or set to track explored nodes.; Pass the parent node in recursive calls to correctly detect cycles.
//   • Pitfalls: Risk of stack overflow for very deep graphs with recursive implementations.; Failure to use a `visited` array leads to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
