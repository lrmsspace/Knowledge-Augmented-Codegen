//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a positive integer n, representing an n x n city. You are also given a 2D grid buildings, where buildings[i] = [x, y] denotes a unique building located at coordinates [x, y].
//
// A building is covered if there is at least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below.
//
// Return the number of covered buildings.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2],[2,1],[2,3]]
//
// Output: 1
//
// Explanation:
//
//
// 	Only building [2,2] is covered as it has at least one building:
//
// 	
// 		above ([1,2])
// 		below ([3,2])
// 		left ([2,1])
// 		right ([2,3])
// 	
// 	
// 	Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= buildings.length <= 105 
// 	buildings[i] = [x, y]
// 	1 <= x, y <= n
// 	All coordinates of buildings are unique.

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.
// - Finding the largest zero submatrix (array, stack, monotonic-stack, max-window)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to find the largest rectangular submatrix composed entirely of zeros within a binary matrix. It efficiently reduces the 2D problem to a series of 1D largest rectangle in histogram problems.
//   • Idea: The algorithm transforms a 2D matrix problem into a series of 1D 'largest rectangle in histogram' problems, one for each row. It uses a monotonic stack to find the nearest smaller elements for each bar in O(N) time, leading to an overall O(N*M) complexity for the 2D problem.
//   • Invariants: The stack always stores indices of elements in strictly increasing order of their corresponding heights.; When an element is popped from the stack, the element below it is its nearest smaller element to the left.
//   • Tips: Precompute heights for each column, representing consecutive zeros upwards from the current row.; The 2D problem is effectively reduced to finding the largest rectangle in a histogram for each row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when using the stack (e.g., empty stack, end of array).; Off-by-one errors when calculating the width of the rectangle (k2 - k1 - 1).
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.

class Solution {
    public int countCoveredBuildings(int n, int[][] buildings) {
        // Step 1: Create sets to track the presence of buildings in each row and column
        Set<Integer> rowsWithBuildings = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Integer> colsWithBuildings = new HashSet<>();

        for (int[] building : buildings) {
            rowsWithBuildings.add(building[0]);
            colsWithBuildings.add(building[1]);
        }

        // Step 2: Count covered buildings
        int coveredCount = 0;
        for (int[] building : buildings) {
            int x = building[0];
            int y = building[1];

            // Check if there are buildings in all four directions
            boolean hasLeft = colsWithBuildings.contains(y - 1);
            boolean hasRight = colsWithBuildings.contains(y + 1);
            boolean hasAbove = rowsWithBuildings.contains(x - 1);
            boolean hasBelow = rowsWithBuildings.contains(x + 1);

            if (hasLeft && hasRight && hasAbove && hasBelow) {
                coveredCount++;
            }
        }
