// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
//
// The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
//
// Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.
//
// Example:
// Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
// Output: 20
// Explanation: 
//
// We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
// Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= points.length <= 1000
// 	-106 <= xi, yi <= 106
// 	All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.

// - Manhattan Distance (array, number, enumeration, max-window)
//   • When to use: When calculating distances on a grid where movement is restricted to cardinal directions, or when optimizing expressions involving sums of absolute differences of coordinates.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance, or L1 distance, measures the distance between two points as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates. It is commonly used to find optimal paths on a grid or to transform coordinate systems for specific optimizations, often with O(N) or O(N log N) complexity for common problems like farthest pair.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.; The maximum Manhattan distance between any two points is found by considering the maximum of (max(x+y) - min(x+y)) and (max(x-y) - min(x-y)) over all points.
//   • Tips: For 2D points (x, y), Manhattan distance can be transformed by rotating coordinates: (x', y') = (x+y, x-y).; After coordinate rotation, the Manhattan distance problem often simplifies to finding min/max values of the transformed coordinates.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing Manhattan distance with Euclidean distance (L2 distance) or Chebyshev distance (L-infinity).; Incorrectly applying coordinate rotation for problems not involving sums of absolute differences.
// - Manhattan Distance (geometry, graph, sweep-line, mst-kruskal, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use this when finding the Minimum Spanning Tree for points in a 2D plane where edge weights are Manhattan distances, or when a geometric problem can be simplified by transforming Manhattan to Chebyshev distance.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Tree for points in a 2D plane using Manhattan distance. It leverages a sweep-line approach to efficiently find nearest neighbors in specific octants, reducing the number of candidate edges for Kruskal's algorithm, achieving O(N log N) complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any point 's' in the active set, its nearest neighbor in the current octant has not yet been processed.; Points are processed in non-decreasing order of 'x + y' (or transformed coordinate), ensuring local optimality for distances.
//   • Tips: Consider transforming Manhattan distance problems into Chebyshev distance problems using (x+y, y-x) coordinates.; Divide the plane into 8 octants around each point to simplify nearest neighbor searches.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining or handling the 8 octants, especially near boundaries or for points with equal coordinates.; Inefficiently managing the 'active set' during the sweep-line, leading to higher than O(N log N) complexity.
// - Manhattan Distance (geometry, number, coordinate-compress)
//   • When to use: Use when calculating distance between two points on a grid where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical directions. It is also useful for problems involving maximizing or minimizing sums of absolute coordinate differences, often transformable to Chebyshev distance.
//   • Idea: Manhattan distance measures the sum of absolute differences of Cartesian coordinates between two points. It can be transformed into a Chebyshev distance problem by rotating coordinates, enabling efficient O(N) max/min distance calculations.
//   • Invariants: For any two points P1=(x1, y1) and P2=(x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is always non-negative.; The transformed points P1'=(x1+y1, y1-x1) and P2'=(x2+y2, y2-x2) satisfy Chebyshev(P1', P2') == Manhattan(P1, P2).
//   • Tips: Consider transforming to Chebyshev distance for max/min distance problems.; The transformation involves rotating coordinates: (x, y) -> (x+y, y-x).
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing with Euclidean distance, which allows diagonal movement.; Incorrectly applying coordinate transformation (e.g., wrong signs).
