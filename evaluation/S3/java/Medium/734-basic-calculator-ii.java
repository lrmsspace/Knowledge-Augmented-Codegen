// Problem Description:
// Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 
//
// The integer division should truncate toward zero.
//
// You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].
//
// Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "3+2*2"
// Output: 7
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
// 	s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
// 	s represents a valid expression.
// 	All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 231 - 1].
// 	The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

// - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: This algorithm is used to evaluate expressions given in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation) to compute their final numerical value.
//   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an expression in Reverse Polish Notation by processing elements sequentially. Numbers are pushed onto a stack, and operators pop two operands, compute, and push the result.
//   • Invariants: The stack always contains only numbers (operands or intermediate results).; For a valid RPN expression, the stack will have at least two elements when an operator is processed.
//   • Tips: Process the RPN expression from left to right, token by token.; Push numerical operands directly onto the stack.
//   • Pitfalls: Attempting to pop from an empty stack when an operator is encountered, indicating an invalid RPN expression.; Incorrect order of operands for non-commutative operations like subtraction or division.
// - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to evaluate an arithmetic expression given in infix notation, respecting operator precedence and parentheses. It is suitable for expressions with binary, left-associative operators.
//   • Idea: This algorithm evaluates an infix arithmetic expression using two stacks: one for operands and one for operators. It processes the expression from left to right, applying operator precedence and associativity rules to achieve an O(N) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The operand stack always contains valid numerical values or intermediate results.; The operator stack maintains operators such that operators with higher or equal precedence are processed before lower precedence ones.
//   • Tips: Clearly define operator precedence and associativity rules for all operators.; Use a separate stack for operands (numbers) and operators (including parentheses).
//   • Pitfalls: Misinterpreting operator precedence or associativity rules can lead to incorrect results.; Failure to handle mismatched or unbalanced parentheses can cause runtime errors.
// - Expression parsing (stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: When evaluating or converting arithmetic or logical expressions involving various operators, including unary and binary, and handling different associativities. It's useful for implementing calculators or compilers.
//   • Idea: This technique involves using stacks to parse and evaluate expressions, correctly handling operator precedence and associativity, including unary and right-associative operators. It typically processes expressions in O(N) time, where N is the expression length.
//   • Invariants: The operator stack always maintains operators in increasing order of precedence from bottom to top (excluding parentheses).; When processing an operand, it is immediately pushed onto the operand stack.
//   • Tips: Distinguish unary from binary operators based on context (e.g., preceding token).; Assign higher precedence to unary operators than most binary ones.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly identifying unary vs. binary operators based on context.; Failing to correctly implement operator precedence rules.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
