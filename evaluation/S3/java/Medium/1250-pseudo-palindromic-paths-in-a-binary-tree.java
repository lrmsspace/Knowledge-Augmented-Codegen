//
// Problem Description:
// Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.
//
// Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
// Output: 2 
// Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].
// 	1 <= Node.val <= 9

// - Depth First Search (tree, graph, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, or traverse tree-like structures. It's suitable for problems requiring exhaustive search or connectivity checks.
//   • Idea: Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It typically uses a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion) and has a time complexity of O(V + E) for graphs and O(V) for trees.
//   • Invariants: All nodes reachable from the starting node are eventually visited.; The visited set/array accurately tracks all nodes currently in the recursion stack or already fully explored.
//   • Tips: Use a visited set or array to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often the most natural way to implement DFS.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on very large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Depth-first search (graph, array, stack, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to explore all reachable vertices from a starting point or systematically visit all nodes in a graph or tree. It's suitable for problems requiring full exploration of a branch before backtracking.
//   • Idea: Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically using a stack (explicit or implicit via recursion).
//   • Invariants: Every node `v` in the graph is either visited or not yet visited.; The recursion stack (or explicit stack) always contains a path from the source node to the current node being explored.
//   • Tips: Use a `visited` array or set to prevent cycles and redundant work.; Recursion is often cleaner for implementation, but iterative DFS with an explicit stack avoids recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: Stack overflow can occur with deep recursion on large graphs.; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited leads to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.
// - Depth-first search (graph, array, stack, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use DFS when you need to explore all reachable nodes from a starting point, find paths, detect cycles, or perform topological sorting in a graph. It is suitable for problems requiring deep exploration before backtracking.
//   • Idea: Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically running in O(V + E) time for graphs.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently on the recursion stack (or explicit stack) are part of the current path from the source.; Once a node `v` is marked `visited`, it will not be processed again by the main traversal logic.
//   • Tips: Use a `visited` array or set to track explored nodes.; Pass the parent node in recursive calls to correctly detect cycles.
//   • Pitfalls: Risk of stack overflow for very deep graphs with recursive implementations.; Failure to use a `visited` array leads to infinite loops in cyclic graphs.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
