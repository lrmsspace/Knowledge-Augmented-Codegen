// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-of-operating-a-centennial-wheel/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola has room for up to four people. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you runningCost dollars.
//
// You are given an array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of new customers arriving just before the ith rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel i times before the customers[i] customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays boardingCost dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.
//
// You can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.
//
// Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.
// 1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.
// 2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.
// 3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $5 - 3 * $6 = $37.
// The highest profit was $37 after rotating the wheel 3 times.
//
// Constraints:
// n == customers.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	0 <= customers[i] <= 50
// 	1 <= boardingCost, runningCost <= 100

// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, number, simulation, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when determining the optimal sequence of jobs to minimize the total completion time (makespan) on two machines, with a fixed processing order (machine 1 then machine 2) for all jobs.
//   • Idea: This problem involves ordering N jobs, each with two processing times (one for each machine), to minimize the overall makespan. Johnson's rule provides an optimal greedy solution for this specific two-machine flow shop problem in O(N log N) or O(N) time.
//   • Invariants: All jobs processed so far maintain the optimal relative order determined by Johnson's rule.; The current makespan is the minimum possible for the jobs already scheduled.
//   • Tips: Sort jobs based on Johnson's rule criteria: jobs with min(a_i, b_i).; Prioritize jobs with shorter machine 1 times or longer machine 2 times for early scheduling.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying Johnson's rule to problems with more than two machines, where it is not optimal.; Incorrectly sorting jobs within the two partitioned sets.
// - Integration by Simpson's formula (number, interval, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when approximating definite integrals of functions that are sufficiently smooth over a given interval. It is effective for achieving good accuracy with a moderate number of subintervals.
//   • Idea: Simpson's formula approximates a definite integral by dividing the integration interval into an even number of subintervals and approximating the function over each pair of subintervals with a parabola. This method offers a higher order of accuracy compared to simpler rules, typically achieving O(N^4) accuracy for N subintervals.
//   • Invariants: The sum accumulates weighted function values for all processed subintervals.; The subinterval width 'h' remains constant across the entire integration range.
//   • Tips: Ensure the total number of subintervals (2n) is always even for the composite rule.; The weights for function evaluations follow a specific 1-4-2-4-...-2-4-1 pattern.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying the weighting coefficients, especially at the boundaries or interior points.; Using an odd number of subintervals, which invalidates the parabolic approximation for the composite rule.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
