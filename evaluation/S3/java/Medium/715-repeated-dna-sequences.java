// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
//
//
// 	For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
//
//
// When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
//
// Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
// Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 105
// 	s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
// - Rabin-Karp Algorithm for string matching (string, number, hashing, rolling-hash)
//   • When to use: To efficiently find all occurrences of a given pattern string within a larger text string, especially when multiple patterns might be searched or for average-case linear time performance.
//   • Idea: The Rabin-Karp algorithm finds occurrences of a pattern in a text by comparing their hash values, using a rolling hash function to efficiently update substring hashes. It achieves an average time complexity of O(|s| + |t|) and a worst-case of O(|s| * |t|).
//   • Invariants: The hash of the pattern string remains constant throughout the search.; The current window's hash value accurately represents the substring T[i...i+len(P)-1].
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime modulus to minimize hash collisions.; Select a suitable base (e.g., a prime greater than alphabet size) for polynomial hashing.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions can lead to false positives and degrade worst-case performance to O(MN).; Poor choice of base or modulus can significantly increase collision frequency.
// - String Hashing (string, number, hashing)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compare strings or substrings quickly, reducing comparison time from linear to constant. It is ideal for problems requiring frequent string equality checks or pattern matching across large texts.
//   • Idea: String hashing maps a string to an integer hash value, allowing for O(1) equality checks between strings or substrings. This technique relies on a hash function where equal strings must produce equal hashes, though the reverse is not guaranteed.
//   • Invariants: The hash of any prefix s[0...i] is correctly computed based on s[0...i-1] and s[i].; All characters processed up to the current index i contribute to the current hash value.
//   • Tips: Use a polynomial rolling hash function with a prime base and a large prime modulus.; Employ double hashing (two different bases/moduli) to significantly reduce collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Hash collisions: Different strings can produce the same hash, leading to false positives if not handled.; Poor choice of base or modulus can lead to more frequent collisions.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
