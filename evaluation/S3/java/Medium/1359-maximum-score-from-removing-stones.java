// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-stones/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes a​​​​​​, b,​​​​​​ and c​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).
//
// Given three integers a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.
//
// Example:
// Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
// Output: 6
// Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
// - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
// - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
// - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
// - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
// - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
// - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
// There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= a, b, c <= 105

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Scheduling jobs on two machines (array, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when optimizing the order of a sequence of tasks on two machines to minimize total idle time or makespan. It is typically applied when a greedy exchange argument can prove optimality.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines an optimal sequence for jobs on two machines by iteratively applying a greedy choice, often proven optimal via an exchange argument. It typically achieves an optimal solution in polynomial time, commonly O(N log N) or O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: The relative order of jobs already placed in the schedule is optimal.; The total idle time for the current prefix of scheduled jobs is correctly calculated.
//   • Tips: Focus on the local effect of swapping adjacent elements to derive the greedy criterion.; Identify a metric (e.g., total idle time or makespan) that changes predictably with swaps.
//   • Pitfalls: The greedy choice might not be globally optimal for problems with more than two machines.; Incorrectly defining the cost function for idle time or makespan can lead to suboptimal solutions.
// - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when a problem can be solved by making the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping this leads to a globally optimal solution. This strategy is often simpler and faster than dynamic programming.
//   • Idea: The greedy algorithm makes the best choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum, without reconsidering previous choices. Its time complexity is typically O(N log N) or O(N).
//   • Invariants: At each step, the chosen element is the best available according to the greedy criterion.; The partial solution constructed so far remains optimal for the subproblem considered.
//   • Tips: Prove correctness by exchange argument or induction.; Sort input data if it helps identify the greedy choice.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to prove the greedy choice property.; Making a locally optimal choice that prevents a global optimum.
// - Ternary Search (interval, number, binary-search, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use when searching for the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a unimodal function over a continuous or discrete interval. It efficiently narrows down the search space by evaluating the function at two internal points.
//   • Idea: Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that finds the extremum of a unimodal function within an interval by repeatedly reducing the search space by approximately one-third. It has a logarithmic time complexity, similar to binary search, but requires two function evaluations per step.
//   • Invariants: The extremum of the unimodal function lies within the current interval [l, r].; The function value at m1 is compared with the function value at m2.
//   • Tips: Handle discrete intervals by checking remaining points when interval size is small.; Consider Golden Section Search to reduce function evaluations per iteration.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly applying to non-unimodal functions.; Infinite loops if stopping condition for discrete intervals is not handled.
