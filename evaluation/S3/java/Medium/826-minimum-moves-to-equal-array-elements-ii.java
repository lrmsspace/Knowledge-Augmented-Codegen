// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.
//
// In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by 1.
//
// Test cases are designed so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3]
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):
// [1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, quickselect)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without fully sorting the entire data structure. It's particularly useful for large datasets where a full sort is too slow.
//   • Idea: Quickselect is a selection algorithm that finds the Kth smallest element in an unsorted list. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach similar to Quicksort, but only recurses on one side, achieving an average time complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to the pivot's value.; All elements to the right of the pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot's value.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot strategy, such as a random pivot, to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; Handle duplicate elements carefully during the partitioning step to ensure correctness.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Deep recursion without tail call optimization can cause stack overflow errors.

// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).

// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, quickselect, randomized)
//   • When to use: When you need to efficiently find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array. It is ideal when a full sort is unnecessary and average linear time performance is acceptable.
//   • Idea: Quickselect is a selection algorithm that finds the Kth smallest element in an unsorted list by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It achieves an average time complexity of O(N) and a worst-case complexity of O(N^2).
//   • Invariants: All elements in the left partition are less than or equal to the pivot element.; All elements in the right partition are greater than or equal to the pivot element.
//   • Tips: Shuffle the input array or choose a random pivot to achieve average O(N) performance.; The algorithm modifies the input array in place, so a copy might be needed if the original must be preserved.
//   • Pitfalls: A consistently bad pivot choice (e.g., always smallest/largest) leads to O(N^2) worst-case time.; Not suitable if the relative order of other elements needs to be preserved (it's not a stable algorithm).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
