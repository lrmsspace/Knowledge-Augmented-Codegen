// Problem Description:
// You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
//
// We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
// Output: 2
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= k <= n <= 100
// 	1 <= times.length <= 6000
// 	times[i].length == 3
// 	1 <= ui, vi <= n
// 	ui != vi
// 	0 <= wi <= 100
// 	All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

// - Dijkstra on sparse graphs (heap, queue, dijkstra)
//   • When to use: When you need to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights, especially efficient for sparse graphs.
//   • Idea: Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It uses a priority queue to greedily explore vertices, achieving O(E log V) complexity with a binary heap.
//   • Invariants: At the start of each iteration, dist[u] holds the shortest distance found so far from the source to u.; All vertices already extracted from the priority queue have their final shortest distance determined.
//   • Tips: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently retrieve the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance.; Initialize all distances to infinity and the source distance to zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not work correctly with negative edge weights; Bellman-Ford or SPFA is needed.; Forgetting to mark vertices as visited or handle duplicate entries in the priority queue can lead to incorrectness or TLE.
// - Finding a negative cycle in the graph (graph, array, bellman-ford)
//   • When to use: Use when a graph may contain negative edge weights and you need to find the shortest paths from a single source, or specifically to detect and identify negative cycles.
//   • Idea: The Bellman-Ford algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in a weighted graph, even with negative edge weights, and can detect negative cycles. It has a time complexity of O(VE).
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, dist[v] is the shortest path from the source to v using at most k edges.; If no negative cycle is reachable, dist[v] will be the true shortest path distance after V-1 iterations.
//   • Tips: Perform V-1 iterations for shortest path calculation, then one more for cycle detection.; A negative cycle exists if any distance can still be reduced in the V-th iteration.
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for graphs with only non-negative weights compared to Dijkstra's.; Does not directly work for undirected graphs with negative edges.
// - Dijkstra Algorithm (graph, array, dijkstra, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices in a graph. It is applicable when all edge weights are non-negative.
//   • Idea: Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest known distance, relaxing its outgoing edges, achieving O(V^2 + E) or O(E log V) complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any marked vertex v, d[v] holds the true shortest path distance from s to v.; For any unmarked vertex v, d[v] holds the shortest path distance from s to v using only marked intermediate vertices.
//   • Tips: Use a priority queue for sparse graphs to optimize performance to O(E log V).; Initialize distances to infinity for all vertices except the source, which is zero.
//   • Pitfalls: Dijkstra's algorithm does not work correctly with negative edge weights; use Bellman-Ford or SPFA instead.; Failing to use an efficient data structure (like a priority queue) for vertex selection can lead to O(V^2) performance on sparse graphs.
