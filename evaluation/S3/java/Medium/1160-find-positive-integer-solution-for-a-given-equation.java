// Problem Description:
// Given a callable function f(x, y) with a hidden formula and a value z, reverse engineer the formula and return all positive integer pairs x and y where f(x,y) == z. You may return the pairs in any order.
//
// While the exact formula is hidden, the function is monotonically increasing, i.e.:
//
//
// 	f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)
// 	f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)
//
//
// The function interface is defined like this:
//
//
// interface CustomFunction {
// public:
//   // Returns some positive integer f(x, y) for two positive integers x and y based on a formula.
//   int f(int x, int y);
// };
//
//
// We will judge your solution as follows:
//
//
// 	The judge has a list of 9 hidden implementations of CustomFunction, along with a way to generate an answer key of all valid pairs for a specific z.
// 	The judge will receive two inputs: a function_id (to determine which implementation to test your code with), and the target z.
// 	The judge will call your findSolution and compare your results with the answer key.
// 	If your results match the answer key, your solution will be Accepted.
//
// Example:
// Input: function_id = 1, z = 5
// Output: [[1,4],[2,3],[3,2],[4,1]]
// Explanation: The hidden formula for function_id = 1 is f(x, y) = x + y.
// The following positive integer values of x and y make f(x, y) equal to 5:
// x=1, y=4 -> f(1, 4) = 1 + 4 = 5.
// x=2, y=3 -> f(2, 3) = 2 + 3 = 5.
// x=3, y=2 -> f(3, 2) = 3 + 2 = 5.
// x=4, y=1 -> f(4, 1) = 4 + 1 = 5.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= function_id <= 9
// 	1 <= z <= 100
// 	It is guaranteed that the solutions of f(x, y) == z will be in the range 1 <= x, y <= 1000.
// 	It is also guaranteed that f(x, y) will fit in 32 bit signed integer if 1 <= x, y <= 1000.

// - Linear Diophantine Equation (number, interval, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find or count all integer solutions (x, y) for a linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, especially when solutions are constrained within specific intervals for x and y.
//   • Idea: This method finds all integer solutions to a linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c within given x and y intervals. It first finds a particular solution, then uses properties of the general solution to determine the valid range for x, and enumerates solutions in O(N) time where N is the number of solutions.
//   • Invariants: The current (x, y) pair always satisfies the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c.; The current x value is an integer and satisfies the effective bounds l_x <= x <= r_x.
//   • Tips: Pre-divide coefficients a, b, c by gcd(a, b) to simplify the equation.; Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find an initial particular solution (x0, y0).
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to check if c is divisible by gcd(a, b) before proceeding, leading to incorrect results.; Incorrectly applying the shifting logic for x and y bounds, resulting in an invalid solution range.
// - Generating all K-combinations (array, enumeration, greedy)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to iterate through all possible subsets of a fixed size K from a larger set, especially when a specific order like lexicographical is required.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique combinations of K elements from a set of N elements. It typically proceeds in lexicographical order, allowing for efficient enumeration of all C(N, K) possibilities.
//   • Invariants: The current combination C is always sorted: C[0] < C[1] < ... < C[K-1].; All elements C[i] are distinct and within the range [0, N-1] (assuming 0-indexed).
//   • Tips: Start with the smallest lexicographical combination (e.g., {1, 2, ..., K}).; To find the next combination, locate the rightmost element that can be incremented.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling boundary conditions when incrementing elements.; Duplicating combinations if not careful with the increment logic.
// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
