// Problem Description:
// Given an integer array nums, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:
//
//
// 	Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
// 	left and right are non-empty.
// 	left has the smallest possible size.
//
//
// Return the length of left after such a partitioning.
//
// Test cases are generated such that partitioning exists.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [5,0,3,8,6]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	0 <= nums[i] <= 106
// 	There is at least one valid answer for the given input.

// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, greedy, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the longest sequence of elements in a given array such that each element is greater than the preceding one, without changing their relative order. It's applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered subsets.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of an array where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using a greedy approach with binary search, or O(N^2) using dynamic programming.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array elements are always in strictly increasing order.; tails[i] stores the smallest possible ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.
//   • Tips: Prefer the O(N log N) greedy approach with binary search for better performance.; The 'tails' array in the greedy approach stores the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of a certain length.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing LIS with Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) or contiguous subarrays.; Incorrectly handling duplicate elements when 'strictly increasing' is required.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to find the maximum length of a subsequence where elements are strictly increasing. It is particularly efficient when optimizing the O(N^2) dynamic programming solution to O(N log N) using binary search.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the longest subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It can be solved with dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or optimized to O(N log N) using binary search.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array always stores the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The 'tails' array is always sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains an array 'tails' where 'tails[i]' is the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length 'i+1'.; Utilize binary search (e.g., `std::lower_bound`) to find the correct position for the current element in the 'tails' array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing a subsequence with a contiguous subarray, which is a common mistake.; Incorrectly updating the 'tails' array, leading to non-increasing subsequences or incorrect lengths.
// - Longest increasing subsequence (array, dp-1d, binary-search)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find the longest possible subsequence of a given sequence where elements are in strictly increasing order. It is applicable for optimizing problems involving ordered selections from a sequence.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(N^2) time or with a greedy approach using binary search in O(N log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The 'tails' array (or equivalent) is always sorted in increasing order.; For any index `i`, `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length `i+1` found so far.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) approach maintains a 'tails' array where tails[i] stores the smallest ending element of an increasing subsequence of length i+1.; Use binary search (specifically `lower_bound` for strictly increasing) to find the correct position to update the 'tails' array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray; elements do not need to be contiguous.; Incorrectly applying binary search (e.g., using `upper_bound` instead of `lower_bound` for strict increase).

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
