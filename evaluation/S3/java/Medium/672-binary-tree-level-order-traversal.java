// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
// Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
// 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Breadth-first search (graph, array, bfs, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or traversing a graph level by level to explore all reachable nodes. It is also suitable for finding connected components or checking reachability.
//   • Idea: Breadth-first search explores a graph layer by layer, finding the shortest path in terms of edges from a source node to all other reachable nodes. It typically runs in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or next level of traversal from the source.; All nodes already dequeued have been fully processed, and their unvisited neighbors have been enqueued.
//   • Tips: Use a queue to manage nodes to visit in a FIFO manner.; Mark nodes as visited immediately upon adding them to the queue to prevent redundant processing and cycles.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs or incorrect path lengths.; Not handling disconnected components if the goal is to traverse the entire graph.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, array, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path or minimum number of edges between nodes in an unweighted graph, or to explore a graph layer by layer. It is also suitable for finding shortest cycles or identifying all components of shortest paths.
//   • Idea: Breadth-first search systematically explores a graph level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of edges is found from a source node to all reachable nodes. It operates in O(V + E) time complexity for adjacency list representation.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at depth `k` or `k+1` from the source.; The distance recorded for any visited node is its shortest path length from the source.
//   • Tips: Run multiple BFS from different sources to find global properties like shortest cycles.; Maintain a distance array to record the shortest path length from the source to each node.
//   • Pitfalls: Applying BFS directly to weighted graphs will not yield shortest paths.; Failing to mark visited nodes can lead to infinite loops in cyclic graphs or incorrect path lengths.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, queue, array, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) from a source node to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph. It is also suitable for exploring a graph layer by layer.
//   • Idea: BFS systematically explores a graph level by level, starting from a source node, ensuring all nodes at a given distance are visited before moving to the next distance level. It operates in O(N + M) time for N vertices and M edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same or adjacent distance level from the source.; The 'used' array accurately reflects all nodes that have been added to the queue for processing.
//   • Tips: Always use a queue to maintain the order of nodes to visit.; Utilize a 'visited' array or set to prevent revisiting nodes and infinite loops.
//   • Pitfalls: Does not find shortest paths in weighted graphs unless weights are 0 or 1 (use Dijkstra for general weighted graphs).; Forgetting to mark nodes as visited can lead to incorrect results or TLE.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
