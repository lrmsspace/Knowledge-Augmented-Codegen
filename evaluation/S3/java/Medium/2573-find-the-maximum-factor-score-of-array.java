// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-factor-score-of-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums.
//
// The factor score of an array is defined as the product of the LCM and GCD of all elements of that array.
//
// Return the maximum factor score of nums after removing at most one element from it.
//
// Note that both the LCM and GCD of a single number are the number itself, and the factor score of an empty array is 0.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,4,8,16]
//
// Output: 64
//
// Explanation:
//
// On removing 2, the GCD of the rest of the elements is 4 while the LCM is 16, which gives a maximum factor score of 4 * 16 = 64.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 30
//

// - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, prefix-sum, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compute modular inverses for multiple numbers in an array or a range, especially when efficiency is critical, by leveraging prefix and suffix products to reduce inverse computations.
//   • Idea: This technique efficiently computes modular inverses for multiple numbers by transforming individual inverse calculations into a product of prefix, suffix, and a single overall inverse. It achieves O(N + log M) complexity for an array or O(M) for a range.
//   • Invariants: For 0 <= i < N, prefix_products[i] holds (arr[0] * ... * arr[i-1]) % m.; For 0 <= i < N, suffix_products[i] holds (arr[i+1] * ... * arr[N-1]) % m.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix products and suffix products of the array elements modulo m.; Calculate the modular inverse of the total product of all elements once using modular exponentiation.
//   • Pitfalls: Ensure all numbers for which an inverse is sought are coprime to the modulus m.; Watch for off-by-one errors when calculating prefix and suffix product indices.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent range queries and point/range updates are needed on an array, offering a balanced O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both operations. It's a good alternative when a segment tree is too complex or overkill.
//   • Idea: Sqrt decomposition divides an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N) to optimize range queries and updates. It achieves an O(sqrt(N)) time complexity for both query and update operations.
//   • Invariants: Each block maintains an up-to-date aggregate of its elements.; For any query, fully contained blocks are processed using their precomputed aggregates.
//   • Tips: Choose block size carefully, typically sqrt(N) for optimal balance.; Precompute block aggregates (sum, min, max) for efficient queries.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling partial blocks or boundary conditions.; Off-by-one errors in block indices or element indices within blocks.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
