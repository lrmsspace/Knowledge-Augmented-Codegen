// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/k-highest-ranked-items-within-a-price-range/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n that represents a map of the items in a shop. The integers in the grid represent the following:
//
//
// 	0 represents a wall that you cannot pass through.
// 	1 represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.
// 	All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells.
//
//
// It takes 1 step to travel between adjacent grid cells.
//
// You are also given integer arrays pricing and start where pricing = [low, high] and start = [row, col] indicates that you start at the position (row, col) and are interested only in items with a price in the range of [low, high] (inclusive). You are further given an integer k.
//
// You are interested in the positions of the k highest-ranked items whose prices are within the given price range. The rank is determined by the first of these criteria that is different:
//
//
// 	Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the start (shorter distance has a higher rank).
// 	Price (lower price has a higher rank, but it must be in the price range).
// 	The row number (smaller row number has a higher rank).
// 	The column number (smaller column number has a higher rank).
//
//
// Return the k highest-ranked items within the price range sorted by their rank (highest to lowest). If there are fewer than k reachable items within the price range, return all of them.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,0,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,5], start = [0,0], k = 3
// Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[2,1]]
// Explanation: You start at (0,0).
// With a price range of [2,5], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2).
// The ranks of these items are:
// - (0,1) with distance 1
// - (1,1) with distance 2
// - (2,1) with distance 3
// - (2,2) with distance 4
// Thus, the 3 highest ranked items in the price range are (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1).
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 105
// 	1 <= m * n <= 105
// 	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 105
// 	pricing.length == 2
// 	2 <= low <= high <= 105
// 	start.length == 2
// 	0 <= row <= m - 1
// 	0 <= col <= n - 1
// 	grid[row][col] > 0
// 	1 <= k <= m * n

// - 0-1 BFS (graph, array, dijkstra, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum costs without a full priority queue.
//   • Idea: A specialized Breadth-First Search variant that finds shortest paths in graphs with only 0 or 1 edge weights. It uses a deque to process 0-weight edges before 1-weight edges, achieving O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the deque have a distance value of either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.; Nodes pushed to the front of the deque always have a distance equal to the current node's distance.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque to maintain the order of processing nodes.; Add nodes reached via 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a standard queue instead of a deque.; Failing to initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the source.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, deque, array, 01-bfs)
//   • When to use: When finding the shortest path in a graph where edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1, or when minimizing operations where some operations are 'free' (cost 0) and others have a unit cost (cost 1).
//   • Idea: A graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source to all reachable nodes in a graph where edge weights are either 0 or 1. It uses a deque to prioritize 0-cost edges, achieving an optimal O(V + E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Nodes are added to the front of the deque if the edge weight is 0, and to the back if 1.; The distance `dist[u]` for any node `u` in the deque is either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.
//   • Tips: Use a deque: push 0-cost edges to the front, 1-cost edges to the back.; Mark nodes visited to avoid cycles and redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling visited states can lead to infinite loops or incorrect paths.; Forgetting to initialize distances properly before starting the traversal.
// - Multi source BFS (queue, graph, multi-source-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest distance from any of a given set of source nodes to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph or grid.
//   • Idea: Multi-source BFS explores a graph or grid by starting from multiple initial nodes simultaneously, finding the shortest path from any of these sources to all other reachable nodes. It operates in O(V + E) time for graphs or O(rows * cols) for grids.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same shortest distance level from any source.; When a node `u` is dequeued, `dist[u]` represents the finalized shortest distance from any source to `u`.
//   • Tips: Initialize distances for all sources to 0 and add them to the queue.; Use a `visited` array or set to prevent redundant processing of nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark initial sources as visited before adding to the queue.; Incorrectly initializing distances for non-source nodes (should be infinity or a large value).

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.

// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
