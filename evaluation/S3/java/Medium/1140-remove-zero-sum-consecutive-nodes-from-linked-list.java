// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-zero-sum-consecutive-nodes-from-linked-list/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.
//
// After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.
//
//  
// (Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of ListNode objects.)
//
// Example:
// Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
// Output: [3,1]
// Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
//
// Constraints:
// The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
// 	Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, ds, simulation)
//   • When to use: When you need dynamic collections that efficiently support insertions and deletions at specific points, or when memory usage needs to be precisely managed without contiguous memory allocation.
//   • Idea: This describes how fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, and bags can be implemented using linked lists, providing dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation. Operations typically achieve O(1) time complexity for additions and removals at the ends.
//   • Invariants: The head pointer always points to the first element, or is null if the list is empty.; The tail pointer always points to the last element, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Use a Node class to encapsulate data and a reference to the next element.; Maintain head and tail pointers for efficient O(1) operations in queues.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists.; Introducing 'loitering' by not nullifying references to removed objects, preventing garbage collection.
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, stack, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure is required, and dynamic size with efficient O(1) push and pop operations is crucial, especially without a fixed capacity.
//   • Idea: This describes implementing a stack using a singly linked list, where elements are added and removed from the head of the list. Both push and pop operations achieve O(1) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: The 'first' pointer always points to the top element of the stack, or is null if the stack is empty.; Each node's 'next' pointer correctly links to the subsequent element in the stack, maintaining the LIFO order.
//   • Tips: Maintain a 'first' pointer to the head of the linked list, representing the stack's top.; Push operation involves creating a new node, linking it to the current 'first', then updating 'first'.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle the empty stack case for pop, leading to `NoSuchElementException`.; Incorrectly updating the 'first' pointer during push or pop, which can break the list structure.
// - Linked-list implementations of collections (linked-list, queue, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent insertions or deletions at the beginning or end of a collection are required, or when the collection size is highly dynamic and unpredictable.
//   • Idea: Linked lists implement dynamic collections like queues and stacks by chaining nodes, each holding an item and a reference to the next node. Operations like adding or removing elements at the ends typically achieve O(1) time complexity, while random access is O(N).
//   • Invariants: The `first` pointer always references the head node, or is null if the list is empty.; The `last` pointer always references the tail node, or is null if the list is empty.
//   • Tips: Maintain separate `first` and `last` pointers for O(1) enqueue/dequeue operations.; Keep a `size` counter to provide O(1) size retrieval.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update `first` or `last` pointers correctly can lead to broken lists or memory leaks.; Null pointer exceptions are common when traversing or modifying an empty or partially traversed list.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
