// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/the-k-strongest-values-in-an-array/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of integers arr and an integer k.
//
// A value arr[i] is said to be stronger than a value arr[j] if |arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m| where m is the centre of the array.
// If |arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|, then arr[i] is said to be stronger than arr[j] if arr[i] > arr[j].
//
// Return a list of the strongest k values in the array. return the answer in any arbitrary order.
//
// The centre is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is n, the centre is the element in position ((n - 1) / 2) in the sorted list (0-indexed).
//
//
// 	For arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11], n = 5 and the centre is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11] and the centre is arr[m] where m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2. The centre is 6.
// 	For arr = [-7, 22, 17, 3], n = 4 and the centre is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22] and the centre is arr[m] where m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1. The centre is 3.
//
// Example:
// Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
// Output: [5,1]
// Explanation: Centre is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,1,4,2,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 1]. [1, 5] is also accepted answer.
// Please note that although |5 - 3| == |1 - 3| but 5 is stronger than 1 because 5 > 1.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= arr.length <= 105
// 	-105 <= arr[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= k <= arr.length

// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without sorting the entire dataset. It's ideal for problems requiring a specific order statistic in linear average time.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds the Kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array in expected linear time, O(N), by repeatedly partitioning the array around a pivot. It is a selection algorithm, conceptually similar to quicksort but only recursing on one side.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the chosen pivot are less than or equal to the pivot.; All elements to the right of the chosen pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot (e.g., random element) to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; The algorithm can be implemented iteratively to avoid potential recursion depth limits for very large inputs.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Off-by-one errors are common when translating K (1-based) to array indices (0-based).

// Kth order statistic in O(N) (array, quickselect)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Kth smallest or largest element in an unsorted array efficiently, without fully sorting the entire data structure. It's particularly useful for large datasets where a full sort is too slow.
//   • Idea: Quickselect is a selection algorithm that finds the Kth smallest element in an unsorted list. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach similar to Quicksort, but only recurses on one side, achieving an average time complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to the pivot's value.; All elements to the right of the pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot's value.
//   • Tips: Choose a good pivot strategy, such as a random pivot, to minimize the chance of worst-case performance.; Handle duplicate elements carefully during the partitioning step to ensure correctness.
//   • Pitfalls: Poor pivot selection can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2).; Deep recursion without tail call optimization can cause stack overflow errors.
// - Elementary Sorts (array, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Selection sort is simple but inefficient. It's suitable for very small datasets or educational purposes where simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.
//   • Idea: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(1).
//   • Invariants: The elements in the prefix of the array are sorted.; All elements in the sorted prefix are less than or equal to all elements in the unsorted suffix.
//   • Tips: Easy to understand and implement.; Performs a minimal number of swaps (exactly N-1 swaps).
//   • Pitfalls: Inefficient for large datasets due to O(N^2) time complexity.; Performance is not affected by the initial order of elements.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
