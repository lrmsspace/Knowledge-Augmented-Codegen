// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-submatrices-with-top-left-element-and-sum-less-than-k/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer matrix grid and an integer k.
//
// Return the number of submatrices that contain the top-left element of the grid, and have a sum less than or equal to k.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[7,6,3],[6,6,1]], k = 18
// Output: 4
// Explanation: There are only 4 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 18.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length 
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= n, m <= 1000 
// 	0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000
// 	1 <= k <= 109

// - Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum (matrix, array, dp-2d)
//   • When to use: Use this when you need to find a submatrix within a 2D array that yields the maximum or minimum possible sum of its elements. It's applicable when the problem can be reduced to multiple 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problems.
//   • Idea: This technique extends the 1D maximum/minimum subarray sum problem to two dimensions. It typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of row (or column) boundaries, reducing the problem to a 1D array, and then applying a 1D dynamic programming approach like Kadane's algorithm, resulting in an O(N^3) time complexity for an N x N matrix.
//   • Invariants: For any fixed pair of top and bottom row indices (r1, r2), the temporary 1D array correctly represents the sum of elements in columns between r1 and r2.; Kadane's algorithm, when applied to the temporary 1D array, correctly finds the maximum/minimum subarray sum for that specific row range.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums for rows to efficiently calculate column sums between fixed row boundaries.; The 2D problem can be reduced to multiple 1D problems by fixing two row indices and creating a temporary 1D array of column sums.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling negative numbers when searching for maximum sum; Kadane's algorithm correctly handles this, but custom logic might fail.; Off-by-one errors when defining submatrix boundaries or calculating sums for the 1D reduction.

//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries on a static array in O(1) time, after an initial O(N log N) preprocessing phase. It is particularly efficient for associative operations like sum, min, or max.
//   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes results for all possible range queries on a static array using a hierarchical block decomposition. It achieves O(N log N) construction time and space complexity, enabling O(1) query time for associative operations.
//   • Invariants: ST[k][i] stores the result for a range of length 2^k starting at i within its block.; For any level k, blocks are disjoint, but ranges within ST[k] can overlap with ranges in ST[k-1].
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values or highest set bit for efficient level determination.; Ensure the operation (e.g., sum, min, max) is associative for correct combination.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for arrays that require updates, as it's a static data structure.; Only works for associative operations; non-associative operations cannot be combined this way.
// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, sparse-table, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to perform O(1) range queries on a static array for an associative operation, after an O(N log N) preprocessing step.
//   • Idea: A data structure that precomputes answers for all possible range queries using an associative operation on a static array. It achieves O(1) query time and O(N log N) build time by storing prefix-like sums within logarithmically sized blocks.
//   • Invariants: For each level k, the array is partitioned into 2^k segments.; Within each segment, table[k][j] stores the result of the associative operation from j to the segment's midpoint (or midpoint to j).
//   • Tips: Ensure the operation is associative (e.g., min, max, sum, gcd, bitwise operations).; Preprocessing takes O(N log N) time and space.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for mutable arrays; updates require rebuilding the table.; Requires O(N log N) memory, which can be substantial for very large N.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
