// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/words-within-two-edits-of-dictionary/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two string arrays, queries and dictionary. All words in each array comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.
//
// In one edit you can take a word from queries, and change any letter in it to any other letter. Find all words from queries that, after a maximum of two edits, equal some word from dictionary.
//
// Return a list of all words from queries, that match with some word from dictionary after a maximum of two edits. Return the words in the same order they appear in queries.
//
// Example:
// Input: queries = ["word","note","ants","wood"], dictionary = ["wood","joke","moat"]
// Output: ["word","note","wood"]
// Explanation:
// - Changing the 'r' in "word" to 'o' allows it to equal the dictionary word "wood".
// - Changing the 'n' to 'j' and the 't' to 'k' in "note" changes it to "joke".
// - It would take more than 2 edits for "ants" to equal a dictionary word.
// - "wood" can remain unchanged (0 edits) and match the corresponding dictionary word.
// Thus, we return ["word","note","wood"].
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= queries.length, dictionary.length <= 100
// 	n == queries[i].length == dictionary[j].length
// 	1 <= n <= 100
// 	All queries[i] and dictionary[j] are composed of lowercase English letters.

// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.
// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, trie, aho-corasick, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns within a larger text efficiently. It's particularly effective for scenarios involving many patterns and potential overlaps.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses it to find all occurrences of these patterns in a text in a single pass. It operates in O(N + M + K) time, where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: All patterns in the dictionary are correctly represented in the trie (goto function).; The failure link `f[u]` for any state `u` points to the state representing the longest proper suffix of the string corresponding to `u` that is also a prefix of some pattern.
//   • Tips: Build the trie (goto function) first from all patterns.; Construct failure links using a BFS-like approach to ensure correct shortest suffix matching.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to propagate output matches through failure links can miss valid pattern occurrences.
// - Substring Search (string, array, two-pointers, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use KMP to efficiently find all occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text. It is particularly useful when the pattern might appear multiple times or when avoiding redundant text scans is crucial for performance.
//   • Idea: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm efficiently finds all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string by pre-processing the pattern to avoid re-scanning characters in the text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M), where N is text length and M is pattern length.
//   • Invariants: The `next` array is correctly pre-computed such that `next[k]` indicates the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...k-1]` that is also a suffix of `pattern[0...k-1]`.; During the search phase, `text[i-j ... i-1]` always matches `pattern[0 ... j-1]` if `j > 0`.
//   • Tips: Pre-compute the 'next' array (also known as LPS or failure array) for the pattern.; The 'next' array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix of the pattern up to that index.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the 'next' (LPS) array, especially handling the base cases or transitions.; Off-by-one errors in array indexing for either the text or pattern pointers.
