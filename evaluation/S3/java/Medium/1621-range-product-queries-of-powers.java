// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/range-product-queries-of-powers/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a positive integer n, there exists a 0-indexed array called powers, composed of the minimum number of powers of 2 that sum to n. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and there is only one way to form the array.
//
// You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array queries, where queries[i] = [lefti, righti]. Each queries[i] represents a query where you have to find the product of all powers[j] with lefti <= j <= righti.
//
// Return an array answers, equal in length to queries, where answers[i] is the answer to the ith query. Since the answer to the ith query may be too large, each answers[i] should be returned modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 15, queries = [[0,1],[2,2],[0,3]]
// Output: [2,4,64]
// Explanation:
// For n = 15, powers = [1,2,4,8]. It can be shown that powers cannot be a smaller size.
// Answer to 1st query: powers[0] * powers[1] = 1 * 2 = 2.
// Answer to 2nd query: powers[2] = 4.
// Answer to 3rd query: powers[0] * powers[1] * powers[2] * powers[3] = 1 * 2 * 4 * 8 = 64.
// Each answer modulo 109 + 7 yields the same answer, so [2,4,64] is returned.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 109
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
// 	0 <= starti <= endi < powers.length

// - Modular Multiplicative Inverse (array, number, prefix-sum, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to compute modular inverses for multiple numbers in an array or a range, especially when efficiency is critical, by leveraging prefix and suffix products to reduce inverse computations.
//   • Idea: This technique efficiently computes modular inverses for multiple numbers by transforming individual inverse calculations into a product of prefix, suffix, and a single overall inverse. It achieves O(N + log M) complexity for an array or O(M) for a range.
//   • Invariants: For 0 <= i < N, prefix_products[i] holds (arr[0] * ... * arr[i-1]) % m.; For 0 <= i < N, suffix_products[i] holds (arr[i+1] * ... * arr[N-1]) % m.
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix products and suffix products of the array elements modulo m.; Calculate the modular inverse of the total product of all elements once using modular exponentiation.
//   • Pitfalls: Ensure all numbers for which an inverse is sought are coprime to the modulus m.; Watch for off-by-one errors when calculating prefix and suffix product indices.
// - Binary Exponentiation by Factoring (number, counting, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when performing modular exponentiation for an odd base modulo a power of two, especially when dealing with specific logarithmic-like functions or inverses in this modulus.
//   • Idea: This technique computes modular exponentiation for an odd base modulo a power of two by factoring the exponent or its inverse into a product of terms like (2^n+1). It leverages bit manipulation to efficiently find this factorization, allowing for O(d) or O(d log d) complexity where d is the exponent of the modulus.
//   • Invariants: During the iterative process to find $x^{-1} \pmod{2^d}$, the current value of $x$ is always odd.; After processing bit $n$, the $n$-th bit of the current $x$ (for $x^{-1}$ calculation) is zero, and lower bits are unchanged.
//   • Tips: Precompute $4L(2^n+1)$ values for efficiency.; Leverage bitwise operations for multiplying by $2^n+1$ (e.g., x = x + (x << n)).
//   • Pitfalls: This method is specific to odd bases and moduli of the form $2^d$; it's not a general modular exponentiation.; Careful handling of negative results from $4L(x^{-1})$ when working with modular arithmetic.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers up to a given limit that satisfy a specific bit pattern constraint, particularly when the limit is small enough for direct iteration and checking.
//   • Idea: This approach iterates through every non-negative integer from 0 up to the given limit num. For each integer, it simulates checking its binary representation to determine if it contains any two consecutive '1's.
//   • Invariants: count stores the number of integers k (where 0 <= k < i) that do not have consecutive ones.; All integers j such that 0 <= j < i have been processed.
//   • Tips: Use bitwise operations like (i & (i >> 1)) to efficiently detect consecutive ones.; Remember to include 0 in the count as it satisfies the condition (no consecutive ones).
//   • Pitfalls: Performance degradation for large num due to linear scan and per-number bit check.; Incorrectly handling the upper bound of the iteration (e.g., i < num instead of i <= num).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
