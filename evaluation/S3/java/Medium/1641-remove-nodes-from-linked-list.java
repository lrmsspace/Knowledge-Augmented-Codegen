// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nodes-from-linked-list/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the head of a linked list.
//
// Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.
//
// Return the head of the modified linked list.
//
// Example:
// Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8]
// Output: [13,8]
// Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.
// - Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
// - Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
// - Node 8 is to the right of node 3.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 105].
// 	1 <= Node.val <= 105
//
// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - Binary Search Trees
//  (tree, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to store ordered data that allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion while maintaining sorted order. It's suitable for dynamic datasets where elements frequently change.
//   • Idea: A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree where keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key, and keys in the right subtree are larger. Operations like search, insert, and delete typically run in O(log N) average time and O(N) worst-case.
//   • Invariants: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than its key.; For any node, all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than its key.
//   • Tips: Maintain the BST property: left child < parent < right child.; Recursion simplifies many operations like search, insert, and traversal.
//   • Pitfalls: Unbalanced trees can degrade performance to O(N) for all operations.; Incorrect handling of duplicate keys can break BST properties or lead to data loss.
// - Quicksort (array, two-pointers, randomized)
//   • When to use: Use Quicksort for efficient in-place sorting of arrays, especially when average-case performance and cache efficiency are prioritized. It is suitable for large datasets where memory usage is a concern.
//   • Idea: Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions an array around a pivot element, then recursively sorts the two resulting subarrays. Its average time complexity is O(N log N), but can degrade to O(N^2) in the worst case.
//   • Invariants: All elements to the left of the `lt` pointer are less than the pivot value.; All elements to the right of the `gt` pointer are greater than the pivot value.
//   • Tips: Randomly shuffle the input or choose a random pivot to ensure average-case performance.; Employ 3-way partitioning to efficiently handle duplicate keys and avoid quadratic worst-case scenarios.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to handle duplicate keys can lead to quadratic time complexity.; Incorrect pointer crossing logic can cause infinite loops or array out-of-bounds errors.
// - Treap (Cartesian tree) (tree, recursion, binary-search)
//   • When to use: When you need a self-balancing binary search tree that supports efficient split and merge operations, often used for dynamic set management or range queries on mutable data.
//   • Idea: A Treap is a randomized binary search tree that maintains both BST properties on keys and heap properties on priorities (randomly assigned). It supports efficient operations like split and merge, typically with an average time complexity of O(log N).
//   • Invariants: For any node, its key is greater than or equal to all keys in its left subtree.; For any node, its key is less than all keys in its right subtree.
//   • Tips: Understand the recursive nature of Split and Merge operations.; Randomly assign priorities (Y values) to ensure probabilistic balancing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect handling of null pointers or empty subtrees in recursion.; Forgetting to update parent pointers or root pointers after operations.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
