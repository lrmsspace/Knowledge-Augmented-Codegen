// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
//
// Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
// Output: true
// Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 300
// 	1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
// 	s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
// 	All the strings of wordDict are unique.

// - Tries (trie, tree, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing a collection of strings and requiring efficient prefix-based operations like search, insertion, deletion, or finding the longest common prefix.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where nodes represent characters and paths from the root represent strings. Operations like insertion, search, and deletion typically take O(L) time, where L is the length of the key.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node's children pointers correspond to the next character in a string.
//   • Tips: Mark nodes as 'end of word' to distinguish prefixes from complete words.; Use an array for children pointers if the alphabet size is small and fixed (e.g., ASCII).
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or very deep tries due to many empty child pointers.; Deletion can be complex, requiring careful handling of nodes that are part of other words.
// - Tries (trie, array, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when managing string keys in a symbol table and needing efficient prefix, wildcard, or longest prefix matching operations, offering flexibility beyond binary search trees and speed comparable to hashing.
//   • Idea: A trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where keys are typically strings. It allows for efficient retrieval of keys based on their prefixes, achieving O(L) time complexity for operations, where L is the key length.
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node represents a unique prefix.; A node exists only if it is part of at least one stored key.
//   • Tips: Choose an appropriate branching factor (R) based on the alphabet size.; Represent children using arrays for fixed alphabets or hash maps for sparse ones.
//   • Pitfalls: High memory consumption for large alphabets or sparse data.; Deletion of keys can be complex, requiring careful handling of empty branches.
// - Aho-Corasick algorithm (trie, array, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of multiple patterns within a larger text efficiently. It's particularly effective when patterns can overlap or share prefixes.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a set of patterns using a trie and failure links, enabling efficient simultaneous search for all patterns in a text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K).
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node in the trie represents a unique prefix of at least one pattern.; After processing a character, the current automaton state corresponds to the longest suffix of the processed text that is also a prefix of some pattern.
//   • Tips: Construct the trie from all patterns first, then compute failure links.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like traversal from the root.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly computing failure links, especially for nodes at depth 1 or for non-existent transitions.; Failing to implement output links, leading to missed matches for patterns that are suffixes of others.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

        dp[0] = true; // Base case: empty string can be segmented

        for (int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (dp[j] && wordSet.contains(s.substring(j, i))) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break; // No need to check further if we found a valid segmentation
