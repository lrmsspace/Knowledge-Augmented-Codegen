// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-arrays-similar/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two positive integer arrays nums and target, of the same length.
//
// In one operation, you can choose any two distinct indices i and j where 0 <= i, j < nums.length and:
//
//
// 	set nums[i] = nums[i] + 2 and
// 	set nums[j] = nums[j] - 2.
//
//
// Two arrays are considered to be similar if the frequency of each element is the same.
//
// Return the minimum number of operations required to make nums similar to target. The test cases are generated such that nums can always be similar to target.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [8,12,6], target = [2,14,10]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: It is possible to make nums similar to target in two operations:
// - Choose i = 0 and j = 2, nums = [10,12,4].
// - Choose i = 1 and j = 2, nums = [10,14,2].
// It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations needed.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length == target.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i], target[i] <= 106
// 	It is possible to make nums similar to target.

// - Finding intersection of two segments (geometry, array, enumeration, two-pointers)
//   • When to use: Use this to determine if two line segments intersect and, if so, find the intersection point or the overlapping segment. It is useful for collision detection and computational geometry problems.
//   • Idea: This algorithm determines the intersection of two line segments by first handling parallel or collinear cases, then calculating the intersection point if lines are not parallel. It typically involves O(1) time complexity for a fixed number of segments.
//   • Invariants: Before checking for intersection, both segments are valid (non-degenerate or single points).; For non-parallel lines, the intersection point of their infinite extensions is uniquely determined.
//   • Tips: Handle general line intersection using parametric equations or cross products.; Project segments onto X and Y axes to check for overlap in collinear cases.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling edge cases like segments sharing an endpoint or being single points.; Failing to distinguish between parallel and collinear segments.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - kth-largest-element-in-an-array (array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use Merge Sort when a stable, guaranteed O(N log N) time complexity is required, especially for large datasets or linked lists where random access is costly.
//   • Idea: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N).
//   • Invariants: Each sub-array passed to merge is sorted.; The merge operation combines two sorted sub-arrays into a single sorted array.
//   • Tips: Implement the merge step carefully to maintain stability.; Consider iterative implementation to avoid recursion depth limits.
//   • Pitfalls: High space complexity due to auxiliary arrays.; Overhead of recursion can be significant for small inputs.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
