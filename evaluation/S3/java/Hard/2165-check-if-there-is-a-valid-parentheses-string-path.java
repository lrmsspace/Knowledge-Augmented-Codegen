//
// Problem Description:
// A parentheses string is a non-empty string consisting only of '(' and ')'. It is valid if any of the following conditions is true:
//
//
// 	It is ().
// 	It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid parentheses strings.
// 	It can be written as (A), where A is a valid parentheses string.
//
//
// You are given an m x n matrix of parentheses grid. A valid parentheses string path in the grid is a path satisfying all of the following conditions:
//
//
// 	The path starts from the upper left cell (0, 0).
// 	The path ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1).
// 	The path only ever moves down or right.
// 	The resulting parentheses string formed by the path is valid.
//
//
// Return true if there exists a valid parentheses string path in the grid. Otherwise, return false.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [["(","(","("],[")","(",")"],["(","(",")"],["(","(",")"]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: The above diagram shows two possible paths that form valid parentheses strings.
// The first path shown results in the valid parentheses string "()(())".
// The second path shown results in the valid parentheses string "((()))".
// Note that there may be other valid parentheses string paths.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 100
// 	grid[i][j] is either '(' or ')'.

// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Balanced bracket sequences (number, counting)
//   • When to use: Use this when verifying if a sequence of delimiters is correctly nested and balanced. It is also applicable for counting or generating all possible valid sequences of a given length.
//   • Idea: This algorithm involves checking if a sequence of opening and closing delimiters is properly matched and nested, or enumerating such sequences. Validation typically uses a stack in O(N) time, while generation often involves backtracking with O(Catalan(N)) complexity.
//   • Invariants: The stack contains only opening delimiters that are yet to be matched.; The balance counter (open - close) is never negative at any point during traversal.
//   • Tips: Use a stack to track unmatched opening delimiters for validation.; Maintain a balance counter (increment for open, decrement for close) for a simpler check.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to check if the stack is empty after processing the entire sequence.; Allowing a closing delimiter when no matching opening delimiter is available (empty stack or mismatch).
// - Placing Bishops on a Chessboard (array, matrix, dp-2d, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use this approach for counting arrangements of non-attacking pieces on a grid, particularly when piece movement is restricted to specific geometric lines like diagonals. It is effective when constraints allow for independent processing of subsets of the grid.
//   • Idea: This method employs 2D dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place bishops on a chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other. It leverages the property that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color, processing diagonals iteratively to build up solutions in polynomial time.
//   • Invariants: All bishops placed on diagonals with index less than `i` do not attack each other.; The count `D[i][j]` correctly reflects all valid placements of `j` bishops on diagonals up to `i` of the same color.
//   • Tips: Exploit problem-specific constraints, such as bishop movement along diagonals, to simplify state definitions.; Decompose the problem by processing diagonals of the same color independently to avoid complex interactions.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling diagonal numbering or miscalculating the number of squares in a diagonal.; Off-by-one errors when determining the number of available squares for placing a bishop on a diagonal.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
