// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-segment-sum-after-removals/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums and removeQueries, both of length n. For the ith query, the element in nums at the index removeQueries[i] is removed, splitting nums into different segments.
//
// A segment is a contiguous sequence of positive integers in nums. A segment sum is the sum of every element in a segment.
//
// Return an integer array answer, of length n, where answer[i] is the maximum segment sum after applying the ith removal.
//
// Note: The same index will not be removed more than once.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]
// Output: [14,7,2,2,0]
// Explanation: Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
// Query 1: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,2,5,6,1] and the maximum segment sum is 14 for segment [2,5,6,1].
// Query 2: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [0,2,5,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 7 for segment [2,5].
// Query 3: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
// Query 4: Remove the 4th element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
// Query 5: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
// Finally, we return [14,7,2,2,0].
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length == removeQueries.length
// 	1 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
// 	0 <= removeQueries[i] < n
// 	All the values of removeQueries are unique.

// - Range Minimum Query (array, ds, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when range minimum queries are needed on an array where elements can be dynamically removed or merged, and Union-Find is employed to manage the active state or connectivity of indices.
//   • Idea: Union-Find can be adapted to assist in range minimum queries, particularly when elements are dynamically removed or merged. It helps maintain connectivity of active elements or segments, allowing efficient traversal to find the minimum among available items, often with near-constant amortized time per Union-Find operation.
//   • Invariants: The `find` operation correctly returns the canonical representative for any element `i`.; Each set in the Union-Find structure maintains a property (e.g., minimum value, next available index) relevant to its merged elements.
//   • Tips: Utilize path compression and union by rank/size for optimal Union-Find performance.; Store relevant properties (e.g., minimum value, next available index) within the representative of each set.
//   • Pitfalls: Union-Find alone does not directly provide range minimums; it typically manages connectivity or availability.; Naive iteration through active elements found by Union-Find can be too slow for large ranges.
// - Sqrt Decomposition (array, enumeration, difference-array)
//   • When to use: Efficiently calculate sums or properties over various ranges in a static array. Useful for many range queries or when combining range updates with point queries.
//   • Idea: Prefix sums allow O(1) range sum queries after O(N) preprocessing. Difference arrays enable O(1) range updates and O(N) point queries after O(N) reconstruction.
//   • Invariants: The prefix sum array P[i] stores the sum of elements from A[0] to A[i-1].; The difference array D[i] stores A[i] - A[i-1] (for i > 0).
//   • Tips: Precompute prefix sums to answer range sum queries in constant time.; Use a difference array to apply range updates efficiently.
//   • Pitfalls: Off-by-one errors in range boundaries for prefix sums.; Forgetting to initialize the difference array correctly (e.g., diff[0] = arr[0] for 0-indexed).
// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, number, sparse-table, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries on a static array in O(1) time, after an initial O(N log N) preprocessing phase. It is particularly efficient for associative operations like sum, min, or max.
//   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes results for all possible range queries on a static array using a hierarchical block decomposition. It achieves O(N log N) construction time and space complexity, enabling O(1) query time for associative operations.
//   • Invariants: ST[k][i] stores the result for a range of length 2^k starting at i within its block.; For any level k, blocks are disjoint, but ranges within ST[k] can overlap with ranges in ST[k-1].
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values or highest set bit for efficient level determination.; Ensure the operation (e.g., sum, min, max) is associative for correct combination.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for arrays that require updates, as it's a static data structure.; Only works for associative operations; non-associative operations cannot be combined this way.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
