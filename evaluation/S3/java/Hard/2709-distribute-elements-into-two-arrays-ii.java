// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-elements-into-two-arrays-ii/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 1-indexed array of integers nums of length n.
//
// We define a function greaterCount such that greaterCount(arr, val) returns the number of elements in arr that are strictly greater than val.
//
// You need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays arr1 and arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1. In the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith operation:
//
//
// 	If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) > greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to arr1.
// 	If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) < greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to arr2.
// 	If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) == greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to the array with a lesser number of elements.
// 	If there is still a tie, append nums[i] to arr1.
//
//
// The array result is formed by concatenating the arrays arr1 and arr2. For example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6], then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6].
//
// Return the integer array result.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,1,3,3]
// Output: [2,3,1,3]
// Explanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [2] and arr2 = [1].
// In the 3rd operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is zero in both arrays. Also, the lengths are equal, hence, append nums[3] to arr1.
// In the 4th operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is zero in both arrays. As the length of arr2 is lesser, hence, append nums[4] to arr2.
// After 4 operations, arr1 = [2,3] and arr2 = [1,3].
// Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [2,3,1,3].
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 109

// - Disjoint Sparse Table tutorial (array, ds, number, sparse-table, counting)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer range queries on a static array in O(1) time, after an initial O(N log N) preprocessing phase. It is particularly efficient for associative operations like sum, min, or max.
//   • Idea: A Disjoint Sparse Table is a data structure that precomputes results for all possible range queries on a static array using a hierarchical block decomposition. It achieves O(N log N) construction time and space complexity, enabling O(1) query time for associative operations.
//   • Invariants: ST[k][i] stores the result for a range of length 2^k starting at i within its block.; For any level k, blocks are disjoint, but ranges within ST[k] can overlap with ranges in ST[k-1].
//   • Tips: Precompute log2 values or highest set bit for efficient level determination.; Ensure the operation (e.g., sum, min, max) is associative for correct combination.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for arrays that require updates, as it's a static data structure.; Only works for associative operations; non-associative operations cannot be combined this way.
// - MEX (minimal excluded) of a sequence (ds, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently find the smallest non-negative integer not present in a dynamic sequence or range, supporting both updates and queries in logarithmic time.
//   • Idea: This technique finds the Minimal Excluded (MEX) value in a sequence by maintaining counts of distinct elements in ranges using a specialized data structure, typically a segment tree. It supports both updates and queries in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each segment tree node accurately reflects the count of distinct numbers within its corresponding range.; If a range [L, R) contains R-L distinct numbers, then all integers from L to R-1 are present.
//   • Tips: Implement a segment tree where each node stores the count of distinct numbers in its range.; The binary search for MEX checks if a range [0, k) contains k distinct numbers to decide which child to traverse.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly calculating distinct counts in segment tree nodes, especially after updates.; Off-by-one errors when comparing the number of distinct elements with the expected count for a full range.
// - Longest Increasing Subsequence (array, coordinate-compress, segment-tree, dp-1d)
//   • When to use: Use when finding the maximum length of a subsequence where elements must be strictly increasing. It is applicable for problems requiring optimal substructure on sequences with an increasing property.
//   • Idea: The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem finds the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are in increasing order. It can be solved in O(N log N) time using dynamic programming with binary search or a segment tree with coordinate compression.
//   • Invariants: The `dp` array (or segment tree) stores information about the smallest ending element for increasing subsequences of various lengths.; The `dp` array, if used, remains sorted in strictly increasing order.
//   • Tips: The O(N log N) solution uses a `dp` array storing the smallest ending element for all increasing subsequences of a given length.; Binary search (`lower_bound`) efficiently finds the correct position to update in the `dp` array.
//   • Pitfalls: Confusing subsequence with subarray, which requires contiguous elements.; Incorrectly handling duplicates; LIS typically requires strictly increasing elements.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
