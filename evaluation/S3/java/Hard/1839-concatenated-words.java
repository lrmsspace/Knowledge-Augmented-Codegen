// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenated-words/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.
//
// A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words (not necessarily distinct) in the given array.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
// Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
// Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
// "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
// "ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 104
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 30
// 	words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
// 	All the strings of words are unique.
// 	1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 105

// - Aho-Corasick Algorithm for Pattern Searching (string, array, aho-corasick, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of patterns (a dictionary) within a larger text efficiently. It is particularly effective for scenarios with many patterns or long texts where patterns might overlap.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a dictionary of patterns, then uses this automaton to search for all pattern occurrences in a text in a single pass. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K) where N is text length, M is total pattern length, and K is total matches.
//   • Invariants: The trie structure correctly represents all prefixes of all patterns in the dictionary.; Each node's failure link points to the longest proper suffix of the string ending at that node which is also a prefix in the trie.
//   • Tips: Build the trie first from all patterns, marking terminal nodes.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like approach, similar to KMP's LPS array.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building failure links can lead to missed matches or infinite loops.; Forgetting to handle output links (dictionary links) will miss patterns found via failure transitions.
// - Aho-Corasick algorithm (trie, array, trie-match)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find all occurrences of a fixed set of multiple patterns within a larger text efficiently. It's particularly effective when patterns can overlap or share prefixes.
//   • Idea: The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a finite automaton from a set of patterns using a trie and failure links, enabling efficient simultaneous search for all patterns in a text. It achieves a time complexity of O(N + M + K).
//   • Invariants: Every path from the root to a node in the trie represents a unique prefix of at least one pattern.; After processing a character, the current automaton state corresponds to the longest suffix of the processed text that is also a prefix of some pattern.
//   • Tips: Construct the trie from all patterns first, then compute failure links.; Compute failure links using a BFS-like traversal from the root.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly computing failure links, especially for nodes at depth 1 or for non-existent transitions.; Failing to implement output links, leading to missed matches for patterns that are suffixes of others.
// - Suffix Array (string, array, merge-sort)
//   • When to use: Use when needing to efficiently query properties of all suffixes or substrings of a given text, especially for pattern matching or finding repeated structures. It is particularly useful for problems requiring lexicographical ordering of all suffixes.
//   • Idea: A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a given string, storing their starting indices. It enables efficient string operations like pattern searching and finding longest common prefixes, typically constructed in O(N log N) time.
//   • Invariants: After k iterations, suffixes are sorted correctly up to a certain length (e.g., 2^k).; All suffixes of the original string are represented by their starting indices in the array.
//   • Tips: Append a unique sentinel character (e.g., '$') smaller than any other character to the string.; Utilize the LCP array, often built alongside, for advanced string queries and optimizations.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive sorting of suffixes by string comparison leads to an inefficient O(N^2 log N) complexity.; High memory usage for very long strings due to storing all suffixes implicitly or explicitly.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
