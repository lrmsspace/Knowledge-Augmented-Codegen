// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer n and an undirected, weighted tree rooted at node 1 with n nodes numbered from 1 to n. This is represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates an undirected edge from node ui to vi with weight wi.
//
// You are also given a 2D integer array queries of length q, where each queries[i] is either:
//
//
// 	[1, u, v, w'] – Update the weight of the edge between nodes u and v to w', where (u, v) is guaranteed to be an edge present in edges.
// 	[2, x] – Compute the shortest path distance from the root node 1 to node x.
//
//
// Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the shortest path distance from node 1 to x for the ith query of [2, x].
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 2, edges = [[1,2,7]], queries = [[2,2],[1,1,2,4],[2,2]]
//
// Output: [7,4]
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
//
// 	Query [2,2]: The shortest path from root node 1 to node 2 is 7.
// 	Query [1,1,2,4]: The weight of edge (1,2) changes from 7 to 4.
// 	Query [2,2]: The shortest path from root node 1 to node 2 is 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 105
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i] == [ui, vi, wi]
// 	1 <= ui, vi <= n
// 	1 <= wi <= 104
// 	The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
// 	1 <= queries.length == q <= 105
// 	queries[i].length == 2 or 4
// 	
// 		queries[i] == [1, u, v, w'] or,
// 		queries[i] == [2, x]
// 		1 <= u, v, x <= n
// 		(u, v) is always an edge from edges.
// 		1 <= w' <= 104

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor (tree, array, dfs)
//   • When to use: Use this algorithm to efficiently find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. It is particularly effective for answering multiple LCA queries on a static tree after initial preprocessing.
//   • Idea: This algorithm preprocesses a tree using a DFS to build an Euler tour and record node depths. It transforms Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries into Range Minimum Queries (RMQ) on the Euler tour, enabling O(1) query time after O(N log N) preprocessing.
//   • Invariants: During DFS, `euler` contains the sequence of visited nodes, and `height` stores each node's depth from the root.; The `first` array correctly maps each node to its initial index in the `euler` tour.
//   • Tips: Perform a single DFS to compute node depths and construct the Euler tour along with first occurrences.; Utilize a Sparse Table or Segment Tree for O(1) or O(log N) Range Minimum Query after preprocessing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly building the Euler tour, especially missing the 'return' visits to parent nodes.; Off-by-one errors when defining the range for the Range Minimum Query on the Euler tour.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Tarjan's off-line algorithm (tree, ds, dfs, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Lowest Common Ancestor for multiple pairs of nodes in a tree, and all queries are known beforehand. It's an efficient offline approach for batch processing LCA queries.
//   • Idea: Tarjan's offline LCA algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal combined with a Union-Find data structure to answer all LCA queries efficiently. It processes N nodes and Q queries in O(N + Q * alpha(N)) time, where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.
//   • Invariants: After visiting a node 'u' and all its children, 'u' is marked as visited.; For any node 'v' whose subtree has been fully processed, 'find_set(v)' returns the representative of 'v''s component.
//   • Tips: Mark nodes as visited during DFS to track processed subtrees.; Use Union-Find's union operation to merge child subtrees with their parent after processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited, leading to incorrect LCA identification.; Incorrectly updating the 'ancestor' array or 'find_set' logic in Union-Find.
