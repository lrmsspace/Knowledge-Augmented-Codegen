// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-with-xor-in-a-range/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given a (0-indexed) integer array nums and two integers low and high, return the number of nice pairs.
//
// A nice pair is a pair (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < nums.length and low <= (nums[i] XOR nums[j]) <= high.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,4,2,7], low = 2, high = 6
// Output: 6
// Explanation: All nice pairs (i, j) are as follows:
//     - (0, 1): nums[0] XOR nums[1] = 5 
//     - (0, 2): nums[0] XOR nums[2] = 3
//     - (0, 3): nums[0] XOR nums[3] = 6
//     - (1, 2): nums[1] XOR nums[2] = 6
//     - (1, 3): nums[1] XOR nums[3] = 3
//     - (2, 3): nums[2] XOR nums[3] = 5
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 104
// 	1 <= low <= high <= 2 * 104

// - Sqrt Tree (array, tree, recursion)
//   • When to use: When you need to perform O(1) range queries and support efficient updates (single element or range) on an array, leveraging a hierarchical decomposition.
//   • Idea: A Sqrt Tree is a data structure that supports O(1) range queries and efficient updates on an array. It recursively decomposes the array into blocks and layers, using precomputed information and bitwise operations to quickly answer queries and propagate updates.
//   • Invariants: Each element is part of exactly one block at each layer of the Sqrt Tree.; The highest differing bit between `l` and `r` identifies the specific layer for processing `q(l, r)`.
//   • Tips: Precompute highest bit for efficient layer selection.; Decompose queries into intra-block and inter-block segments.
//   • Pitfalls: Naive updates can result in O(N) complexity per update.; High memory consumption due to multiple layers of precomputed arrays.
// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Fenwick Tree (array, bit-fenwick, prefix-sum)
//   • When to use: Use when frequent point updates and range sum queries are needed on an array. It offers logarithmic time complexity for both operations, making it more efficient than a simple prefix sum array for dynamic data.
//   • Idea: A Fenwick Tree, or Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that efficiently calculates prefix sums and updates individual elements in an array. Both operations typically run in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: Each node `tree[i]` stores the sum of a specific range of elements ending at index `i`.; The length of the range summed by `tree[i]` is determined by `i & (-i)` (lowbit operation).
//   • Tips: Understand the lowbit operation and its role in navigating the tree structure.; Use 1-based indexing for simpler implementation of lowbit calculations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting 1-based indexing can lead to off-by-one errors and incorrect results.; Incorrectly implementing the lowbit calculation or update/query logic.

// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
