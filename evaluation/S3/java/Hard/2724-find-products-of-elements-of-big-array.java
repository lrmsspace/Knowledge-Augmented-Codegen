// The array big_nums is created by concatenating the powerful arrays for every positive integer i in ascending order: 1, 2, 3, and so on. Thus, big_nums begins as [1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 8, ...].
//
// You are given a 2D integer matrix queries, where for queries[i] = [fromi, toi, modi] you should calculate (big_nums[fromi] * big_nums[fromi + 1] * ... * big_nums[toi]) % modi.
//
// Return an integer array answer such that answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
//
// Example:
// Input: queries = [[1,3,7]]
//
// Output: [4]
//
// Explanation:
//
// There is one query.
//
// big_nums[1..3] = [2,1,2]. The product of them is 4. The result is 4 % 7 = 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= queries.length <= 500
// 	queries[i].length == 3
// 	0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] <= 1015
// 	1 <= queries[i][2] <= 105

// - Binary Exponentiation by Factoring (number, counting, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: Use when performing modular exponentiation for an odd base modulo a power of two, especially when dealing with specific logarithmic-like functions or inverses in this modulus.
//   • Idea: This technique computes modular exponentiation for an odd base modulo a power of two by factoring the exponent or its inverse into a product of terms like (2^n+1). It leverages bit manipulation to efficiently find this factorization, allowing for O(d) or O(d log d) complexity where d is the exponent of the modulus.
//   • Invariants: During the iterative process to find $x^{-1} \pmod{2^d}$, the current value of $x$ is always odd.; After processing bit $n$, the $n$-th bit of the current $x$ (for $x^{-1}$ calculation) is zero, and lower bits are unchanged.
//   • Tips: Precompute $4L(2^n+1)$ values for efficiency.; Leverage bitwise operations for multiplying by $2^n+1$ (e.g., x = x + (x << n)).
//   • Pitfalls: This method is specific to odd bases and moduli of the form $2^d$; it's not a general modular exponentiation.; Careful handling of negative results from $4L(x^{-1})$ when working with modular arithmetic.
// - Bit manipulation (number, counting, recursion)
//   • When to use: Use for efficient low-level operations on integers, checking properties related to powers of two, or manipulating individual bits. It provides constant-time solutions for many numerical checks.
//   • Idea: This card covers fundamental bitwise operations for checking number properties like divisibility by powers of two, identifying powers of two, and manipulating individual bits. These operations typically run in O(1) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For a positive integer `n`, `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` if and only if `n` is a power of two.; An integer `n` is divisible by `2^k` if and only if its `k` least significant bits are all zero, which is checked by `(n & ((1 << k) - 1)) == 0`.
//   • Tips: Use `n & 1` to efficiently check if a number `n` is odd or even.; The expression `1 << k` calculates 2 raised to the power of `k`.
//   • Pitfalls: When checking if a number is a power of two, remember to handle the `n == 0` case separately as `0 & (-1)` is `0`.; Be cautious with integer overflow when performing left shifts (`1 << k`) for large `k` values.
// - Binary Exponentiation by Factoring (number, mod-exp)
//   • When to use: When computing a number raised to a very large power modulo another number efficiently. It is also applicable when specific properties of the base or modulus allow for specialized bitwise optimizations.
//   • Idea: Binary exponentiation (also known as exponentiation by squaring) computes a^b mod m by leveraging the binary representation of the exponent b. This method significantly reduces the number of multiplications from O(b) to O(log b), achieving O(log b) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: (original_base^original_exponent) % m == (current_base^current_exponent * accumulated_result) % m; current_exponent is always non-negative and strictly decreases towards zero.
//   • Tips: Use long long for intermediate products to prevent overflow before taking modulo.; Apply the modulo operation after each multiplication to keep numbers small.
//   • Pitfalls: Integer overflow if intermediate products are not reduced modulo m frequently enough.; Incorrectly handling the exponent 0 or negative exponents (if applicable).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
