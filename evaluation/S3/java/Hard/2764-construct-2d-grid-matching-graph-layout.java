// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-2d-grid-matching-graph-layout/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array edges representing an undirected graph having n nodes, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes an edge between nodes ui and vi.
//
// Construct a 2D grid that satisfies these conditions:
//
//
// 	The grid contains all nodes from 0 to n - 1 in its cells, with each node appearing exactly once.
// 	Two nodes should be in adjacent grid cells (horizontally or vertically) if and only if there is an edge between them in edges.
//
//
// It is guaranteed that edges can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.
//
// Return a 2D integer array satisfying the conditions above. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
//
// Output: [[3,1],[2,0]]
//
// Explanation:
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= n <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= edges.length <= 105
// 	edges[i] = [ui, vi]
// 	0 <= ui < vi < n
// 	All the edges are distinct.
// 	The input is generated such that edges can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.

// - Undirected Graphs (graph, array, simulation)
//   • When to use: When modeling symmetric relationships between entities and needing to explore, analyze connectivity, or find paths within the network. Useful for problems involving reachability or structural properties.
//   • Idea: Undirected graphs represent symmetric relationships between pairs of vertices. Simulation on them involves systematically exploring or processing these connections, often with O(V+E) complexity for basic traversals.
//   • Invariants: All vertices reachable from the source within 'k' edges have been processed by the 'k'-th step of BFS.; Each edge in the graph is traversed at most twice (once for each direction) during a full graph traversal.
//   • Tips: Use an adjacency list for sparse graphs to optimize space and traversal time.; Use an adjacency matrix for dense graphs or when O(1) edge existence checks are critical.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to handle disconnected components, leading to incomplete graph processing.; Incorrectly representing undirected edges (e.g., only adding one direction to an adjacency list).
// - Undirected Graphs (graph, matrix, simulation)
//   • When to use: Use when modeling symmetric relationships between entities, analyzing graph properties like connectivity or degrees, or simulating processes on a network where connections are bidirectional.
//   • Idea: An undirected graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges, where each edge connects two vertices symmetrically. Basic operations often have a time complexity of O(V+E) or O(V^2) depending on representation.
//   • Invariants: For every edge (u, v) in the graph, the edge (v, u) also exists.; The sum of degrees of all vertices equals twice the number of edges.
//   • Tips: Choose adjacency list for sparse graphs, adjacency matrix for dense graphs.; Degrees of vertices are easily calculated from adjacency representations.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to add both (u,v) and (v,u) when using an adjacency matrix or list.; Not handling disconnected components during full graph traversals.
// - Finding faces of a planar graph (graph, array, dfs, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Used to identify and enumerate all faces (regions) of a given planar graph, typically when its geometric embedding is known or can be derived.
//   • Idea: This algorithm finds all faces of a planar graph by traversing edges in a specific angular order around each vertex. It achieves a time complexity of O(N log N) due to sorting, or O(N) if edges are pre-sorted.
//   • Invariants: Every directed edge is part of exactly one face boundary traversal.; At any vertex u, the next edge (u, w) is chosen such that it is immediately counter-clockwise to the incoming edge (v, u) in u's adjacency list.
//   • Tips: Sort adjacent edges by polar angle for each vertex.; Mark directed edges as visited to ensure each face is found once.
//   • Pitfalls: Errors in polar angle sorting, especially for collinear edges.; Failing to correctly mark directed edges as visited, leading to infinite loops or duplicate faces.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
