// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-subsequence-sum/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums and an integer goal.
//
// You want to choose a subsequence of nums such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to goal. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is sum, then you want to minimize the absolute difference abs(sum - goal).
//
// Return the minimum possible value of abs(sum - goal).
//
// Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements (possibly all or none) of the original array.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
// Output: 0
// Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
// This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 40
// 	-107 <= nums[i] <= 107
// 	-109 <= goal <= 109

// - Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones (number, recursion, backtracking)
//   • When to use: Use when counting numbers within a range that satisfy a specific digit-based or bit-based pattern constraint, especially when the constraint involves adjacent digits or bits.
//   • Idea: This algorithm recursively generates binary numbers bit by bit, ensuring no two consecutive ones are formed. It prunes branches that exceed a given upper limit or violate the consecutive one constraint, effectively counting valid numbers up to N in O(log N) time.
//   • Invariants: The `sum` generated so far never exceeds the target `num`.; The `prev` boolean accurately reflects whether the last bit added was a '1'.
//   • Tips: Generate numbers bit by bit, typically from LSB or MSB, to build up valid sequences.; Maintain state about the previously placed bit to enforce the 'no consecutive ones' rule.
//   • Pitfalls: Failing to correctly handle the base cases for the recursive function.; Incorrectly managing the 'previous bit' state, leading to invalid sequences.
// - Generating all K-combinations (bitset, recursion, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use when an exhaustive list of all subsets of a specific size K from a set of N items is required. It's suitable for problems needing to explore every possible configuration of K elements.
//   • Idea: This algorithm systematically generates all unique subsets of size K from a set of N distinct elements, commonly employing recursion or bit manipulation. The typical time complexity is O(N choose K * K) for construction or O(N choose K) if just iterating.
//   • Invariants: The current partial combination always contains unique elements.; The number of elements chosen so far does not exceed K.
//   • Tips: Employ backtracking or recursion for a straightforward implementation.; Utilize bitmasks for efficient representation and generation, especially for smaller N.
//   • Pitfalls: Accidentally generating duplicate combinations if elements are not handled uniquely.; Failing to correctly define base cases or termination conditions for recursive calls.
// - Digit DP (array, number, digit-dp, recursion)
//   • When to use: Used for counting numbers or summing properties of numbers within a given range [A, B] that satisfy certain digit-based conditions.
//   • Idea: Digit DP is a dynamic programming technique to count numbers or calculate sums of properties for numbers in a given range [A, B] by building them digit by digit. It typically operates in O(D * S) time, where D is the number of digits and S is the maximum sum/property value.
//   • Invariants: The `tight` parameter correctly reflects if the current digit choice is restricted by the original number's digit at the current position.; The `sum` parameter accurately accumulates the sum of digits chosen for the prefix constructed so far.
//   • Tips: Convert the upper bound number into a digit array for easier processing.; Define the DP state to include current index, tight constraint, and any relevant accumulated property (e.g., sum, count).
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the `tight` constraint, leading to overcounting or undercounting.; Forgetting to memoize or using an insufficient DP table size for state parameters.
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
