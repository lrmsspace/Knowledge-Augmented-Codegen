//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only. No letter occurs more than once in any string of words.
//
// Two strings s1 and s2 are said to be connected if the set of letters of s2 can be obtained from the set of letters of s1 by any one of the following operations:
//
//
// 	Adding exactly one letter to the set of the letters of s1.
// 	Deleting exactly one letter from the set of the letters of s1.
// 	Replacing exactly one letter from the set of the letters of s1 with any letter, including itself.
//
//
// The array words can be divided into one or more non-intersecting groups. A string belongs to a group if any one of the following is true:
//
//
// 	It is connected to at least one other string of the group.
// 	It is the only string present in the group.
//
//
// Note that the strings in words should be grouped in such a manner that a string belonging to a group cannot be connected to a string present in any other group. It can be proved that such an arrangement is always unique.
//
// Return an array ans of size 2 where:
//
//
// 	ans[0] is the maximum number of groups words can be divided into, and
// 	ans[1] is the size of the largest group.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["a","b","ab","cde"]
// Output: [2,3]
// Explanation:
// - words[0] can be used to obtain words[1] (by replacing 'a' with 'b'), and words[2] (by adding 'b'). So words[0] is connected to words[1] and words[2].
// - words[1] can be used to obtain words[0] (by replacing 'b' with 'a'), and words[2] (by adding 'a'). So words[1] is connected to words[0] and words[2].
// - words[2] can be used to obtain words[0] (by deleting 'b'), and words[1] (by deleting 'a'). So words[2] is connected to words[0] and words[1].
// - words[3] is not connected to any string in words.
// Thus, words can be divided into 2 groups ["a","b","ab"] and ["cde"]. The size of the largest group is 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 2 * 104
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 26
// 	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters only.
// 	No letter occurs more than once in words[i].

// Helpful references (internal KB):
// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, tree, array, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to efficiently manage a collection of disjoint sets, supporting operations to merge sets and determine if two elements belong to the same set.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that maintains a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: union (merging two sets) and find (determining the representative of an element's set). With path compression and union by rank/size, operations achieve nearly O(1) amortized time complexity.
//   • Invariants: For any element `v`, `parent[v]` is either `v` itself (if `v` is a root) or an ancestor of `v`.; All elements belonging to the same set share a common root representative.
//   • Tips: Apply path compression during `find_set` to optimize future queries.; Utilize union by rank or size to maintain balanced trees.
//   • Pitfalls: Omitting path compression or union by rank/size results in poor performance.; Failing to correctly identify the root of a set in `find_set`.
// - Disjoint Set Union (ds, tree, array, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and efficiently perform union operations to merge sets or find the representative of an element's set.
//   • Idea: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets and supports two primary operations: finding the representative of an element's set and merging two sets. With path compression and union by rank/size, these operations achieve nearly constant amortized time complexity, O(alpha(N)).
//   • Invariants: Each element `v` is either a root (parent[v] == v) or has a parent pointer to another element in its set.; The `find_set` operation, after path compression, ensures that all nodes on the path from `v` to its root directly point to the root.
//   • Tips: Implement path compression in `find_set` for optimal performance.; Use union by rank or union by size to keep trees flat and balanced.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting path compression or union by rank/size leads to O(N) worst-case operations.; Incorrectly merging sets by only updating one root without considering the other's rank/size.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
