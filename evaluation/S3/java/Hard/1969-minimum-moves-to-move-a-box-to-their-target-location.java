// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-move-a-box-to-their-target-location/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// A storekeeper is a game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.
//
// The game is represented by an m x n grid of characters grid where each element is a wall, floor, or box.
//
// Your task is to move the box 'B' to the target position 'T' under the following rules:
//
//
// 	The character 'S' represents the player. The player can move up, down, left, right in grid if it is a floor (empty cell).
// 	The character '.' represents the floor which means a free cell to walk.
// 	The character '#' represents the wall which means an obstacle (impossible to walk there).
// 	There is only one box 'B' and one target cell 'T' in the grid.
// 	The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a push.
// 	The player cannot walk through the box.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of pushes to move the box to the target. If there is no way to reach the target, return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
//                ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],
//                ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],
//                ["#",".","#","#",".","#"],
//                ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
//                ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We return only the number of times the box is pushed.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 20
// 	grid contains only characters '.', '#', 'S', 'T', or 'B'.
// 	There is only one character 'S', 'B', and 'T' in the grid.

// - Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile. Problem "Parquet" (matrix, bitset, dp-2d, bitmask-dp)
//   • When to use: When problems involve tiling a grid or area with specific shapes, and the state can be represented by the 'profile' or boundary between processed and unprocessed cells, often using a bitmask.
//   • Idea: Dynamic Programming on Broken Profile is a technique used to solve tiling problems on grids by iterating through cells and maintaining the 'profile' of the boundary between filled and unfilled regions using a bitmask. This approach typically has a time complexity of O(N * M * 2^M) or O(N * M * 2^N), depending on the smaller dimension.
//   • Invariants: dp[row][mask] correctly stores the count of ways to tile the grid up to row-1, with mask representing the profile of row `row`.; All cells in rows 0 through `row-1` are completely and non-overlappingly tiled.
//   • Tips: Represent the profile as a bitmask where each bit indicates the state of a cell on the boundary.; Process the grid cell by cell, usually row by row, then column by column within a row.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly defining the bitmask or its interpretation (e.g., which direction it represents).; Handling boundary conditions and edge cases for the grid dimensions.
// - Multi source BFS (queue, graph, multi-source-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the shortest distance from any of a given set of source nodes to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph or grid.
//   • Idea: Multi-source BFS explores a graph or grid by starting from multiple initial nodes simultaneously, finding the shortest path from any of these sources to all other reachable nodes. It operates in O(V + E) time for graphs or O(rows * cols) for grids.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the queue are at the same shortest distance level from any source.; When a node `u` is dequeued, `dist[u]` represents the finalized shortest distance from any source to `u`.
//   • Tips: Initialize distances for all sources to 0 and add them to the queue.; Use a `visited` array or set to prevent redundant processing of nodes.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark initial sources as visited before adding to the queue.; Incorrectly initializing distances for non-source nodes (should be infinity or a large value).
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, queue, 01-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding shortest paths in a graph where edge weights are restricted to only 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum distances from a source to all reachable nodes, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
//   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds shortest paths from a single source in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It achieves this in O(V + E) time complexity by using a deque to prioritize 0-weight edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes in the deque have a distance value less than or equal to any node not yet processed.; Nodes added to the front of the deque (0-weight edges) always have a distance equal to the node they came from.
//   • Tips: Use a deque to maintain order: 0-weight edges go to front, 1-weight edges to back.; Initialize distances to infinity and source distance to 0.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update distances for 0-weight edges before adding to deque front.; Incorrectly handling visited states, leading to TLE or incorrect paths.
