// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-after-removals-on-a-tree/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.
//
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n where nums[i] represents the value of the ith node. You are also given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
//
// Remove two distinct edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:
//
//
// 	Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for each of the three components respectively.
// 	The difference between the largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value is the score of the pair.
//
//
//
// 	For example, say the three components have the node values: [4,5,7], [1,9], and [3,3,3]. The three XOR values are 4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = 6, 1 ^ 9 = 8, and 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 3. The largest XOR value is 8 and the smallest XOR value is 3. The score is then 8 - 3 = 5.
//
//
// Return the minimum score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [1,5,5,4,11], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
// Output: 9
// Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
// - The 1st component has nodes [1,3,4] with values [5,4,11]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.
// - The 2nd component has node [0] with value [1]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
// - The 3rd component has node [2] with value [5]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
// The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
// It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.
//
// Constraints:
// n == nums.length
// 	3 <= n <= 1000
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 108
// 	edges.length == n - 1
// 	edges[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= ai, bi < n
// 	ai != bi
// 	edges represents a valid tree.

// - Paint the edges of the tree (tree, array, dfs, lca, segment-tree)
//   • When to use: Used for efficiently handling queries on a tree that involve updating edge properties (like color) and querying aggregated properties (like count of colored edges) along paths between two nodes.
//   • Idea: This technique uses an Euler tour and two segment trees to maintain edge properties and query path sums. It allows for O(log N) updates and queries after an O(N) preprocessing step.
//   • Invariants: The Euler tour correctly records each edge traversal exactly twice (once forward, once backward).; Each segment tree accurately maintains the sum of colored edges for its respective traversal direction.
//   • Tips: Reduce general path queries (i, j) to ancestor-descendant queries (LCA(i,j), i) and (LCA(i,j), j) using Lowest Common Ancestor.; The Euler tour transforms tree paths into contiguous segments in an array, enabling segment tree operations.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling the LCA step can lead to wrong path decomposition for general queries.; Off-by-one errors when defining the segment tree query range [p, q-1] in the Euler tour.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Tarjan's off-line algorithm (tree, ds, dfs, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to answer multiple Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries on a static tree, and all queries are available before processing.
//   • Idea: Tarjan's off-line LCA algorithm efficiently computes the Lowest Common Ancestor for multiple pairs of nodes in a tree using a single Depth-First Search traversal combined with a Disjoint Set Union data structure, achieving nearly linear time complexity.
//   • Invariants: When DFS is at node `v`, all its children's subtrees have been fully processed and merged into `v`'s DSU set.; For any node `x` whose DFS has completed, `ancestor[find_set(x)]` stores an ancestor of `x` on the path to the root.
//   • Tips: Initialize each node as its own set in DSU with itself as the ancestor.; Process queries for a node only after its children's subtrees are fully processed.
//   • Pitfalls: Not suitable for online LCA queries or dynamic tree structures.; Incorrectly updating the `ancestor` array in the DSU can lead to wrong LCAs.
// - Lowest Common Ancestor - Tarjan's off-line algorithm (tree, ds, dfs, union-find)
//   • When to use: Use when you need to find the Lowest Common Ancestor for multiple pairs of nodes in a tree, and all queries are known beforehand. It's an efficient offline approach for batch processing LCA queries.
//   • Idea: Tarjan's offline LCA algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal combined with a Union-Find data structure to answer all LCA queries efficiently. It processes N nodes and Q queries in O(N + Q * alpha(N)) time, where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.
//   • Invariants: After visiting a node 'u' and all its children, 'u' is marked as visited.; For any node 'v' whose subtree has been fully processed, 'find_set(v)' returns the representative of 'v''s component.
//   • Tips: Mark nodes as visited during DFS to track processed subtrees.; Use Union-Find's union operation to merge child subtrees with their parent after processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited, leading to incorrect LCA identification.; Incorrectly updating the 'ancestor' array or 'find_set' logic in Union-Find.
