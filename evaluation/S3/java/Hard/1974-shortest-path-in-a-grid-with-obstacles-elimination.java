// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an m x n integer matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in one step.
//
// Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner (0, 0) to the lower right corner (m - 1, n - 1) given that you can eliminate at most k obstacles. If it is not possible to find such walk return -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,0]], k = 1
// Output: 6
// Explanation: 
// The shortest path without eliminating any obstacle is 10.
// The shortest path with one obstacle elimination at position (3,2) is 6. Such path is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2).
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 40
// 	1 <= k <= m * n
// 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
// 	grid[0][0] == grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 0
//

//   • When to use: Use when finding the shortest path in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum costs without a full priority queue.
//   • Idea: A specialized Breadth-First Search variant that finds shortest paths in graphs with only 0 or 1 edge weights. It uses a deque to process 0-weight edges before 1-weight edges, achieving O(V+E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: All nodes currently in the deque have a distance value of either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.; Nodes pushed to the front of the deque always have a distance equal to the current node's distance.
//   • Tips: Utilize a deque to maintain the order of processing nodes.; Add nodes reached via 0-weight edges to the front of the deque.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly using a standard queue instead of a deque.; Failing to initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the source.
// - Breadth-first search (graph, deque, array, 01-bfs)
//   • When to use: When finding the shortest path in a graph where edge weights are restricted to 0 or 1, or when minimizing operations where some operations are 'free' (cost 0) and others have a unit cost (cost 1).
//   • Idea: A graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source to all reachable nodes in a graph where edge weights are either 0 or 1. It uses a deque to prioritize 0-cost edges, achieving an optimal O(V + E) time complexity.
//   • Invariants: Nodes are added to the front of the deque if the edge weight is 0, and to the back if 1.; The distance `dist[u]` for any node `u` in the deque is either `k` or `k+1` for some integer `k`.
//   • Tips: Use a deque: push 0-cost edges to the front, 1-cost edges to the back.; Mark nodes visited to avoid cycles and redundant processing.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrectly handling visited states can lead to infinite loops or incorrect paths.; Forgetting to initialize distances properly before starting the traversal.
// - 0-1 BFS (graph, queue, 01-bfs, bfs)
//   • When to use: Use when finding shortest paths in a graph where edge weights are restricted to only 0 or 1. It efficiently determines minimum distances from a source to all reachable nodes, outperforming Dijkstra's for this specific weight constraint.
//   • Idea: 0-1 BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that finds shortest paths from a single source in a graph where all edge weights are either 0 or 1. It achieves this in O(V + E) time complexity by using a deque to prioritize 0-weight edges.
//   • Invariants: All nodes in the deque have a distance value less than or equal to any node not yet processed.; Nodes added to the front of the deque (0-weight edges) always have a distance equal to the node they came from.
//   • Tips: Use a deque to maintain order: 0-weight edges go to front, 1-weight edges to back.; Initialize distances to infinity and source distance to 0.
//   • Pitfalls: Forgetting to update distances for 0-weight edges before adding to deque front.; Incorrectly handling visited states, leading to TLE or incorrect paths.

// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
