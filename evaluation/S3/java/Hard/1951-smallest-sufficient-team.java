//
// Problem Description:
// In a project, you have a list of required skills req_skills, and a list of people. The ith person people[i] contains a list of skills that the person has.
//
// Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in req_skills, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. We can represent these teams by the index of each person.
//
//
// 	For example, team = [0, 1, 3] represents the people with skills people[0], people[1], and people[3].
//
//
// Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person. You may return the answer in any order.
//
// It is guaranteed an answer exists.
//
// Example:
// Input: req_skills = ["java","nodejs","reactjs"], people = [["java"],["nodejs"],["nodejs","reactjs"]]
// Output: [0,2]
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= req_skills.length <= 16
// 	1 <= req_skills[i].length <= 16
// 	req_skills[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
// 	All the strings of req_skills are unique.
// 	1 <= people.length <= 60
// 	0 <= people[i].length <= 16
// 	1 <= people[i][j].length <= 16
// 	people[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.
// 	All the strings of people[i] are unique.
// 	Every skill in people[i] is a skill in req_skills.
// 	It is guaranteed a sufficient team exists.

// - Bit manipulation (number, enumeration, simulation)
//   • When to use: When problems involve manipulating individual bits of numbers, representing sets as bitmasks, or optimizing operations on powers of two. It is also useful for certain combinatorics and dynamic programming problems.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators. This technique is often used to optimize computations, manage boolean flags efficiently, or represent subsets, typically achieving O(1) complexity for fixed-size integers.
//   • Invariants: Each bit in the mask accurately reflects the inclusion or exclusion status of its corresponding element.; Bitwise operations maintain the integrity of unaffected bits.
//   • Tips: Use (1 << k) to create a mask with the k-th bit set.; n & (n-1) clears the least significant set bit.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect operator precedence can lead to subtle bugs.; Mixing signed and unsigned integers in bitwise operations can yield unexpected results.
// - String Hashing (string, array, hashing, enumeration)
//   • When to use: Use string hashing to efficiently compare substrings or patterns within a larger text, or to quickly check for duplicate strings. It's ideal for problems requiring fast equality checks on string segments.
//   • Idea: String hashing converts a string or substring into a numerical hash value, allowing for O(1) comparison of substrings after O(N) precomputation. It typically uses polynomial hashing with a prime base and modulus to minimize collisions.
//   • Invariants: The hash value for the prefix S[0...i] is correctly computed and stored, based on the chosen polynomial hashing scheme.; The base 'p' and modulus 'm' remain constant throughout the hash computation for consistent results.
//   • Tips: Choose a large prime number for the base 'p' (e.g., 31, 53) to reduce collisions.; Select a large prime number for the modulus 'm' (e.g., 10^9+7, 10^9+9) to further minimize collision probability.
//   • Pitfalls: Avoid using 2^64 as a modulus, as specific collision-generating strings exist for this choice.; A small modulus 'm' or base 'p' drastically increases the likelihood of hash collisions.
// - Bit manipulation (number, counting)
//   • When to use: When you need to manipulate individual bits within an integer, optimize space, or perform fast operations on boolean flags or small sets. It's ideal for low-level control and specific integer property checks.
//   • Idea: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operators like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shifts. These operations allow for efficient setting, clearing, flipping, and checking of individual bits, typically with O(1) complexity per operation.
//   • Invariants: The state of any bit `i` where `i != x` is preserved during an operation on the `x`-th bit.; After `n = n | (1 << x)`, the `x`-th bit of `n` is 1.
//   • Tips: Use `1 << x` to create a mask for the x-th bit.; Understand the difference between `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>` operators.
//   • Pitfalls: Incorrect operator precedence (e.g., `&` vs `&&`).; Off-by-one errors with bit indices (0-indexed vs 1-indexed).
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.
