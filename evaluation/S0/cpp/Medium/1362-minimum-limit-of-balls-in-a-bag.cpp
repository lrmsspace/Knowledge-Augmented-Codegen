// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-limit-of-balls-in-a-bag/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an integer maxOperations.
//
// You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:
//
//
// 	Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.
//
// 	
// 		For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.
// 	
// 	
//
//
// Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.
//
// Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 
// - Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
// - Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
// The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 109
//

public:
    int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int maxOperations) {
        int left = 1, right = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int result = right;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long long operationsNeeded = 0;

            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num > mid) {
                    operationsNeeded += (num - 1) / mid; // Calculate operations needed for this bag
                }
            }

            if (operationsNeeded <= maxOperations) {
                result = mid; // Found a valid penalty, try for a smaller one
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1; // Need a larger penalty
            }
        }

        return result;          
    }
