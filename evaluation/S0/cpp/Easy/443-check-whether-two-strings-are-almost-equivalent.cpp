// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/check-whether-two-strings-are-almost-equivalent/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// Two strings word1 and word2 are considered almost equivalent if the differences between the frequencies of each letter from 'a' to 'z' between word1 and word2 is at most 3.
//
// Given two strings word1 and word2, each of length n, return true if word1 and word2 are almost equivalent, or false otherwise.
//
// The frequency of a letter x is the number of times it occurs in the string.
//
// Example:
// Input: word1 = "aaaa", word2 = "bccb"
// Output: false
// Explanation: There are 4 'a's in "aaaa" but 0 'a's in "bccb".
// The difference is 4, which is more than the allowed 3.
//
// Constraints:
// n == word1.length == word2.length
// 	1 <= n <= 100
// 	word1 and word2 consist only of lowercase English letters.
//

            freq[c - 'a']--;
        }

            if (abs(count) > 3) {
                return false;
            }
        }
