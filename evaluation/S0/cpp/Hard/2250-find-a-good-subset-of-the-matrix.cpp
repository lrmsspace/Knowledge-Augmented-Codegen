// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-good-subset-of-the-matrix/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix grid.
//
// Let us call a non-empty subset of rows good if the sum of each column of the subset is at most half of the length of the subset.
//
// More formally, if the length of the chosen subset of rows is k, then the sum of each column should be at most floor(k / 2).
//
// Return an integer array that contains row indices of a good subset sorted in ascending order.
//
// If there are multiple good subsets, you can return any of them. If there are no good subsets, return an empty array.
//
// A subset of rows of the matrix grid is any matrix that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) rows from grid.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]
// Output: [0,1]
// Explanation: We can choose the 0th and 1st rows to create a good subset of rows.
// The length of the chosen subset is 2.
// - The sum of the 0th column is 0 + 0 = 0, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
// - The sum of the 1st column is 1 + 0 = 1, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
// - The sum of the 2nd column is 1 + 0 = 1, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
// - The sum of the 3rd column is 0 + 1 = 1, which is at most half of the length of the subset.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m <= 104
// 	1 <= n <= 5
// 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
//

            int bitmask = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                bitmask = (bitmask << 1) | grid[i][j];

                if ((bitmask & existingMask) == 0) {
                    return {rowIndex, i};
                }
            }

            rowMap[bitmask] = i;
