// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-beautiful-integers-in-the-range/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given positive integers low, high, and k.
//
// A number is beautiful if it meets both of the following conditions:
//
//
// 	The count of even digits in the number is equal to the count of odd digits.
// 	The number is divisible by k.
//
//
// Return the number of beautiful integers in the range [low, high].
//
// Example:
// Input: low = 10, high = 20, k = 3
// Output: 2
// Explanation: There are 2 beautiful integers in the given range: [12,18]. 
// - 12 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 3.
// - 18 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 3.
// Additionally we can see that:
// - 16 is not beautiful because it is not divisible by k = 3.
// - 15 is not beautiful because it does not contain equal counts even and odd digits.
// It can be shown that there are only 2 beautiful integers in the given range.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 < low <= high <= 109
// 	0 < k <= 20
//

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfBeautifulIntegers(int low, int high, int k) {
        return countBeautiful(high, k) - countBeautiful(low - 1, k);            
    }
};
