//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of strings ideas that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:
//
//
// 	Choose 2 distinct names from ideas, call them ideaA and ideaB.
// 	Swap the first letters of ideaA and ideaB with each other.
// 	If both of the new names are not found in the original ideas, then the name ideaA ideaB (the concatenation of ideaA and ideaB, separated by a space) is a valid company name.
// 	Otherwise, it is not a valid name.
//
//
// Return the number of distinct valid names for the company.
//
// Example:
// Input: ideas = ["coffee","donuts","time","toffee"]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: The following selections are valid:
// - ("coffee", "donuts"): The company name created is "doffee conuts".
// - ("donuts", "coffee"): The company name created is "conuts doffee".
// - ("donuts", "time"): The company name created is "tonuts dime".
// - ("donuts", "toffee"): The company name created is "tonuts doffee".
// - ("time", "donuts"): The company name created is "dime tonuts".
// - ("toffee", "donuts"): The company name created is "doffee tonuts".
// Therefore, there are a total of 6 distinct company names.
//
// The following are some examples of invalid selections:
// - ("coffee", "time"): The name "toffee" formed after swapping already exists in the original array.
// - ("time", "toffee"): Both names are still the same after swapping and exist in the original array.
// - ("coffee", "toffee"): Both names formed after swapping already exist in the original array.
//
// Constraints:
// 2 <= ideas.length <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= ideas[i].length <= 10
// 	ideas[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
// 	All the strings in ideas are unique.
//

class Solution {
public:
    long long distinctNames(vector<string>& ideas) {
        unordered_set<string> ideaSet(ideas.begin(), ideas.end());
        long long result = 0;
        int n = ideas.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                string a = ideas[i];
                string b = ideas[j];
                
                swap(a[0], b[0]);
                
                if (ideaSet.find(a) == ideaSet.end() && ideaSet.find(b) == ideaSet.end()) {
                    result += 2;  // (ideaA, ideaB) and (ideaB, ideaA)
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;          
    }
};
