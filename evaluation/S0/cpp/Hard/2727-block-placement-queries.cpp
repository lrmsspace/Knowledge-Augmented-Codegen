// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/block-placement-queries/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There exists an infinite number line, with its origin at 0 and extending towards the positive x-axis.
//
// You are given a 2D array queries, which contains two types of queries:
//
//
// 	For a query of type 1, queries[i] = [1, x]. Build an obstacle at distance x from the origin. It is guaranteed that there is no obstacle at distance x when the query is asked.
// 	For a query of type 2, queries[i] = [2, x, sz]. Check if it is possible to place a block of size sz anywhere in the range [0, x] on the line, such that the block entirely lies in the range [0, x]. A block cannot be placed if it intersects with any obstacle, but it may touch it. Note that you do not actually place the block. Queries are separate.
//
//
// Return a boolean array results, where results[i] is true if you can place the block specified in the ith query of type 2, and false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: queries = [[1,2],[2,3,3],[2,3,1],[2,2,2]]
//
// Output: [false,true,true]
//
// Explanation:
//
//
//
// For query 0, place an obstacle at x = 2. A block of size at most 2 can be placed before x = 3.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= queries.length <= 15 * 104
// 	2 <= queries[i].length <= 3
// 	1 <= queries[i][0] <= 2
// 	1 <= x, sz <= min(5 * 104, 3 * queries.length)
// 	The input is generated such that for queries of type 1, no obstacle exists at distance x when the query is asked.
// 	The input is generated such that there is at least one query of type 2.
//

                // Place obstacle
                obstacles.insert(query[1]);
            } else {
                // Check placement
                int x = query[1];
                int sz = query[2];
                
                auto it = obstacles.lower_bound(x + 1);
                int rightObstacle = (it == obstacles.begin()) ? INT_MAX : *(--it);
                int leftObstacle = (it == obstacles.begin()) ? INT_MIN : *(--it);
                
                int maxBlockSize = rightObstacle - leftObstacle - 1;
                
                results.push_back(maxBlockSize >= sz);
            }
        }
        
        return results;
