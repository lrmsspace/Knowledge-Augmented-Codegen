// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-building-where-alice-and-bob-can-meet/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array heights of positive integers, where heights[i] represents the height of the ith building.
//
// If a person is in building i, they can move to any other building j if and only if i < j and heights[i] < heights[j].
//
// You are also given another array queries where queries[i] = [ai, bi]. On the ith query, Alice is in building ai while Bob is in building bi.
//
// Return an array ans where ans[i] is the index of the leftmost building where Alice and Bob can meet on the ith query. If Alice and Bob cannot move to a common building on query i, set ans[i] to -1.
//
// Example:
// Input: heights = [6,4,8,5,2,7], queries = [[0,1],[0,3],[2,4],[3,4],[2,2]]
// Output: [2,5,-1,5,2]
// Explanation: In the first query, Alice and Bob can move to building 2 since heights[0] < heights[2] and heights[1] < heights[2]. 
// In the second query, Alice and Bob can move to building 5 since heights[0] < heights[5] and heights[3] < heights[5]. 
// In the third query, Alice cannot meet Bob since Alice cannot move to any other building.
// In the fourth query, Alice and Bob can move to building 5 since heights[3] < heights[5] and heights[4] < heights[5].
// In the fifth query, Alice and Bob are already in the same building.  
// For ans[i] != -1, It can be shown that ans[i] is the leftmost building where Alice and Bob can meet.
// For ans[i] == -1, It can be shown that there is no building where Alice and Bob can meet.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= heights.length <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= heights[i] <= 109
// 	1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 104
// 	queries[i] = [ai, bi]
// 	0 <= ai, bi <= heights.length - 1
//

                    break;
