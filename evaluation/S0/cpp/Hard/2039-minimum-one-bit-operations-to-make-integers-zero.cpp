// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:
//
//
// 	Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
// 	Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.
//
//
// Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
// "11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
// "01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.
//
// Constraints:
// 0 <= n <= 109
//
