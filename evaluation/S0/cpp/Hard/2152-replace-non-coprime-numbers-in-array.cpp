// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-non-coprime-numbers-in-array/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of integers nums. Perform the following steps:
//
//
// 	Find any two adjacent numbers in nums that are non-coprime.
// 	If no such numbers are found, stop the process.
// 	Otherwise, delete the two numbers and replace them with their LCM (Least Common Multiple).
// 	Repeat this process as long as you keep finding two adjacent non-coprime numbers.
//
//
// Return the final modified array. It can be shown that replacing adjacent non-coprime numbers in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.
//
// The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are less than or equal to 108.
//
// Two values x and y are non-coprime if GCD(x, y) > 1 where GCD(x, y) is the Greatest Common Divisor of x and y.
//
// Example:
// Input: nums = [6,4,3,2,7,6,2]
// Output: [12,7,6]
// Explanation: 
// - (6, 4) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 4) = 12. Now, nums = [12,3,2,7,6,2].
// - (12, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 3) = 12. Now, nums = [12,2,7,6,2].
// - (12, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 2) = 12. Now, nums = [12,7,6,2].
// - (6, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 2) = 6. Now, nums = [12,7,6].
// There are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.
// Thus, the final modified array is [12,7,6].
// Note that there are other ways to obtain the same resultant array.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 105
// 	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
// 	The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are less than or equal to 108.
