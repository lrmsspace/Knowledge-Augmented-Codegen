//
// Problem Description:
// There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits "How many rabbits have the same color as you?" and collected the answers in an integer array answers where answers[i] is the answer of the ith rabbit.
//
// Given the array answers, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.
//
// Example:
// Input: answers = [1,1,2]
// Output: 5
// Explanation:
// The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.
// The rabbit that answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
// Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.
// Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
// The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= answers.length <= 1000
// 	0 <= answers[i] < 1000
//

int numRabbits(int* answers, int answersSize) {
    int count[1000] = {0};
    int result = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < answersSize; i++) {
        count[answers[i]]++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        if (count[i] > 0) {
            int groupSize = i + 1;
            int groups = (count[i] + groupSize - 1) / groupSize; // Ceiling division
            result += groups * groupSize;
        }
    }

    return result;      
}
