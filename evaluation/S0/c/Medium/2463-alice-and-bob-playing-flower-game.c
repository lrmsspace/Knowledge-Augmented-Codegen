//
// Problem Description:
// Alice and Bob are playing a turn-based game on a field, with two lanes of flowers between them. There are x flowers in the first lane between Alice and Bob, and y flowers in the second lane between them.
//
//
//
// The game proceeds as follows:
//
//
// 	Alice takes the first turn.
// 	In each turn, a player must choose either one of the lane and pick one flower from that side.
// 	At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all in either lane, the current player captures their opponent and wins the game.
//
//
// Given two integers, n and m, the task is to compute the number of possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions:
//
//
// 	Alice must win the game according to the described rules.
// 	The number of flowers x in the first lane must be in the range [1,n].
// 	The number of flowers y in the second lane must be in the range [1,m].
//
//
// Return the number of possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the statement.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, m = 2
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The following pairs satisfy conditions described in the statement: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1).
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n, m <= 105
//

long long flowerGame(int n, int m) {
    long long total_pairs = (long long)n * m;
    long long losing_pairs = (long long)(n / 2) * (m / 2) + (long long)((n + 1) / 2) * ((m + 1) / 2);
    return total_pairs - losing_pairs;      
}
