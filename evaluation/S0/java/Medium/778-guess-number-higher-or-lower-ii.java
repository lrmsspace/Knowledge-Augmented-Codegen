// Problem Description:
// We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:
//
//
// 	I pick a number between 1 and n.
// 	You guess a number.
// 	If you guess the right number, you win the game.
// 	If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.
// 	Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.
//
//
// Given a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 10
// Output: 16
// Explanation: The winning strategy is as follows:
// - The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.
//     - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.
//     - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.
//         - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.
//         - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
//         - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
//     - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.
//         - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.
//         - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.
//             - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.
//             - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
//             - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
//         - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.
//             - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
//             - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.
// The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 200
//
