// Problem Description:
// You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number n. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same label.
//
// Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.
//
// Example:
// Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
//
// Output: 8
//
// Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
//
// After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= tasks.length <= 104
// 	tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
// 	0 <= n <= 100
//

class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] taskCounts = new int[26];
        for (char task : tasks) {
            taskCounts[task - 'A']++;
        }

        Arrays.sort(taskCounts);
        int maxCount = taskCounts[25];
        int idleSlots = (maxCount - 1) * n;

        for (int i = 24; i >= 0 && idleSlots > 0; i--) {
            idleSlots -= Math.min(taskCounts[i], maxCount - 1);
        }

        idleSlots = Math.max(0, idleSlots);
        return tasks.length + idleSlots;            
    }
}
