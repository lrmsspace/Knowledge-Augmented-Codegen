// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/total-cost-to-hire-k-workers/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed integer array costs where costs[i] is the cost of hiring the ith worker.
//
// You are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules:
//
//
// 	You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
// 	In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
// 	
// 		For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].
// 		In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.
// 	
// 	
// 	If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
// 	A worker can only be chosen once.
//
//
// Return the total cost to hire exactly k workers.
//
// Example:
// Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
// Output: 11
// Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
// - In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.
// - In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
// - In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
// The total hiring cost is 11.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= costs.length <= 105 
// 	1 <= costs[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= k, candidates <= costs.length
//

class Solution {
    public long totalCost(int[] costs, int k, int candidates) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> leftHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        PriorityQueue<Integer> rightHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int n = costs.length;
        int leftPtr = 0;
        int rightPtr = n - 1;

        // Initialize the heaps with candidates from both ends
        for (int i = 0; i < candidates; i++) {
            if (leftPtr <= rightPtr) {
                leftHeap.offer(costs[leftPtr++]);
            }
            if (leftPtr <= rightPtr) {
                rightHeap.offer(costs[rightPtr--]);
            }
        }

        long totalCost = 0;

        for (int hireCount = 0; hireCount < k; hireCount++) {
            if (rightHeap.isEmpty() || (!leftHeap.isEmpty() && leftHeap.peek() <= rightHeap.peek())) {
                totalCost += leftHeap.poll();
                if (leftPtr <= rightPtr) {
                    leftHeap.offer(costs[leftPtr++]);
                }
            } else {
                totalCost += rightHeap.poll();
                if (leftPtr <= rightPtr) {
                    rightHeap.offer(costs[rightPtr--]);
                }
            }
        }

        return totalCost;
