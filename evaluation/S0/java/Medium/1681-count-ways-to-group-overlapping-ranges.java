// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-group-overlapping-ranges/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 2D integer array ranges where ranges[i] = [starti, endi] denotes that all integers between starti and endi (both inclusive) are contained in the ith range.
//
// You are to split ranges into two (possibly empty) groups such that:
//
//
// 	Each range belongs to exactly one group.
// 	Any two overlapping ranges must belong to the same group.
//
//
// Two ranges are said to be overlapping if there exists at least one integer that is present in both ranges.
//
//
// 	For example, [1, 3] and [2, 5] are overlapping because 2 and 3 occur in both ranges.
//
//
// Return the total number of ways to split ranges into two groups. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example:
// Input: ranges = [[6,10],[5,15]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 
// The two ranges are overlapping, so they must be in the same group.
// Thus, there are two possible ways:
// - Put both the ranges together in group 1.
// - Put both the ranges together in group 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= ranges.length <= 105
// 	ranges[i].length == 2
// 	0 <= starti <= endi <= 109
//

class Solution {
    public int countWays(int[][] ranges) {
        Arrays.sort(ranges, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        long mod = 1_000_000_007;
        int count = 0;
        long end = -1;

        for (int[] range : ranges) {
            if (range[0] > end) {
                count++;
                end = range[1];
            } else {
                end = Math.max(end, range[1]);
            }
        }

        return (int) modPow(2, count, mod);         
    }
}
