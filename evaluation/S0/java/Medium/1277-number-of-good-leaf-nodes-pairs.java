// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-leaf-nodes-pairs/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the root of a binary tree and an integer distance. A pair of two different leaf nodes of a binary tree is said to be good if the length of the shortest path between them is less than or equal to distance.
//
// Return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], distance = 3
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The leaf nodes of the tree are 3 and 4 and the length of the shortest path between them is 3. This is the only good pair.
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 210].
// 	1 <= Node.val <= 100
// 	1 <= distance <= 10
//
