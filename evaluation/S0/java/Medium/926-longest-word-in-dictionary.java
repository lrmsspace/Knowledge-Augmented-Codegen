// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words.
//
// If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.
//
// Note that the word should be built from left to right with each additional character being added to the end of a previous word.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
// Output: "world"
// Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= words.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 30
// 	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
//

class Solution {
    public String longestWord(String[] words) {
        Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(words));
        String longestWord = "";

        for (String word : words) {
            if (isBuildable(word, wordSet)) {
                if (word.length() > longestWord.length() || 
                    (word.length() == longestWord.length() && word.compareTo(longestWord) < 0)) {
                    longestWord = word;
                }
            }
        }
