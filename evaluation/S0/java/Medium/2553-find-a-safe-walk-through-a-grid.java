// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-safe-walk-through-a-grid/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an m x n binary matrix grid and an integer health.
//
// You start on the upper-left corner (0, 0) and would like to get to the lower-right corner (m - 1, n - 1).
//
// You can move up, down, left, or right from one cell to another adjacent cell as long as your health remains positive.
//
// Cells (i, j) with grid[i][j] = 1 are considered unsafe and reduce your health by 1.
//
// Return true if you can reach the final cell with a health value of 1 or more, and false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1,0]], health = 1
//
// Output: true
//
// Explanation:
//
// The final cell can be reached safely by walking along the gray cells below.
//
// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// 	n == grid[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 50
// 	2 <= m * n
// 	1 <= health <= m + n
// 	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
//

class Solution {
    public boolean findSafeWalk(List<List<Integer>> grid, int health) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid.get(0).size();
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
        return dfs(grid, 0, 0, health, visited);            
    }
}
