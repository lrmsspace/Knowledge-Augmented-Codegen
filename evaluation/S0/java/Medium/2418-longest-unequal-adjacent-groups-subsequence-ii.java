// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-ii/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string array words, and an array groups, both arrays having length n.
//
// The hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.
//
// You need to select the longest subsequence from an array of indices [0, 1, ..., n - 1], such that for the subsequence denoted as [i0, i1, ..., ik-1] having length k, the following holds:
//
//
// 	For adjacent indices in the subsequence, their corresponding groups are unequal, i.e., groups[ij] != groups[ij+1], for each j where 0 < j + 1 < k.
// 	words[ij] and words[ij+1] are equal in length, and the hamming distance between them is 1, where 0 < j + 1 < k, for all indices in the subsequence.
//
//
// Return a string array containing the words corresponding to the indices (in order) in the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
//
// Note: strings in words may be unequal in length.
//
// Example:
// Input: words = ["bab","dab","cab"], groups = [1,2,2]
//
// Output: ["bab","cab"]
//
// Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [0,2].
//
//
// 	groups[0] != groups[2]
// 	words[0].length == words[2].length, and the hamming distance between them is 1.
//
//
// So, a valid answer is [words[0],words[2]] = ["bab","cab"].
//
// Another subsequence that can be selected is [0,1].
//
//
// 	groups[0] != groups[1]
// 	words[0].length == words[1].length, and the hamming distance between them is 1.
//
//
// So, another valid answer is [words[0],words[1]] = ["bab","dab"].
//
// It can be shown that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the conditions is 2.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n == words.length == groups.length <= 1000
// 	1 <= words[i].length <= 10
// 	1 <= groups[i] <= n
// 	words consists of distinct strings.
// 	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
//
