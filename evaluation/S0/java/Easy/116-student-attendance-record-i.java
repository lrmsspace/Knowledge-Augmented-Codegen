// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-i/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:
//
//
// 	'A': Absent.
// 	'L': Late.
// 	'P': Present.
//
//
// The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:
//
//
// 	The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
// 	The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
//
//
// Return true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise.
//
// Example:
// Input: s = "PPALLP"
// Output: true
// Explanation: The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or more consecutive days.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 1000
// 	s[i] is either 'A', 'L', or 'P'.
//

class Solution {
    public boolean checkRecord(String s) {
        int absences = 0;
        int lateStreak = 0;

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'A') {
                absences++;
                if (absences >= 2) {
                    return false;
                }
                lateStreak = 0; // Reset late streak on absence
            } else if (c == 'L') {
                lateStreak++;
                if (lateStreak >= 3) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                lateStreak = 0; // Reset late streak on presence
            }
        }

        return true;
