// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-peaks/   |   Difficulty: Easy
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given a 0-indexed array mountain. Your task is to find all the peaks in the mountain array.
//
// Return an array that consists of indices of peaks in the given array in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: mountain = [2,4,4]
// Output: []
// Explanation: mountain[0] and mountain[2] can not be a peak because they are first and last elements of the array.
// mountain[1] also can not be a peak because it is not strictly greater than mountain[2].
// So the answer is [].
//
// Constraints:
// 3 <= mountain.length <= 100
// 	1 <= mountain[i] <= 100
//
// Notes:
// - Keep the given method signatures unchanged.
// - Use only Java standard library (`java.*`); no external dependencies.
// - Do not change input/output formats or return value semantics.
// - Conformance: single public class 'Solution'; no 'package' statement; place any extra types as static inner classes.
// - If you introduce any helper functions, include their full implementations in this file; no hidden helpers.

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findPeaks(int[] mountain) {
        List<Integer> peaks = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i < mountain.length - 1; i++) {
            if (mountain[i] > mountain[i - 1] && mountain[i] > mountain[i + 1]) {
                peaks.add(i);
            }
        }
        return peaks;           
    }
}
