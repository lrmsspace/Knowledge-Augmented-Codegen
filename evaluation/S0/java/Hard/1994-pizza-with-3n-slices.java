// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/pizza-with-3n-slices/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a pizza with 3n slices of varying size, you and your friends will take slices of pizza as follows:
//
//
// 	You will pick any pizza slice.
// 	Your friend Alice will pick the next slice in the anti-clockwise direction of your pick.
// 	Your friend Bob will pick the next slice in the clockwise direction of your pick.
// 	Repeat until there are no more slices of pizzas.
//
//
// Given an integer array slices that represent the sizes of the pizza slices in a clockwise direction, return the maximum possible sum of slice sizes that you can pick.
//
// Example:
// Input: slices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
// Output: 10
// Explanation: Pick pizza slice of size 4, Alice and Bob will pick slices with size 3 and 5 respectively. Then Pick slices with size 6, finally Alice and Bob will pick slice of size 2 and 1 respectively. Total = 4 + 6.
//
// Constraints:
// 3 * n == slices.length
// 	1 <= slices.length <= 500
// 	1 <= slices[i] <= 1000
//

class Solution {
    public int maxSizeSlices(int[] slices) {
        int n = slices.length;
        return Math.max(helper(slices, 0, n - 2), helper(slices, 1, n - 1));                    
    }
}
