// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-servers-that-handled-most-number-of-requests/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You have k servers numbered from 0 to k-1 that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:
//
//
// 	The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
// 	If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
// 	If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
// 	Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.
//
//
// You are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.
//
// Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.
//
// Example:
// Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
// Output: [1] 
// Explanation: 
// All of the servers start out available.
// The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
// Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
// Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
// Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= k <= 105
// 	1 <= arrival.length, load.length <= 105
// 	arrival.length == load.length
// 	1 <= arrival[i], load[i] <= 109
// 	arrival is strictly increasing.
//

    public List<Integer> busiestServers(int k, int[] arrival, int[] load) {
        TreeSet<Integer> available = new TreeSet<>();
        PriorityQueue<int[]> busy = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
        int n = arrival.length;
        int[] requestsHandled = new int[k];

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            available.add(i);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int arriveTime = arrival[i];
            int loadTime = load[i];

            while (!busy.isEmpty() && busy.peek()[0] <= arriveTime) {
                available.add(busy.poll()[1]);
            }

            if (available.isEmpty()) {
                continue;
            }

            Integer serverIndex = available.ceiling(i % k);
            if (serverIndex == null) {
                serverIndex = available.first();
            }

            requestsHandled[serverIndex]++;
            busy.offer(new int[]{arriveTime + loadTime, serverIndex});
            available.remove(serverIndex);
        }

        int maxRequests = Arrays.stream(requestsHandled).max().orElse(0);
        List<Integer> busiestServers = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (requestsHandled[i] == maxRequests) {
                busiestServers.add(i);
            }
        }

        return busiestServers;                  
    }
