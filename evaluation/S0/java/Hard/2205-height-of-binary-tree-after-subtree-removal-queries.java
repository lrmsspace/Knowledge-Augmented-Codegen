// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/height-of-binary-tree-after-subtree-removal-queries/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from 1 to n. You are also given an array queries of size m.
//
// You have to perform m independent queries on the tree where in the ith query you do the following:
//
//
// 	Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. It is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.
//
//
// Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.
//
// Note:
//
//
// 	The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
// 	The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.
//
// Example:
// Input: root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
// Output: [2]
// Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
// The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).
//
// Constraints:
// The number of nodes in the tree is n.
// 	2 <= n <= 105
// 	1 <= Node.val <= n
// 	All the values in the tree are unique.
// 	m == queries.length
// 	1 <= m <= min(n, 104)
// 	1 <= queries[i] <= n
// 	queries[i] != root.val
//
