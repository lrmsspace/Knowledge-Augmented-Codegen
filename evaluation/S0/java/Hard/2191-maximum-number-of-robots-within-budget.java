// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-robots-within-budget/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You have n robots. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, chargeTimes and runningCosts, both of length n. The ith robot costs chargeTimes[i] units to charge and costs runningCosts[i] units to run. You are also given an integer budget.
//
// The total cost of running k chosen robots is equal to max(chargeTimes) + k * sum(runningCosts), where max(chargeTimes) is the largest charge cost among the k robots and sum(runningCosts) is the sum of running costs among the k robots.
//
// Return the maximum number of consecutive robots you can run such that the total cost does not exceed budget.
//
// Example:
// Input: chargeTimes = [3,6,1,3,4], runningCosts = [2,1,3,4,5], budget = 25
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 
// It is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.
// To obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 * sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 which is less than 25.
// It can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.
//
// Constraints:
// chargeTimes.length == runningCosts.length == n
// 	1 <= n <= 5 * 104
// 	1 <= chargeTimes[i], runningCosts[i] <= 105
// 	1 <= budget <= 1015
//

class Solution {
    public int maximumRobots(int[] chargeTimes, int[] runningCosts, long budget) {
        int n = chargeTimes.length;
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        long runningCostSum = 0;
        int left = 0, maxRobots = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            runningCostSum += runningCosts[right];

            while (!deque.isEmpty() && chargeTimes[deque.peekLast()] <= chargeTimes[right]) {
                deque.pollLast();
            }
            deque.offerLast(right);

            while (deque.peekFirst() + (long)(right - left + 1) * runningCostSum > budget) {
                runningCostSum -= runningCosts[left];
                if (deque.peekFirst() == left) {
                    deque.pollFirst();
                }
                left++;
            }

            maxRobots = Math.max(maxRobots, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxRobots;           
    }
