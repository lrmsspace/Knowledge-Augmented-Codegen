// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/put-marbles-in-bags/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You have k bags. You are given a 0-indexed integer array weights where weights[i] is the weight of the ith marble. You are also given the integer k.
//
// Divide the marbles into the k bags according to the following rules:
//
//
// 	No bag is empty.
// 	If the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith and jth indices should also be in that same bag.
// 	If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of the bag is weights[i] + weights[j].
//
//
// The score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the k bags.
//
// Return the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.
//
// Example:
// Input: weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2
// Output: 4
// Explanation: 
// The distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. 
// The distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. 
// Thus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= k <= weights.length <= 105
// 	1 <= weights[i] <= 109
//

class Solution {
    public long putMarbles(int[] weights, int k) {
        int n = weights.length;
        if (k == 1 || k == n) {
            return 0;
        }

        long[] pairSums = new long[n - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            pairSums[i] = weights[i] + weights[i + 1];
        }

        Arrays.sort(pairSums);

        long minScore = 0;
        long maxScore = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            minScore += pairSums[i];
            maxScore += pairSums[n - 2 - i];
        }

        return maxScore - minScore;         
    }
}
