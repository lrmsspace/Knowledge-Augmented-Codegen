// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// You are asked to cut off all the trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as an m x n matrix. In this matrix:
//
//
// 	0 means the cell cannot be walked through.
// 	1 represents an empty cell that can be walked through.
// 	A number greater than 1 represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height.
//
//
// In one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west. If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.
//
// You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes 1 (an empty cell).
//
// Starting from the point (0, 0), return the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees. If you cannot cut off all the trees, return -1.
//
// Note: The input is generated such that no two trees have the same height, and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.
//
// Example:
// Input: forest = [[1,2,3],[0,0,4],[7,6,5]]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: Following the path above allows you to cut off the trees from shortest to tallest in 6 steps.
//
// Constraints:
// m == forest.length
// 	n == forest[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 50
// 	0 <= forest[i][j] <= 109
// 	Heights of all trees are distinct.
//

    public int cutOffTree(List<List<Integer>> forest) {
        int m = forest.size();

                    trees.add(new int[]{i, j, forest.get(i).get(j)});
                }
            }
        }

        Collections.sort(trees, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[2]));

        int totalSteps = 0;

        for (int[] tree : trees) {
            int steps = bfs(forest, startX, startY, tree[0], tree[1]);
            if (steps == -1) {
                return -1;
            }
            totalSteps += steps;
            startX = tree[0];
            startY = tree[1];
