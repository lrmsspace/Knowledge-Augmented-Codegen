#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can select a subarray and replace it with a single element equal to its maximum value.
#
# Return the maximum possible size of the array after performing zero or more operations such that the resulting array is non-decreasing.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [4,2,5,3,5]
#
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation:
#
# One way to achieve the maximum size is:
#
#
# 	Replace subarray nums[1..2] = [2, 5] with 5 → [4, 5, 3, 5].
# 	Replace subarray nums[2..3] = [3, 5] with 5 → [4, 5, 5].
#
#
# The final array [4, 5, 5] is non-decreasing with size 3.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105
# 	1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 105
#
