#
# Problem Description:
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the longest path, where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.
#
# The length of the path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
#
# Example:
# Input: root = [5,4,5,1,1,null,5]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The shown image shows that the longest path of the same value (i.e. 5).
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
# 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# 	The depth of the tree will not exceed 1000.
#

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
