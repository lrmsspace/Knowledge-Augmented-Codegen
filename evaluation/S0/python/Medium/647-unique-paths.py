# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
#
# Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
#
# The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
#
# Example:
# Input: m = 3, n = 7
# Output: 28
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= m, n <= 100
#
