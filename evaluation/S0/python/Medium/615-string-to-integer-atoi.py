#
# Problem Description:
# Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.
#
# The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:
#
#
# 	Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
# 	Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
# 	Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
# 	Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
#
#
# Return the integer as the final result.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "42"
#
# Output: 42
#
# Explanation:
#
#
# The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
# Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
#          ^
# Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
#          ^
# Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
#            ^
#
# Constraints:
# 0 <= s.length <= 200
# 	s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.
