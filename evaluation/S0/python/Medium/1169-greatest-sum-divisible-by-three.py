#
# Problem Description:
# Given an integer array nums, return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
# Output: 18
# Explanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 104
# 	1 <= nums[i] <= 104
#
