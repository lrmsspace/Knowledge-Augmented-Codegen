# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-non-zero-product-of-the-array-elements/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a positive integer p. Consider an array nums (1-indexed) that consists of the integers in the inclusive range [1, 2p - 1] in their binary representations. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times:
#
#
# 	Choose two elements x and y from nums.
# 	Choose a bit in x and swap it with its corresponding bit in y. Corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the same position in the other integer.
#
#
# For example, if x = 1101 and y = 0011, after swapping the 2nd bit from the right, we have x = 1111 and y = 0001.
#
# Find the minimum non-zero product of nums after performing the above operation any number of times. Return this product modulo 109 + 7.
#
# Note: The answer should be the minimum product before the modulo operation is done.
#
# Example:
# Input: p = 1
# Output: 1
# Explanation: nums = [1].
# There is only one element, so the product equals that element.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= p <= 60
#
