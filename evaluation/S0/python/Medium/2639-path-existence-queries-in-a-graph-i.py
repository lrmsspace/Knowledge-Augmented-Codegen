# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/path-existence-queries-in-a-graph-i/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an integer n representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
#
# You are also given an integer array nums of length n sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer maxDiff.
#
# An undirected edge exists between nodes i and j if the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most maxDiff (i.e., |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff).
#
# You are also given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[i] = [ui, vi], determine whether there exists a path between nodes ui and vi.
#
# Return a boolean array answer, where answer[i] is true if there exists a path between ui and vi in the ith query and false otherwise.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 2, nums = [1,3], maxDiff = 1, queries = [[0,0],[0,1]]
#
# Output: [true,false]
#
# Explanation:
#
#
# 	Query [0,0]: Node 0 has a trivial path to itself.
# 	Query [0,1]: There is no edge between Node 0 and Node 1 because |nums[0] - nums[1]| = |1 - 3| = 2, which is greater than maxDiff.
# 	Thus, the final answer after processing all the queries is [true, false].
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n == nums.length <= 105
# 	0 <= nums[i] <= 105
# 	nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# 	0 <= maxDiff <= 105
# 	1 <= queries.length <= 105
# 	queries[i] == [ui, vi]
# 	0 <= ui, vi < n
#
