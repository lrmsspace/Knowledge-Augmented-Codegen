# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
#
#
# L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
#
#
# Reorder the list to be on the following form:
#
#
# L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
#
#
# You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.
#
# Example:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,4,2,3]
#
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
# 	1 <= Node.val <= 1000
#

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
