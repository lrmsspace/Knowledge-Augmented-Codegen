# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
#
# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.
#
# Example:
# Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
# Output: true
#
# Constraints:
# m == board.length
# 	n = board[i].length
# 	1 <= m, n <= 6
# 	1 <= word.length <= 15
# 	board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
#
#
#  
# Follow up: Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a larger board?
