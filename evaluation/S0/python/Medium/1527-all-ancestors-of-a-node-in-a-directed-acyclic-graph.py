#
# Problem Description:
# You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).
#
# You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from fromi to toi in the graph.
#
# Return a list answer, where answer[i] is the list of ancestors of the ith node, sorted in ascending order.
#
# A node u is an ancestor of another node v if u can reach v via a set of edges.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 8, edgeList = [[0,3],[0,4],[1,3],[2,4],[2,7],[3,5],[3,6],[3,7],[4,6]]
# Output: [[],[],[],[0,1],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,2,3]]
# Explanation:
# The above diagram represents the input graph.
# - Nodes 0, 1, and 2 do not have any ancestors.
# - Node 3 has two ancestors 0 and 1.
# - Node 4 has two ancestors 0 and 2.
# - Node 5 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 3.
# - Node 6 has five ancestors 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
# - Node 7 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 1000
# 	0 <= edges.length <= min(2000, n * (n - 1) / 2)
# 	edges[i].length == 2
# 	0 <= fromi, toi <= n - 1
# 	fromi != toi
# 	There are no duplicate edges.
# 	The graph is directed and acyclic.
