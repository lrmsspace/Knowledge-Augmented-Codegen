# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.
#
# Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 	nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
#

                    zero_count -= 1
