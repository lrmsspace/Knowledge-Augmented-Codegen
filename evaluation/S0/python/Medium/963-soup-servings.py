#
# Problem Description:
# You have two soups, A and B, each starting with n mL. On every turn, one of the following four serving operations is chosen at random, each with probability 0.25 independent of all previous turns:
#
#
# 	pour 100 mL from type A and 0 mL from type B
# 	pour 75 mL from type A and 25 mL from type B
# 	pour 50 mL from type A and 50 mL from type B
# 	pour 25 mL from type A and 75 mL from type B
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# 	There is no operation that pours 0 mL from A and 100 mL from B.
# 	The amounts from A and B are poured simultaneously during the turn.
# 	If an operation asks you to pour more than you have left of a soup, pour all that remains of that soup.
#
#
# The process stops immediately after any turn in which one of the soups is used up.
#
# Return the probability that A is used up before B, plus half the probability that both soups are used up in the same turn. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
#
# Example:
# Input: n = 50
# Output: 0.62500
# Explanation: 
# If we perform either of the first two serving operations, soup A will become empty first.
# If we perform the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
# If we perform the fourth operation, B will become empty first.
# So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.
#
# Constraints:
# 0 <= n <= 109
#
