# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-serialization-of-a-binary-tree/   |   Difficulty: Medium
#
# Problem Description:
# One way to serialize a binary tree is to use preorder traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as '#'.
#
# For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where '#' represents a null node.
#
# Given a string of comma-separated values preorder, return true if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.
#
# It is guaranteed that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.
#
# You may assume that the input format is always valid.
#
#
# 	For example, it could never contain two consecutive commas, such as "1,,3".
#
#
# Note: You are not allowed to reconstruct the tree.
#
# Example:
# Input: preorder = "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
# Output: true
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= preorder.length <= 104
# 	preorder consist of integers in the range [0, 100] and '#' separated by commas ','.
