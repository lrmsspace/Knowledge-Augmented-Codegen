#
# Problem Description:
# Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.
#
# You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
# Output: [1,2,3,5]
# Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
# 	-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104
#
