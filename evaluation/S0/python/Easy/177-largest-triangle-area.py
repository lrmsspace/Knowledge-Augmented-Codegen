# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-triangle-area/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# Given an array of points on the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi], return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three different points. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
#
# Example:
# Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
# Output: 2.00000
# Explanation: The five points are shown in the above figure. The red triangle is the largest.
#
# Constraints:
# 3 <= points.length <= 50
# 	-50 <= xi, yi <= 50
# 	All the given points are unique.
#
