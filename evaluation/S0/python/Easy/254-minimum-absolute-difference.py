#
# Problem Description:
# Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.
#
# Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows
#
#
# 	a, b are from arr
# 	a < b
# 	b - a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr
#
# Example:
# Input: arr = [4,2,1,3]
# Output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
# Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.
#
# Constraints:
# 2 <= arr.length <= 105
# 	-106 <= arr[i] <= 106
#
