# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-convert-time/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given two strings current and correct representing two 24-hour times.
#
# 24-hour times are formatted as "HH:MM", where HH is between 00 and 23, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 24-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 23:59.
#
# In one operation you can increase the time current by 1, 5, 15, or 60 minutes. You can perform this operation any number of times.
#
# Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert current to correct.
#
# Example:
# Input: current = "02:30", correct = "04:35"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# We can convert current to correct in 3 operations as follows:
# - Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "03:30".
# - Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "04:30".
# - Add 5 minutes to current. current becomes "04:35".
# It can be proven that it is not possible to convert current to correct in fewer than 3 operations.
#
# Constraints:
# current and correct are in the format "HH:MM"
# 	current <= correct
#
