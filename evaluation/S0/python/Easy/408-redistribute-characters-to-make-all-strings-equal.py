# Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/redistribute-characters-to-make-all-strings-equal/   |   Difficulty: Easy
#
# Problem Description:
# You are given an array of strings words (0-indexed).
#
# In one operation, pick two distinct indices i and j, where words[i] is a non-empty string, and move any character from words[i] to any position in words[j].
#
# Return true if you can make every string in words equal using any number of operations, and false otherwise.
#
# Example:
# Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Move the first 'a' in words[1] to the front of words[2],
# to make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc".
# All the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.
#
# Constraints:
# 1 <= words.length <= 100
# 	1 <= words[i].length <= 100
# 	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
#
