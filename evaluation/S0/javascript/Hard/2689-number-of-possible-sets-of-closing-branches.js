// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-possible-sets-of-closing-branches/   |   Difficulty: Hard
//
// Problem Description:
// There is a company with n branches across the country, some of which are connected by roads. Initially, all branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.
//
// The company has realized that they are spending an excessive amount of time traveling between their branches. As a result, they have decided to close down some of these branches (possibly none). However, they want to ensure that the remaining branches have a distance of at most maxDistance from each other.
//
// The distance between two branches is the minimum total traveled length needed to reach one branch from another.
//
// You are given integers n, maxDistance, and a 0-indexed 2D array roads, where roads[i] = [ui, vi, wi] represents the undirected road between branches ui and vi with length wi.
//
// Return the number of possible sets of closing branches, so that any branch has a distance of at most maxDistance from any other.
//
// Note that, after closing a branch, the company will no longer have access to any roads connected to it.
//
// Note that, multiple roads are allowed.
//
// Example:
// Input: n = 3, maxDistance = 5, roads = [[0,1,2],[1,2,10],[0,2,10]]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The possible sets of closing branches are:
// - The set [2], after closing, active branches are [0,1] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.
// - The set [0,1], after closing, the active branch is [2].
// - The set [1,2], after closing, the active branch is [0].
// - The set [0,2], after closing, the active branch is [1].
// - The set [0,1,2], after closing, there are no active branches.
// It can be proven, that there are only 5 possible sets of closing branches.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 10
// 	1 <= maxDistance <= 105
// 	0 <= roads.length <= 1000
// 	roads[i].length == 3
// 	0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1
// 	ui != vi
// 	1 <= wi <= 1000
// 	All branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.
//
