// Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/   |   Difficulty: Medium
//
// Problem Description:
// You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:
//
//
// 	Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
// 	Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
// 	Surround: The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the region with 'X' cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the board.
//
//
// To capture a surrounded region, replace all 'O's with 'X's in-place within the original board. You do not need to return anything.
//
// Example:
// Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
//
// Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
//
// Explanation:
//
// In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.
//
// Constraints:
// m == board.length
// 	n == board[i].length
// 	1 <= m, n <= 200
// 	board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
//

/**
 * @param {character[][]} board
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
